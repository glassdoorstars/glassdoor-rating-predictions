This flexibility allows for a better work-life balance and can accommodate personal commitments. Independence: Freelancers are their own bosses, which means they have more control over the projects they take on and the clients they work with. This autonomy can lead to greater job satisfaction. Diverse Income Streams: Freelancers can work with multiple clients simultaneously, diversifying their income streams and reducing the risk of relying solely on one employer. Skill Development: Freelancers often have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different industries. This exposure can lead to continuous skill development and a broader professional network. Location Independence: Freelancers can often work from anywhere with an internet connection. This opens up the possibility of traveling while working and enjoying a digital nomad lifestyle. Cons: Income Instability: Freelancers may experience irregular income flows, especially when starting or during slow periods. There is no guarantee of a fixed salary, and it requires diligent financial planning. Lack of Benefits: Freelancers typically do not receive traditional employee benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off. They are responsible for managing their own benefits. Client Management: Freelancers have to handle client communication, project management, and billing themselves. This can be time-consuming and may take away from billable hours. Self-Employment Taxes: Freelancers are considered self-employed and are responsible for paying their own taxes, including both income tax and self-employment tax, which can be complex and require meticulous record-keeping. Isolation and Loneliness: Working as a freelancer can be isolating, especially if they work from home. It lacks the social interactions that come with traditional office environments, which can lead to feelings of loneliness. Overall, freelancing can be a rewarding career choice for those who value independence and flexibility. However, it also comes with certain challenges that require careful consideration and preparation.\\nFlexibility: As a freelancer, you have the flexibility to choose your own hours and workload.

I never for a second doubted the validity of the products and services we provided clients. Kind of a backhanded pro- every mistake is fixable.\\nGreat job coming out of college.\\n- In our specific location, the Advisors are extremely smart and good-hearted people - Also in our specific location, our leaders want everyone to succeed (the false info that anyone wants anyone to quit or fail is ridiculous, training costs a lot of time and money, and we are incentivized to keep people around longer, like any career) - The internship is difficult, but super rewarding if it\\'s the right fit for you - There is room to disagree and make your voice heard\\nEntrepreneurship- great for people who want to bet on themselves with no guaranteed salary\\nMet some cool people Work life balance\\nThe people are the best and everyone is willing to help each other out.

However, with plenty of help from the organization I have been able to get fully licensed in the work we do as well as build a clientele. The work is difficult but highly rewarding. Having the flexibility to take time off and work the hours that work for me is a huge benefit as well as having no cap on commission. I stay at Northwestern because I know I want to be in the finance industry and quite frankly there isn\\'t a company that I have seen that does as good of a job with comprehensive financial planning on the insurance AND investment pieces of the plan for the client. If management and mentorship is something that is interesting to you there is no shortage of opportunity at NM. I would highly recommend test driving this opportunity and career to anyone that has any desire to be in finance, be a business owner, wants more autonomy, or more income. The career is not for everyone but I don\\'t see myself ever leaving. - Autonomy - No income cap on commission only - Best in industry products and services - Mentorship and leadership opportunities\\nGreat leadership!

You get real good experience. Very well run organization. People think it\\'s a pyramid scheme but it\\'s not. They give you the tools to help you be successful. Full time reps have to call a minimum of 40 calls a day. Interns its 20. You get thicker skin and learn rejection and learn to be persistent. Northwestern Mutual is the best Financial company to work at. I looked at the numbers and what they do for people, they are the industries best. New York Life and Mass Mutual are a good 2nd and 3rd.\\nGreat training programs. Great mentorship. Freedom to start your own book of business\\nNM actively listens to feedback from the field and has high standards around compliance to ensure business is done well. They will pay for your continuing education.\\nProvide a lot of benefits and abilities to grow and learn\\nDon\\'t expect this career to be easy, but it is rewarding. No base income and you are a business owner day one. Company values and planning are unbeatable. If you\\'re comfortable talking to people about their personal finances and are able to get consistent referrals, this career can put you in a great financial position. If you aren\\'t comfortable talking to people about their personal finances and asking for referrals at least 80% of the time, look somewhere else and save yourself time and energy.

The insurance and investment products that we sell are also great options\\nThe pros of being an advisor at Northwestern Mutual would start with the great training program and support of the office staff. They make sure you have all the material you need to learn about the industry and hit the ground running. They also cover the cost of your investment license exams which is a nice little perk. I really enjoy the San Jose office because I can bounce ideas off other advisors here who are willing to help me out in any way they can. It is a very \"self motivated\" type of job but having a lot of support feels nice and makes it a little easier. Also the ability to grow your income through both insurance and investments is great.\\nCares about its employees and listens to what is working and not working\\nClearwater Culture is one for the books. After being in the medical industry for 12y and living through a pandemic, culture become more important to me. We spend the majority of our working lives with people and making sure there is a culture is imperative. I also enjoy all the healthy competition and helping to keep people accountable. This career can be difficult, so to see the support that everyone has for each other is nice.\\nProfessional work environment, easy to get the information you need to stay up to date on new products/procedures and easy to keep up to date to do your job. Overall friendly and easy interactions internally among the field as well as with corporate. Good work-life balance, no need to work outside of your scheduled hours (but I work as staff).\\nCulture. Everyone has been there for 15 years plus it seems. People care about their job and the work. There are so many knowledgeable people that help get you the answers you need and to support you.\\nThey treated the interns amazingly. So many intern events and learning opportunities.\\nWeekly pay for CSR positions. Healthcare benefits are available day one of hire. Pays into employees\\' pension immediately even if employee decides not to contribute to 401K.\\n',\n",
       "  'cons': 'a bit tough if you don\\'t have a good network of people to get referrals!\\nVery little training on investments, primarily around portfolio building/management as they have you use cookie cutter portfolios. Bad work life balance as they have mandatory meetings, which can be out of state at times, that can get in the way of family duties. Internal work environment is demanding with very little leeway to have bad days or weeks before being let go. This might be due to management/coaches never being advisors them selfs. Also it is a good/bad thing but every office is run differently with what feels like different standards.\\nCommission based and a bit confusing management style. You have to work hard to make it work and you are treated more like an employee vs a business owner.\\nThis job is not for everyone. Need patience and too be extremely skillful enough to retain lots of information during training which can be overwhelming at times. Not enough time to manage workload, lots of employee turnover due to high volume and stress. It will take a long time (2 years to become comfortable at your job). Clients and field reps can be high stress that make it hard to find a medium between work life balance and mental health during work. Can feel more like a call center job where the goal is to just answer phone calls, where downtime is limited and therefore the becomes a little too much for the effort needed. There is seniority list when hired. Makes it extremely harder to take days off especially spontaneously throughout the year.\\nBoth roles at NM I had new managers that were new to management and new to NM. They did not align with the sincerity and career support that the heads of NM were touting.\\nextremley misleading. was not informed that series 6 sponsorship is gatekept behind making 5 clients, then found out that you only get .5 client credit when doing JW so it is essentially 10. Still unsure of how i am compensated. as well as how my 401k / pension works. management really only tries to motivate you, but doesn\\'t provide any actual help or leads. only real leadership sessions / Q&As are super early in the morning. other than that good luck getting questions answered\\n- very judgmental - they pick favorites - fake management - hostile environment - looked down upon if you are not participating in their “team building” aka drinking at the bar downstairs after work - will put you in uncomfortable situations - 100% not inclusive for those who don\\'t conform to their standards literally if you are anywhere outside the “norm” (white, straight, cisgender, status quo, attractive by their standards) just prepare to be outcasted - passive aggressive management - also just the fact that you’re trying to sell this job to people usually recent college grads desperate for a job, knowing full well that it’s a scam and if someone starts they are very unlikely to make any money at all, yet your telling them they’ll be making six figures - could probably say way more but you get the point\\nMicromanaging. All about performance performance performance. numbers numbers numbers. I understand these affect the company as a whole but throwing an employee in right away with little training and knowledge does not help. All they want is for people to be on the phones and take calls. Coaches and leadership do what they can, and what they are allowed, but in the end higher up management needs to handle training better. They hire 3-4 groups a year of 50+ people, and have such a high turnover rate due to people not feeling confident in the job, due to not being trained effectively.\\nThey just sell you this dream of how much money you will make by selling a product that they will never see that is only helpful if you are dead. Interesting business concept.\\nCan be stressful. Pressure to be excellent can outweigh financial benefits.\\n- Requirement to be in the office, even in a job where the day-to-day doesn\\'t require being in a specific location - Yearly salary adjustments are capped at an average of 2% per year - Ad-hoc salary adjustment to align with the market are rare - Still are missing the 401k match - Still have to wait 3 years to be vested in the Cash Balance Retirment Plan - Have to pay to park in the structures that the company owns, and completely subsidized during the pandemic (2+ years of no parking charges, but still could park in our assigned structure/spot) (referenced by \"free\" lunches above)\\nA lot of training is required but isn’t provided. A lot of hunting down the information and having to develop a sense of what is right and what is incorrect. They say there is support for all your questions and all you are trying to accomplish but a lot of the time it comes down to piecing together knowledge from experience and hoping you got the right answer.\\nA little cliquey at times but nothing terrible\\n- NM has a bad rap due to larger cities hiring a ton of people and adopting a \"sink or swim\" attitude - The internship is awesome, but ONLY for kids who want to move into the career. If they don\\'t, it is extremely specialized learning and activity.\\nYou\\'re on your own- they know that. They don’t pay you to “incentivize you” to work harder but really it’s not a healthy structure.\\nPoor leadership Seems scammy Unrealistic recruitment numbers Lack of communication Micromanagement Culty vibes/drink the koolaid Lack of growth opportunities Pay was really low and the bonus structure was for things outside of control.\\nYou have to really have a drive to be successful here. Come to work to learn new things and really put the effort in. It is hard at first but once you learn and get a routine the job does get easier.\\nThis was the worst job ever!! On the phone all day and Management tracking you and listening to every single word that you said and then analyzing you on those words. 4-5 months of training on a subject that I knew NOTHING about and then they expect you to be proficient on all your phone calls! Forget about taking your PTO in your first year, because you are bottom of the seniority and everyone above you gets to choose first. It is a joke!! Then you are only given 20 minutes a day to finish up your cases from the 55+ calls that you take a day. Ain\\' NO free lunch worth the stress of this job!!! You get graded on your phone calls and then get a coaching session and they tell you everything that you did wrong. But sure do not give you any pats on the back at what you did right!! The coach\\'s and managers are completely rude and condescending! This job is very bully like. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy!! When my training class started, we had over 50 of us and after it was over, almost half had already dropped out. I sure wish I would have, because then I would not have PTSD from staying for over a year.\\nYour experience is highly dependent on the team/Advisor you work with. It is possible to have both good and bad experience at the company, there is no consistency for the support staff across the entire company.\\nStipends are small and only last a year No guaranteed paycheck No pay stubs and communication with accounting is lacking\\n- Pump and dump for people\\'s connections - You will become an insurance salesman who has to sell out to all friends and family to keep a roof over your head. - Leadership is obsessed with daily \"numbers\", which every advisor inflates to keep management out of their way. - Pay structure is incredibly over-inflated - You are not, and never will be a true advisor if you have to peddle insurance constantly - never-ending cold call - Cannot retain talent - Management picks favorites and cuts checks to keep them afloat, but average, emerging advisors, aren\\'t even able to pay for rent - They expect 3+ months of savings because they know you will quit before 3 months, and at that point, they don\\'t have to pay you, and they have all of your work and connections\\nMisleading Job title of \"Financial Rep\" as insurance is their primary intent. Internship is a way for MDs, MPs, and FT advisors to exploit the network of college kids in hopes they end up leaving at the end of the summer. They emphasize insurance business to a degree of disgust and on their books no-one becomes a client until an insurance product is placed (even if investments occur prior). Many refer to it as a pyramid scheme which is false, but I will admit there are characteristics of a pyramid scheme through their \"warm market\" and \"word of mouth\" referral model.\\nLong hours, extremely difficult starting out, non-guaranteed pay, lots of phoning\\nhard to sell insurance when your new in the game\\nYour opportunities for work and growth are contingent upon the advisor(s) you work for if you aren’t a disciplined self starter with long term goals. 0 corporate governance or accountability on some advisory teams.\\nNational Training Program is a lot but it\\'s good information.\\nChallenging, but meaningful work with unlimited upside.\\nWhat makes this career difficult is when you are first starting and don\\'t have a clientele yet that generates residual income you are still commission only. Some people have a fast start and some don\\'t and that can be challenging. Additionally, NM does not supply it\\'s advisors with leads. Leads are self-generated or referred to you. You don\\'t need to try and make your friends and family all clients, but trying to get referred to professionals or families they may know is the best way to build your clientele. If that still isn\\'t your cup of tea there are advisors who will just network with medicals professionals or attorneys or whatever sector you are looking to work with and then get referred out from there. It\\'s difficult but the payoff in my opinion is worth it.\\nIt is commission only. SIE, Series 6 and 63 are required.\\nVery strict quotas to meet. I wouldn’t recommend this job to a single parent, especially if they lack a strong personal support system.\\nA lot on your plate the first few months\\nToo much work I had to put in.\\nThe job is valued based upon the skills needed and not the return it brings. This position has a ceiling. Know when you reach it and move on as there are few options to move up. High turnover.\\nOverworked & Defiitely Under Paid. Horrible communication between management and employees.\\nNo hourly pay, work strictly on commissions. Better. have a good. network. of people or you\\'re screwed and have to resort to cold calling. If you resort to cold calling, I would recommend calling 100-200 people a day. Yes, a day.\\nCommission and bonus pay. Hard to generate significant income early on.\\nLimited upward mobility unless you want to be an Financial Advisor\\nSmaller sectors do not pay as much as others\\nYou work directly with consumers, therefore you will experience the worst in people. Expect to be avoided by people, no-showed, cancelled on, and do thankless work.\\nIt is incredibly difficult to recruit for a commission-only job. Be prepared to hear \"no\" a lot.\\nRunning your own business, so it won\\'t be easy\\nLong Work Hours No work /life balance Job responsibilities outside of your job requirements\\n- Cold calling family, friends, and referrals. -They say there isn\\'t cold calling but essentially its what your doing. -Don\\'t expect to get paid for months. - should have close to if not more than 15k saved up before starting. - If you leave they will bill you for network days and insurance. - they expect you to work 12+ hours a day -very much micro management even though they sell you on the idea of \"owning your own business and schedule\" you will have to show up for \"mandatory\" things. They can\\'t say mandatory but basically if you don\\'t show up they will let you go. - They will sell you on the idea that your going to make 200k within 3 years. Don\\'t drink the Kool-Aid. Several advisors while I was there were moving in with their parent, getting foreclosure notices, barely scrapping by and they were doing everything required if not more! - you have to meet minimum requirements to work there. Therefore not owning your own business like they claim. - Pretty much everything they sold me on to get in the door was not accurate and several advisors were complaining to me when I started about how much its not like anything they tell you. - Even if you made a sale you had to wait several weeks before seeing money due to underwriting and paperwork. -basically to succeed you need to be cold calling constantly, have no personal life, and no bills to pay. They tell you right away in training you should be working 12+ hours a day and a minimum 5 days a week to succeed. They think 2 hours a day with your family is enough.\\n3-4 months before getting paid to build your client base.\\nBe prepared to split most if not all of your first year deals with \"senior\" advisors. Job is commission only and very difficult to hit metrics and receive your stipend. No matter how many years of previous experience you have before you came to NM you are HIGHLY encouraged to split your deals with a \"senior\" advisor that will charge you 60-70% of your comp to help with the account.\\n- Lack of management and structure - Poor communication - Coarse work environment\\nMy Cons are more Network related that company related: * No local support. * Do what I say instead of teaching & training of why No financial stability your first 5 years Very difficult to get started in.\\nSlow to innovate due to buy in from every department along with protection of each team can cause issues for moving things forward.\\nDo not provide leads Most endeavors will be covered out of pocket\\nThere is not a lot of room for vertical movement.\\n- Over Insure People (at times) - Some are in it for the money and not actually helping people - Work Life Balance can be mismanaged depending on who you work with\\nDepending on the agency you’re in you don’t get work remote. Some travel but not always required.\\nThe first few years are a grind, put in the work that is mapped out for you and you will succeed!\\nThere have been layoffs recently. There is no 401k match currently. Instead, they contribute extra to a pension account, but you are only fully vested after three years. If you are laid off before then, you don\\'t get anything.\\nMust reach out to family and friends, it makes sense why but isn\\'t the best.\\nno cons in this role\\nThis was the worst job ever!!

This specific job is great for those who like to work independently (sometimes the advisor has a team, it depends) and doesn\\'t need a whole lot of direction. If you like to be much more interactive and very team-oriented or need a lot of direction to accomplish tasks, this specific field role might be a tough fit. But corporate is probably more up that alley.\\nIt’s so large that it sometimes hard to get things done quickly because of so much signoff needed.\\nI struggled in a remote environment.\\nIf the thought of 6-7 months training gives you anxiety, this may not be the position for you.

My colleagues and managers are like a second family to me, and you have a lot of career options to find the best fit for you. I’m proud to work at such a reputable and prestigious company. There are feedback tools in place, and they will listen and make changes if you offer a solution to a problem. I once submit feedback that my customers wanted a way for their you get children to manage their allowance through a bank account with an app like their own to review balances and savings - I asked and they listened! And now we have Youth Solutions for kids 6years old to 17th years old to start talking to kids about money and building good financial habits early.

       "  'cons': 'Salary and pay scale are not different between roles\\n-your consideration for annual raises depends on how your manager appraises your performance. the rating scale is not consistent. what counts as \"strong\" for one person is someone else\\'s \"on track\". -pto can be hard to get approved during peak vacation times -training is provided for career mobility however this means actual career mobility can be extremely competitive. when a title change is achieved there\\'s no guarantee it will come with a pay increase.\\nStaffing can be terrible which means work life balance can be tenuous. Customers can really be awful but don’t let it deter you…just build a resiliency and learn to approach them from curiosity and compassion.\\nBase salary is low, very sales focused. Has a retail like sensation. Too big, does not provide the proper support to employees to own client issues. Under compensated for the amount of work and knowledge required\\nBad internal systems are problematic when helping clients. The company has a unified senior management cover for its employees, but the disconnects are everywhere. Bankers are constantly asked to complete unnecessary busy work under the pretense it adds value to customers. Incentive plans are always changing. The stress and inequity make everyone depressed and mean to customers. Branch managers lack leadership and managerial skills. And are a huge reason the turnover rate is so high.\\nLike most sales jobs, the position expectations are always changing.\\nUnfair interview process in background check. And they waste your time the offer you a job and then pull the offer With no explanation. It Does not matter if you have a clean criminal record. When you try to ask for a reason they don\\'t give you one, they just cast You aside. If you apply here, do not give you\\'re current job a notice until background clears. If you don\\'t, that will be the biggest mistake of your life. Don\\'t be swayed by the salary offer because it\\'s not guaranteed. Just by the start that they pulled with me.

Extremely stressful to handle all of the unique customer requests while maintaining outdated overall customer satisfaction (OSAT) scores. Managers are now managing multiple locations, leaving the Lead Associate to be the manager on duty with significantly lower pay.\\nThe commission plan is eh. There is no benefit to retain relationships as your commision is one and done. Regardles of the balance your client maintains or products they are involved in. A million dollar investment brings you in 1,500 gross. They can only incentivize deposits so much since the bank has to be careful with how many Deposits are on their balance sheets. Credit cards you get paid 40 bucks per card but they make much much more off of it. Base is low for licensed bankers. To max comp is more than a grind, it\\'s exhausting. More so, the job is looked downed upon by many and you are a doormat for customers, more so than most jobs.

You\\'ve gotten rid of personal bankers only to put all the responsibly on the associate bankers for what reason. You either want us on the transaction line or you want us on the platform side why is it both? And then we aren\\'t staffed currently to be able to accomplish this. Go back to bankers being bankers and tellers being tellers. Because if someone calls off then what? Your associate bankers are exhausted and they feel under appreciated. Not to mention there is a huge safety risk involved. Customers being completely unreasonable and beggars outside branch, there needs to be security at all branches. Only with the 2 months of security did I ever feel safe in the branch. Overall, I\\'m sure the experience is different on the corporate side but the branch side needs help from us top not cutting corners and making their already difficult and stressful job more difficult and stressful.\\nSometimes they make changes for you that are inconvenient to your career aspirations, such as remove the role you are in. For example they removed the Personal Banker role from retail banking a few years back, so all of us had to either become Licensed Relationship Bankers or go be an Associate Banker (formerly tellers) or find another line of business altogether in the company or take the compensation package. To their credit, they gave us plenty of time to make the decision, but in my experience it felt like my ascent to Relationship Banker was painfully slow because their was now 5,000 other Personal Bankers brewing to get the same roles, and in my market area they reduced staff positions at the same time. So I had to be willing to look outside of my home market to find a relationship banker position. In the end that was the best decision for me, but it was hard that all these changes happened at once seemed to conspire against me staying in my home branch.\\nCommunication is non-existant.

A MUCH better and collaborative way to encourage your employees to choose a healthy lifestyle would be to offer incentives/discounts for certain demographics instead of penalizing those who may not have the time to have an active lifestyle, in part due to the amount of time that is expected for them to work because of constant staffing issues.\\nLimited Advancement Opportunities: While I value my current role and its responsibilities, there have been moments when I\\'ve noticed a relatively narrow scope for career advancement within certain areas of the organization. Communication Challenges: At times, there appears to be room for improvement in the communication flow between different teams department. This can be occasionally lead to MAJOR delay or terrible misunderstandings and we deal with sick patients that need results ASAP. Workload Overload: there are periods when the workload can overwhelm the tiny crew scheduled for that day requiring rapid adaptation to meet demands. We get absolutely no help from the \"higher-ups\" Balancing these types of days with our regular responsibilities can be impossible and we\\'ve adapted the attitude \"if THEY don\\'t care; we don\\'t care.\"\\nALWAYS short staffed so you never have a chance to slow down enough to not risk making mistakes. The most unfriendly coworkers I have ever encountered in my entire career! If they don’t just ignore you, they will be backstabbing you. There are a few wonderful exceptions to that though. No uniform training in new areas of work. What you learn depends on who is training you. Everyone has a slightly different take on how it’s done. The SOP are worthless, key points are completely missing. SOPs are individual word documents that for the most part are not searchable, and not necessarily indexed to area of use. A major disconnect between what is going on, needed to do the job, and management. If you try to explain to the day shift lead why you haven’t gotten something done, you may get the unprofessional behavior of actually being yelled at. Think twice before hiring on, it’s a factory mentality.\\nIt\\'s difficult to be fair with criticisms having only been at a company for 90 days. I\\'ve been positively impressed with the people I team with - all are contributors and appear to care about what they do. The main problem I see is there are good managers managing in areas they have little to no experience in. I come from a strong distribution/logistics background and it\\'s difficult to remain patient with processes that cause the gears of the organization to grind rather than move freely and efficiently. I\\'m not sure if the problem is in the recruitment process, if favoritism is a factor or why people aren\\'t matched to their area of expertise. I still need more time to evaluate fairly based on what happens in the next 3-6 months rather than stand on impressions alone.\\nLow pay with small annual raises with a night differential. Job duties and responsibilities increased but for the same pay. The added job duties brought me into contact with the accessioning department which caused me to dislike the job due to there supervisor screaming and staring when she was upset. I was a supervisor at my previous job and hope and pray that I never treated an employee that badly. Helps to have some supervision training and there are some great books and courses available. I quit soon after that embarrassing incident. This was a job I took after retiring from my career after 26 years .\\nSadly bonuses are not really existent since Covid was a thing.\\nAverage pay scale and benefits\\nLab medicine takes place 24/7/365, so there may be evening or night work, but you will receive a shift differential. Entry level positions are hard work and extremely fast paced, but skilled and technical positions are well paid, respected, and have a lot of opportunity for advancement into leadership roles if you so choose.\\nLab medicine takes place 24/7/365, so there may be evening or night work, but you will receive a shift differential. Entry level positions are hard work and extremely fast paced, but skilled and technical positions are well paid, respected, and have a lot of opportunity for advancement into leadership roles if you so choose.\\nMerit increases could be more than the base 2%-3% annual offering.\\nThe processes and procedures are the worst here. The company is very slow with making effective change.\\nYou have to work on the holidays and most have to work on the weekends\\nLong hours, and the pay was okay.\\nAny type of raise or promotion comes with a slow grind, as you would expect at a large company with multiple levels of management. The work volume was too big for the team and we were pressured to stay overtime on a weekly basis.\\nRoom for growth is not great. Only individuals that advance in the company are ones who are CLOSE to mgt. H\\nWhere to begin. Little job satisfaction or recognition. You\\'re made aware of how expendable you are. They won\\'t out right fire you they draw out the process. They take your phone, walk you out then they bombard you with communications. Begining with dissecting your work habits. They eventually flip over a rock and there it is you\\'ve been taking long lunches and working late without supervision. During this suspension period they do keep the checks coming. If there is such a thing as a skin-flint outfit or \"canned\" job this would be the place. Their pay is middle of the road as are benefits which to qualify for require a humiliating physical including annual blood draw. I kid you not. They tap you for 20ul and weigh you. Oh yes you have to do this or pay for insurance via the medical market place, if you smoke you are charged more, while unhealthy it\\'s your decision to smoke, overweight? They charge you more. Talk about a bull.... feature of employment what next drug testing and lord knows what manner of imposition. What run a 6 minute mile? Coercion is a staple at LabCorp. They hire mostly foreigners that can\\'t work anyplace else. Need a green card? Sign your name. Step up and get your slave wages. They are so cocky. They expect you to buy a company Tshirt? Not joking.\\nThe only downside that I have experienced is that my starting pay is a little bit lower than my last job, and I\\'m starting to feel that change with personal finances. Also, more training with cash register and taking payments would be nice.\\nNone, this is my favorite sales job I\\'ve ever had.\\nPay could be better since we handle specimens\\nHeavy workloads, difficult work/life balance\\nHaven\\'t seen any bad things at LabCorp that would make me dislike the company in anyway.\\nYou have to work on the holidays and most have to work on the weekends\\nLong hours, and the pay was okay.\\nNone to my knowledge at this point.\\nAny type of raise or promotion comes with a slow grind, as you would expect at a large company with multiple levels of management. The work volume was too big for the team and we were pressured to stay overtime on a weekly basis.\\nDirect report was fantastic, but sometimes higher up managers would skip chain of command and would lead to some awkward communication issues. Travel depending on your lifestyle, if you never pushed back could easily end up traveling every 3-6 months for two weeks at a time, network upgrades/acquisitions etc. Depending on what role you take, sometimes coordination and coworkers on the same team are in different countries which can lead to some atypical work hours, but they were very flexible on how you reappropriate your time.\\nLong hours for less pay. Wished we had more blood or etc to process in lab room.\\nRoom for growth is not great. Only individuals that advance in the company are ones who are CLOSE to mgt. H\\nPay is a little low if you work 1st shift A lot of video trainings/exams Need to review over 200 SOPs before real lab work is allowed.\\nPay could be better since we handle specimens\\nmanagement benefits aren\\'t that great 401k matching is only 5%\\nHeavy workloads, difficult work/life balance\\nManagement allows toxic work environment and there is nepotism with employees that are causing more harm than good. A lot of high-school minded employees that start drama and who goof off more than work while staff that are professional and hard workers are undermined. Fire people and be more professional as younger managers, you aren\\'t holding up to past managers that have retired. Too much leniancy and lack of professionalism with favorited employees.\\nLittle to no recognition for work, steep penalties for poor work\\nToo much micromanaging, software outdated and slow sometimes\\nPay isnt worth it if you aren\\'t planning to utilize tuition benefits or already have a degree and plan on moving into a different department or lab.\\nTraining was minimum before being thrown on the job which caused a lot of tension\\nConstantly pushed to overwork yourself, very little pay considering what you’re doing/the times they want you to work at, absolutely thankless work, not an ounce of appreciation for what you do from management. There is very little training given for what is very difficult and important work and they will punish you for not doing things you aren’t trained on correctly. There is zero communication from the higher ups to management to the accessioners. Management will actively lie to you to get you to stay, the turnover is incredibly high and they are desperate for people to stay but will not find out why they leave or try to fix those reasons. The benefits are embarrassing and you are actively punished for doing well at your job, there is no bonus or benefit to performing well. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!! If you have to work here do not do it longer than 6 months, leave and work somewhere better.\\nI can\\'t really think of a downside\\nCons: Management; Communication, Leadership. I don’t know if I came bad time but nun of my personal information has/had done correctly I’m still having issues; Money, Pay Date, Computer Access Etc. Also false job advertised; Hired as this now I’m this, and gotta do this without notice.\\nCan be mentally and physically demanding.\\nPay was terrible and hardly any bonuses. The biggest bonus I got once was .30 cents in a year.\\nI have yet to encounter any cons.\\nIssues with supplies and other departments, Too much administrative work\\nIn my current role, the demands of the job can be quite challenging, and I\\'ve observed that there could be room for improvement in terms of employee support and management attention to well-being.\\nNo growth not alot of promotions\\nA job that repeats itself so it did become very boring quickly and it’s an overnight job with little opportunities to work a normal 9-5 shift.\\nNeed more hours in a day to remember what all to complete.\\nMerit increases pitiful compared to how they work you, wellness program discriminates. Pa higher rates if you don’t meat BMI, A1C, cholesterol, when they are actually make ng you sick. They claim to be diverse because they can pay lower salaries to other ethnicities. They lose samples the sugarcoat the reasons, can’t find a Supervisor when a client requests to speak to one, large accounts get grandfathered under Hospital services because of the revenue they bring. Some old buildings full of mold, labs dangerously understaffed, everything is about the bottom line.\\nlearning opportunities difficult to come by.\\nPay is a little low\\n- Pay could be better\\nHorrible communication skills between management and employees\\nThe changed ownership and increased their matrix\\nSometimes nothing to do, lack of direction at times\\nNone at this time still undergoing changes (management, staffing…)\\nHight volume and high turnover\\nNo work life balance, schedules are random and when you leave for the day depends on fedex/ups shipments, mandatory OT, pay is not enough for the cost of living\\nNot competitive pay and benefits\\nAnalyzers needed much maintenance, ext Ned’s to working hours\\nIn some cases, we do see promotions occur too quickly where employees don\\'t have the experience needed to excel in their new positions. Line manager support and mentorship are particularly important in these cases, as employees stretch into new roles and assignments.\\nChronically understaffed, which is not necessarily managements fault, but I think the requirements for the position I was in were a little too much. I have a degree in microbiology, so I was able to eventually read urine culture plates (which I agree absolutely requires a related degree and experience to perform), but for the majority of my tasks, a bachelors degree was absolutely not necessary to perform 90% of the tasks we did on a day to day basis. The PTO policy for our lab, specifically, was horrible. In our department, there is the pre-analytical side of things and the tech (analytical side aka MLS/MLT side of things). The policy was that no more than two people from either side can be out per day per shift (so, only one from pre and one from tech, or two from tech etc), but this rule was frequently waived in favor of the more senior technical staff. Additionally, these time off requests have to be submitted MONTHS in advanced to be considered. Not approved, considered. At the beginning of the year, everyone in the lab submits their PTO requests for the next 5 or 6 months (yes, really), and supervisors take a few weeks to hash out the PTO schedule. Your requests are not guaranteed. I had around 120 PTO hours sitting in my time off bank by the time i left that I wasn\\'t able to use because of this policy. My peers would frequently get denied their requests, so it got to a point where I just didn\\'t even bother to put in requests. I shouldn\\'t complain too much because i was paid out for those hours when i left the company, but truthfully i would have prefered to use those hours to spend time with my family.\\nHigh workload and different platforms to handle.\\nNot really any I can think of\\nYou\\'re stuck doing someone else\\'s job if there\\'s a shortage of people in one department.\\nOnce Covance got bought out, the benefits went downhill from there.

If you want to go into another position they will do everything to keep you at your current spot if you’re too good at your job.\\nCall instead, supplies, upper management\\nThe pay is complete garbage for the amount of time you spend there. All they care about is work getting done and they’re new hires who will quit in 6-9 months anyway. There is not much room for progression unless you sleep with , flirt with, or be a brown noser.

Love that place\\nUnrealistic expectations and repetitive work with little advancement.\\nWork was pretty boring most days\\nI started working at DSG fresh out of college. I was a contractor making $15/hour. Within 2 weeks of starting, I was covering an entire category of business, having the same responsibilities as the full time employees. Needless to say, I was crushing it. I was told when I started that I would have the opportunity to interview for an open role on the team 1-3 months after starting. However, my boss threw a meeting on our calendar and told us that she had hired two new people on the team. Guess who trained these full time employees? I did. The contractor trained the new full time employees. Considering the turnover is so high, I was able to interview for another open role on the team a few months following. The fact they even made me interview for a role I had been doing for 8 months is hilarious. I was made full time and given a salary of 45k (lol). Pre-covid, we were in the office full time. I would go weeks without seeing or speaking to my manager. We were on our own. One time, I came into the office and my desk was being torn down (they were turning that room into a breast pumping room). My manager was informed about this, but did nothing. One time, two contractors showed up at my desk on their first day. They had no computers, nothing. My manager was not there, so I trained them on what I could with pen and paper and sent them home. One time, we were told that we were going to split our role into two roles. 3 people on the team were selected to pilot the new role based on seniority, the other 5 of us were left doing the grunt work. We were told that after the pilot, we would have the opportunity to interview for the newer/better role. However, those 3 people were promoted without an interview. Notice how I didn\\'t even touch on how awful the actual role itself is... that\\'s a whole other story, but the culture speaks for itself: RUN.\\nIt\\'s a for-profit company - at the end of the day, what matters is quarterly financial performance, so that\\'s what drives decision-making. The day-to-day can feel disconnected from the company\\'s purpose statement. The organization of the company is murky, making it difficult to find who you need to work with to get a project done.\\n-poor management -too worried about statistics and credit cards\\nEven as a college student they were not flexible at all and many times wouldn\\'t schedule me off for exams.\\nWorst leadership from the RVP level to the top of the company. They are so worried about DEI they forget about just treating people well. The company is the worst retail experience o have ever witnessed\\nMy son worked there this summer. Was promised 2-3 shifts per week. Was often schedule for one. Horrible communication. Managers seem inexperienced and untrained.\\nDirectors were not fair with how they treated their employees\\nExpectations of salaried employees is extremely high. It is not uncommon to work beyond the required 10 hours a day and any extra work such as over nights is usually performed by the salaried management team to avoid paying hourly overtime.\\nLong amounts of standing around\\nHard to get more hours, gets boring when you have no customers in department, managers are rude sometimes.\\nendlessly having to promote credit cards constantly\\nlower than avg base salary\\nI was given the work of 4 or 5 people and expected to complete all of it alone on insane deadlines. For example, 5000 sticker markdowns in 2.5 days on random merch items located throughout the store, both sales floor and back stock. This is while I am being called up front every 10 mins to run a register (not my job), and constantly having to open fitting rooms for customers. on top of also being made to work on ship from store for hours on end (nowhere in my job description nor was it mentioned in my interviews or on-boarding). Management\\'s bonus structure/the store report card are dependent on metrics derived from price changes and ship from store completion, so expect insane workload, lack of support, and mediocre pay. I wouldn\\'t do this job again for $30/hour let alone $15.\\nIt is a retail job and it comes with it\\'s typical cons. Sometimes higher ups expect things from department that are physically impossible and cause back inventory storage to be overwhelmed.\\nYou may not always get along with your coworkers, but that\\'s with any job. Those altercations did effect my overall experience and made coming to work hard.\\nManagement would get project from Corporate and it was like a “get it done” type of vibe.\\nHorrible operations- management is incompetent and very much a “good boys club” not what you know it’s who you know. Completely racist undertones regarding theft. Wouldn’t be surprised if they’re out of business in less than 15 years.\\nThe management is questionable sometimes\\nLong hours of standing up\\nDSG needs more labor hours to get operations done (e.g., freight that comes in, apparel sets, enough cashiers up front, lazy co-workers). On top of that, the expectations often felt too high and lack of communication from managers and co-workers did not help matters. Often times, leads would do bulk of the work and understand basic operating procedures due to lack of training/labor hours to train new hires. I think this company could be better at the store level. Also had a few negative experiences with managers and co-workers leading to a negative workspace verging on toxic.\\nManagement is terrible always. never hire from within\\nI can’t be their longer\\nUnrealistic expectations and repetitive work with little advancement.\\nYou can literally be #1 in all metrics other than sales (sales are not at goal because you live in a very poor area), and not receive any store upgrades or pay raises.\\nNone, great place to work\\nI started working at DSG fresh out of college. I was a contractor making $15/hour. Within 2 weeks of starting, I was covering an entire category of business, having the same responsibilities as the full time employees. Needless to say, I was crushing it. I was told when I started that I would have the opportunity to interview for an open role on the team 1-3 months after starting. However, my boss threw a meeting on our calendar and told us that she had hired two new people on the team. Guess who trained these full time employees? I did. The contractor trained the new full time employees. Considering the turnover is so high, I was able to interview for another open role on the team a few months following. The fact they even made me interview for a role I had been doing for 8 months is hilarious. I was made full time and given a salary of 45k (lol). Pre-covid, we were in the office full time. I would go weeks without seeing or speaking to my manager. We were on our own. One time, I came into the office and my desk was being torn down (they were turning that room into a breast pumping room). My manager was informed about this, but did nothing. One time, two contractors showed up at my desk on their first day. They had no computers, nothing. My manager was not there, so I trained them on what I could with pen and paper and sent them home. One time, we were told that we were going to split our role into two roles. 3 people on the team were selected to pilot the new role based on seniority, the other 5 of us were left doing the grunt work. We were told that after the pilot, we would have the opportunity to interview for the newer/better role. However, those 3 people were promoted without an interview. Notice how I didn\\'t even touch on how awful the actual role itself is... that\\'s a whole other story, but the culture speaks for itself: RUN.\\nIt\\'s a for-profit company - at the end of the day, what matters is quarterly financial performance, so that\\'s what drives decision-making. The day-to-day can feel disconnected from the company\\'s purpose statement. The organization of the company is murky, making it difficult to find who you need to work with to get a project done.\\n-poor management -too worried about statistics and credit cards\\nNo where to really progress in company\\nLong amounts of standing around\\nHard to get more hours, gets boring when you have no customers in department, managers are rude sometimes.\\nendlessly having to promote credit cards constantly\\nlower than avg base salary\\nIt is a retail job and it comes with it\\'s typical cons. Sometimes higher ups expect things from department that are physically impossible and cause back inventory storage to be overwhelmed.\\nYou may not always get along with your coworkers, but that\\'s with any job. Those altercations did effect my overall experience and made coming to work hard.\\nManagement would get project from Corporate and it was like a “get it done” type of vibe.\\nCrazy hours, and being called last minute\\nLong hours of standing up\\nI can’t be their longer\\nPoor management and sense of direction. Expectations are unclear.\\nManagement, inaccurate scheduling, and lack of reason.\\nI was promised so many things during my time being with them. I was also constantly gaslit and belittled. Despite all of that, I still wanted/needed to go back. The very same people who I got to really know over the years and once said how knowledgeable and hard working I was, turned their back on me and I can’t even get my old job back. There is also a high school mentality and a fellow lead shoulder checked me and not a single thing was done about it.\\nYou can literally be #1 in all metrics other than sales (sales are not at goal because you live in a very poor area), and not receive any store upgrades or pay raises.\\nNone, great place to work\\nHostile and harassment took place. Low moral. Room for growth only happens for those who become friends with mangers\\nthe way management has become, makes it unbearable\\nit happened to have low pay.\\nPretty strict on meeting KPIs & company metrics\\n> Rude customers > Strict Quotas\\nThe benefits that they give you\\nMany times the people at the Corporate level seem to have a disconnect with how we address the customer needs at the retail level. Maybe some of them should go on the show Undercover Boss or rotate actually working at the retail level.\\nOffice politics can be problematic at times.\\nLow Pay, Leads are decent, no raise, work outside of job title ,store manager sucks\\nnever worked somewhere where almost everyone quit\\nBy the mall so super busy\\nNeed better benefits for full time employees\\nWorked to Death every day with no help\\nThe pay wasn\\'t the best\\nOff days are spilt and working late shifts. Dealing with AIT worldwide\\'s terrible service 90% of customers poor experience is due to them.\\nPay could be a little better but not bad.\\nPlastic walls for construction is unsightly but work seems to be moving well.\\nThe manager and assistant manager honestly don’t know what the hell they’re doing. They never listen to the employees and make our jobs worst than in need to be.\\nDid not always make process to improve easy\\nHours are tight in slow seasons\\nA manager there would hold us an hour after the store closed to \"fix\" the store but he would never come to help especially when we were short staffed. Meanwhile the other managers would come out and help check all sections\\nManagement was not the best\\nManagement is a joke, they only care about themselves and take no responsibility for their actions.\\nThey could be organized better.\\nBone none bike like you\\nWish it paid more. People steal alot.\\nWork life balance Internals don’t make as much as externals\\nSome stores are not properly cared for…should have one consistent bar for all to clear.\\nCrazy hours, and being called last minute\\nNot the best place for growth.\\nNot any real cons, sometimes slow business with nothing much to do\\nInconsistent scheduling, hard to move up within the company\\ntoo busy not enough time\\nnone, was a great experience\\n'}]"
