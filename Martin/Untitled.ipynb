    "## <u>Planning Process</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planning\n",
    "1. Clearly define the problem statement related to Natural Language Processing, determining site to scrape repositories and scope of data to scrape. Formulate intial questions. Keep in mind that GitHub's API and repository content may change over time, so **time stamp intial scrape** and ensure your scraping and data processing methods are adaptable to potential modifications in the API or repository structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As a preliminary step, identify the scripting language used in each repository by inspecting its primary programming language. This can be extracted from GitHub's repository metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a detailed README.md file documenting the project's context, dataset characteristics, and analysis procedure for easy reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acquisition and Preparation\n",
    "1. **Acquiring Data from GitHub Readme Files by Scraping the GitHub API** Must secure a GitHub token https://github.com/settings/tokens. Utilize the GitHub API to access the README files of the selected repositories. Extract the README content using API calls for each repository. Ensure you adhere to rate limits and fetch the necessary data efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Cleaning and Preparing Data Using RegEx and Beautiful Soup Libraries** Process the raw README content to remove HTML tags, code snippets, and other irrelevant elements using Beautiful Soup. Employ regular expressions (RegEx) to clean the text further by eliminating special characters, punctuation, and numbers, while retaining meaningful text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cleaning and Preparing Data Using RegEx and Beautiful Soup:** Process the raw README content to remove HTML tags, code snippets, and other irrelevant elements using Beautiful Soup. Employ regular expressions (RegEx) to clean the text further by eliminating special characters, punctuation, and numbers, while retaining meaningful text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers effectively during data loading and cleansing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Perform feature selection meticulously, identifying influential features impacting the prevalence of the chronic disease through correlation analysis, feature importance estimation, or domain expertise-based selection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Develop specialized scripts (e.g., acquire.py and wrangle.py) for efficient and consistent data acquisition, preparation, and data splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Safeguard proprietary aspects of the project by implementing confidentiality and data security measures, using .gitignore to exclude sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "1. **Exploring Data for Relevant Keyword Grouping Using Bi-grams and Unigrams:** Implement a mechanism to tokenize the cleaned text into words. Create bi-grams (pairs of adjacent words) and unigram (single word or ) from the tokenized text. Calculate the frequency of these word sequences within the repository data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This step involves:\n",
    "   - Tokenization: Split the cleaned text into individual words.\n",
    "   - Bi-gram Generation: Form pairs of adjacent words to create bi-grams.\n",
    "   - Unigram Generation: Generate sequences of single word .\n",
    "   - Frequency Calculation: Count the occurrences of each bi-gram and unigram.\n",
    "\n",
    "   By analyzing the most frequent bi-grams and unigrams, you can identify keyword groupings that occur frequently in the READMEs. These groupings could represent significant terms, programming concepts, or patterns prevalent across the repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Utilize exploratory data analysis techniques, employing compelling visualizations and relevant statistical tests to extract meaningful patterns and relationships within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "1. Carefully choose a suitable machine learning algorithm based on feature selection and features engineered, evaluating options like K- Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, tailored for the classification regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the selected machine learning models using robust libraries (e.g., scikit-learn), splitting the data, systematically evaluating multiple models with a fixed Random State value = 123 for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Train the models rigorously to ensure optimal learning and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conduct rigorous model validation techniques to assess model generalization capability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select the most effective model(e.g Logistic Regression), based on accuracy and a thorough evaluation of metrics before selecting best model to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Product Delivery\n",
    "1. Assemble a final notebook, combining superior visualizations, well-trained models, and pertinent data to present comprehensive insights and conclusions with scientific rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate a Prediction.csv file containing predictions from the chosen model on test data for further evaluation and utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maintain meticulous project documentation, adhering to scientific and professional standards, to ensure successful presentation or seamless deployment.\n",

    "## <u>Conclusion</u>\n",
    "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), our analysis delved into the linguistic patterns and language prevalence within the READMEs of the top 100 most forked repositories on GitHub. Our findings uncovered several intriguing insights. Firstly, we observed a slightly higher prevalence of the Python language within README contents, constituting 54% of the distribution compared to JavaScript's 46%. Delving into the most frequently used words, \"model\" surfaced as a dominant term across the repository ReadMe texts, particularly pronounced within the Python language. Additionally, the word \"function\" held significance across all repositories, notably emerging as the most frequent term in JavaScript. Notably, we engaged in bigram frequency analysis, revealing notable pairs of adjacent words in JavaScript code segments, such as \"function expression\" and \"npm test.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation extends beyond linguistics, embracing statistical and machine learning methodologies. The Chi-squared test confirms the intertwined relationship between programming language distribution and README content. Furthermore, t-tests on the top five most significant words unveil substantial frequency differences, deepening our understanding of language nuances. Incorporating classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, we will not use any of the classification models as none beat baseline and the model that ran the best was RandomForest which produced a Test score of 38%, 16% below baseline accuracy.  In essence, our analysis encapsulates the multifaceted landscape and challenges of predicting programming languages of GitHub README.md, while offering insights on words that resonate with Github users, developers and the evolving world of open-source coding practices.\n",

    "[Jump to Navigation](#navigation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u>Next Steps</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhance Classification Model Performance:**\n",
    "Although our classification models didn't perform well, there's an opportunity to enhance their performance by considering the following:\n",

    "1. **Language-Specific Documentation Enhancement:** Recognizing Python's higher prevalence in READMEs, capitalize on this trend by enhancing language-specific documentation. Develop comprehensive examples, tutorials, and best practices that cater to Python's prevalent usage. This approach will aid developers, especially newcomers to Python, in quickly grasping essential concepts and utilizing the language's features effectively.\n",
    "3. **Further Explore  CountVectorization and TF-IDF:** \n",
    "3. **Code Reusability and Patterns:** Responding to the significance of \"model\" and \"function\" as highly frequent terms, prioritize the promotion of code reusability and design patterns associated with these concepts. Craft libraries, modules, or templates that encapsulate common functionalities or algorithms related to models and functions. This strategic approach fosters efficient development, encourages uniform coding practices, and contributes to cohesive project architectures.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, README's from GitHub repositories are analyzed and modelled using natural language processing techniques. The repositories contain primarily \"Python\", \"Javascript\", or \"Other\" files. Repo names are scraped from the most popular repositories on GitHub. The README contents are then acquired using GitHub's API. After the data is acquired, the README contents are cleaned and prepared so they can be analyzed. Analysis and stats test will be done to compare things such as length and unique words. NLP techniques and classification models will be used to predict which language is primarily used in the GitHub repos.\n",

    "1. README's are cleaned:\n",
    "    1. characters are lowered\n",
    "    1. removed punctuation, numbers, extra whitespaces, long words, accented/special characters, and stopwords\n",
    "    1. text is tokenized (broken down into smaller units)\n",
    "    1. stemmed and lemmatized versions of the README's are saved\n",

    "Modeling:\n",
    "- Baseline accuracy was 71% on the training set and 74% on validation set.\n",
    "- The only model to beat baseline was the Logistic Regression model, which had slightly better accuracy scores or 73% on the training set and 77% on the validation set.\n",
