Remote Job (for my job title) Seems to hire and promote from within Great management Amazing work-life balance Great benefits including retirement","It's a large company so change takes time but there is continual effort to improve. I don't know about it yet I look back on my time at Lincoln and cringe wondering why I stayed for so long. Work is boring, the people are boring, and there’s no growth or clear path to promotions. They did BS promotions like going from Sr Consultant to a Director title, but the Director title didn’t afford any change or a pay increase and actually placed you in the “middle management” track, which is their way of saying…”you are worthless and we are placing you in a dead end track”. I look back now and realize that I didn’t learn anything during my near 8 years at Lincoln. It wasn’t until I left that I realized how bad it was and how depressing this company is. You actually get laid off for being too innovative. Everyone I know who had fun and exciting progressive tech ideas were let go. It’s a pretty pathetic place to work. Micro management and you work from home, mean and rude managers. The management even HR doesn’t care about anyone but themselves after you have been a great employee, provides great customer service and at the end of it all I got fired because honestly that’s just what they wanted to do. You can get 10 occurrences before you are fired, I got to 6 and then fired me but I followed the attendance policy which I explained in my termination meeting (which they fired me in the middle of my shift when they could have just saved the hassle and fired me at the beginning so I could go about my day) and then when getting fired the manager was on camera smiling. I’m sure this is not everyone’s experience nor will it be. But beware and keep your head on a swivel working for this company. Treated like robots and children. Will get in trouble if we log on to our computers after work hours. Gave our whole department 8 hrs of pto to take at once so it’s literally survival of the fittest. We work in a disability department yet they gave us NO sick time???? Get docked a point for everything, i’ve had covid, the flu, ear infections, dental work and i’ve gotten docked for everything when i literally can’t help it. A coworker of mine was logged on for 15 mins after their shift because they were on a call and they got accused of stealing company time. Have to click your mouse every 30 seconds or you’ll get docked for that. All you do is get screamed at by angry customers because their case managers don’t work in a timely fashion because how overworked they are. Also don’t try to call them because they don’t answer and are probably not even logged in because they seem to get unlimited pto and sick time unlike us!! THEY TREAT US LIKE THE CRUD OF THE OCEAN. They make up rules as we go along and once you start to investigate on your own you get shut down and says it’s out of our boundaries to do so. Look at the reviews from people who do benefits with us. TERRIBLE AND I DONT BLAME THEM Team leads are intelligent but often lack managerial skills Your experience depends on the department you are in and your position. Some roles within certain departments have trouble taking their PTO due to denied request. Compensation is lower than other companies Unfavorable Location: The job's location is inconvenient or unappealing, making commuting or relocating a challenge and potentially affecting your overall job satisfaction. Lack of Diversity: The workplace lacks diversity, leading to feelings of isolation and discomfort, especially if you belong to a minority group. Generic Atmosphere: The work environment feels generic and lacking in uniqueness or character, which can contribute to a lack of engagement and enthusiasm. Cultural Alienation: The lack of diversity and the sense of being out of place as a minority can lead to feelings of cultural alienation and hinder your ability to connect with coworkers. Status Quo Stagnation: The presence of a status quo or a resistant attitude towards change can create an environment where innovation and fresh ideas struggle to thrive, potentially limiting professional growth. Limited Career Progression: The requirement of obtaining a bachelor's degree or waiting for specific opportunities to arise for growth can lead to frustration and a perception of limited career progression. Dependency on Others: Relying on someone else quitting or an agent hiring you as a personal assistant for career advancement puts your professional trajectory out of your control, potentially leading to feelings of helplessness. Financial Instability: The job's financial constraints, especially during emergencies, can cause stress and uncertainty, affecting your overall well-being. Lack of Inclusion: The sense of being out of place can lead to exclusion from important discussions, decisions, and social interactions, impacting your sense of belonging within the workplace. Diminished Motivation: The lack of diversity, an unengaging atmosphere, and limited growth opportunities can collectively contribute to reduced motivation and job satisfaction. I am unsure of any at the moment. Maybe a little more pay but I am honestly unsure of how their pay compares across other employers.It's a large company so change takes time but there is continual effort to improve.

I look back now and realize that I didn’t learn anything during my near 8 years at Lincoln. It wasn’t until I left that I realized how bad it was and how depressing this company is. You actually get laid off for being too innovative. Everyone I know who had fun and exciting progressive tech ideas were let go. It’s a pretty pathetic place to work. Micro management and you work from home, mean and rude managers. The management even HR doesn’t care about anyone but themselves after you have been a great employee, provides great customer service and at the end of it all I got fired because honestly that’s just what they wanted to do. You can get 10 occurrences before you are fired, I got to 6 and then fired me but I followed the attendance policy which I explained in my termination meeting (which they fired me in the middle of my shift when they could have just saved the hassle and fired me at the beginning so I could go about my day) and then when getting fired the manager was on camera smiling. I’m sure this is not everyone’s experience nor will it be. But beware and keep your head on a swivel working for this company. Treated like robots and children. Will get in trouble if we log on to our computers after work hours. Gave our whole department 8 hrs of pto to take at once so it’s literally survival of the fittest. We work in a disability department yet they gave us NO sick time???? Get docked a point for everything, i’ve had covid, the flu, ear infections, dental work and i’ve gotten docked for everything when i literally can’t help it. A coworker of mine was logged on for 15 mins after their shift because they were on a call and they got accused of stealing company time. Have to click your mouse every 30 seconds or you’ll get docked for that. All you do is get screamed at by angry customers because their case managers don’t work in a timely fashion because how overworked they are. Also don’t try to call them because they don’t answer and are probably not even logged in because they seem to get unlimited pto and sick time unlike us!! THEY TREAT US LIKE THE CRUD OF THE OCEAN.

Company changes disability approval process every 4 months. They got rid of The nurses so you are now making decisions independently. Managers don't care about case managers only about how you make them look to their supervisors in huddle. Do NOT clear all your task. your manager will reassign claims from months ago (untouched claim, unreliable information). in my opinion my manager has too much vacation time. Being a case manager in the group insurance division is very stressful. As a case manager, you handle both the short term disability pay and the FMLA. The assigned case load is extremely high and it’s also an inbound call center. There is never enough time in the day. The work is constant with absolutely no downtime. Very little overtime is offered and when it is, it’s to do other people’s work and not your own. It’s a struggle to keep your head above water every day to even barely meet the requirements metrics. Your experience depends on the department you are in and your position.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Fisher-Investments-Reviews-E38954.htm,"I've been at FI for a decade and worked at a variety of other places in the industry for a decade before that. Fisher is by far the best place I've ever worked. FI has a mission driven culture to help clients succeed, while also investing in employees. In just a few years, you'll get opportunities to learn, do different things and develop skillsets you wouldn't get in an entire career somewhere else. I've seen countless people grow, do different things, and continue to rise up the ranks here. FI is very much a meritocracy—you are in control of your own destiny. Senior Management listens and acts on employee feedback—not always at the speed people demand, but the effort is there. Fisher isn't perfect (nowhere is), but it is as close as you can get in this industry. Don't believe me? Go ask the thousands of people getting laid off elsewhere in this industry right now. In reviewing Fisher Investments, I think about how much they've changed my life since starting here. The firm has provided me with valuable training on how the financial industry works, has provided opportunities to grow my skills in a wide range of areas, rewarded me in terms of both salary and benefits, and helped me meet an incredible network of people. The benefits - in particular - are something that set Fisher Investments apart. Every year when I review my options, there seem to be more to take advantage of. Their contributions towards these (100% for standard medical/vision/dental) and the amazing 401k match have helped me get ahead in a way my previous jobs never did. I’ve been with Fisher investments since 2014, started as a broker at Merrill lynch out of college - moving here was the best personal and professional decision I ever made. I love the service we offer, love the people I work with, and I can pickup the phone and call anyone at the firm I need to in order to get something done to serve our clients. No other firm in financial services can offer that. The first thing I would say is I love working for Fisher. I will never work anywhere else. The owner Ken Fisher had a clear vision that the everyday investor deserves ""better money management"" and that is built into the culture and values of the firm. As someone who has worked on both sides of the industry, broker vs advisor, I can tell you that you will love working here if you are coming from another money manager. Fisher believes in work life balance, diversity and providing opportunities from within. Most of Senior Management including the CEO has worked their whole lives at Fisher. If you are passionate about helping people, love working in a team environment and want to work hard this place is for you. This is a company that you will feel great going to sleep knowing that you clients' will be well taken care of with the active management showing long term results, an Investment Policy Committee and Research team with extensive training on portfolio management, transparent fee only schedule for the clients, frequent meetings to service clients' with much needed updates on. market and portfolio changes, and comprehensive financial, estate, and tax planning services. Fisher Investments has the BEST Comp Plan, healthcare package, 401k, and company perks than any company I have heard or seen provide. The culture here between the advisors is very inviting and willing to help share their process and success. The lead flow is ample for every advisor. The company prides itself on individual growth within the firm. Their are many employees with more than 20 years of tenure. Having been in the investment management business for decades and part of other great firms I can honestly say Fisher has built a culture that allows great teamwork with a singular focus on the client. The firm treats its employees the best I have ever seen. It is a true meritocracy and allows for personal and professional growth while being yourself. The benefits are outstanding, management is very capable and mentoring, and the ability to cross train and move positions within the company truly allows a lifelong career vs just a job. They got it right at Fisher. Their system is not broken. Hard work is rewarded and promotions are real. Fisher is a true meritocracy with an intense focus on the client in all aspects. If you are not client focused and work hard you will not like it. I've spent over a decade with Fisher Investments in a handful of client facing and managerial roles. -Focused on doing what's best for the client, every step of the way -Leadership leads by example and is focused on doing the right thing for clients -World class service, investment management and research -Dedicated team with subject matter experts at each step of the process -Full scope financial planning for all clients of the firms -Privately held, focused on employee development and client bettering -Outstanding total rewards, compensation and benefits Fisher Investments is an employer that cares as much for employees as it does clients! - Certified Great Place to Work - Award winning training and development - Benefits are extraordinary and show that FI is truly invested in keeping employees over time to build value exponentially as a win/win for the firm, clients, and the workplace culture/community. - Promotes from within, management facilitates your interest in other positions over time or tailored training and development. It's great for a long term career. Fisher's workplace is vibrant and open - there's a healthy sense of community, mentorship, and ""team"" atmosphere, rather than isolated cubicle culture. As an investment company helping clients manage their retirement, I've always felt implicitly confident that the firm puts the client first. As someone helping brand new clients for over a decade, I've never had any guilt in bringing a a new client on, because I know the firm's decision makers are highly and experienced, plus we're going to make sure they're comfortable by providing a level of high-touch service rarely found in the financial industry. Many of my friends that work at other big name brokerage firms, or small RIAs wear a lot of hats (sales, service, research & management) and feel a lot of pressure from their managers to push certain products (annuities, mutual funds, etc.) ...but that's never the case here. My role in private client acquisition with Fisher is simple: Help people that want/need help, and make sure we are a good fit for each other. If someone's not a good fit, that's okay. Fisher's a massive company and has been around for 40+ years. There are endless prospective clients to meet with, and a lot of people who would benefit from hiring a professional like Fisher for their management and financial planning. They haven't invented yet a system to force you to stay in the company forever and therefore you can resign.I've been at FI for a decade and worked at a variety of other places in the industry for a decade before that.

The firm has provided me with valuable training on how the financial industry works, has provided opportunities to grow my skills in a wide range of areas, rewarded me in terms of both salary and benefits, and helped me meet an incredible network of people. The benefits - in particular - are something that set Fisher Investments apart. Every year when I review my options, there seem to be more to take advantage of. Their contributions towards these (100% for standard medical/vision/dental) and the amazing 401k match have helped me get ahead in a way my previous jobs never did. I’ve been with Fisher investments since 2014, started as a broker at Merrill lynch out of college - moving here was the best personal and professional decision I ever made. I love the service we offer, love the people I work with, and I can pickup the phone and call anyone at the firm I need to in order to get something done to serve our clients. No other firm in financial services can offer that. The first thing I would say is I love working for Fisher. I will never work anywhere else. The owner Ken Fisher had a clear vision that the everyday investor deserves ""better money management"" and that is built into the culture and values of the firm. As someone who has worked on both sides of the industry, broker vs advisor, I can tell you that you will love working here if you are coming from another money manager. Fisher believes in work life balance, diversity and providing opportunities from within. Most of Senior Management including the CEO has worked their whole lives at Fisher. If you are passionate about helping people, love working in a team environment and want to work hard this place is for you. This is a company that you will feel great going to sleep knowing that you clients' will be well taken care of with the active management showing long term results, an Investment Policy Committee and Research team with extensive training on portfolio management, transparent fee only schedule for the clients, frequent meetings to service clients' with much needed updates on. market and portfolio changes, and comprehensive financial, estate, and tax planning services. Fisher Investments has the BEST Comp Plan, healthcare package, 401k, and company perks than any company I have heard or seen provide. The culture here between the advisors is very inviting and willing to help share their process and success. The lead flow is ample for every advisor. The company prides itself on individual growth within the firm. Their are many employees with more than 20 years of tenure. Having been in the investment management business for decades and part of other great firms I can honestly say Fisher has built a culture that allows great teamwork with a singular focus on the client. The firm treats its employees the best I have ever seen. It is a true meritocracy and allows for personal and professional growth while being yourself. The benefits are outstanding, management is very capable and mentoring, and the ability to cross train and move positions within the company truly allows a lifelong career vs just a job. They got it right at Fisher. Their system is not broken. Hard work is rewarded and promotions are real. Fisher is a true meritocracy with an intense focus on the client in all aspects. If you are not client focused and work hard you will not like it. I've spent over a decade with Fisher Investments in a handful of client facing and managerial roles. -Focused on doing what's best for the client, every step of the way -Leadership leads by example and is focused on doing the right thing for clients -World class service, investment management and research -Dedicated team with subject matter experts at each step of the process -Full scope financial planning for all clients of the firms -Privately held, focused on employee development and client bettering -Outstanding total rewards, compensation and benefits Fisher Investments is an employer that cares as much for employees as it does clients! - Certified Great Place to Work - Award winning training and development - Benefits are extraordinary and show that FI is truly invested in keeping employees over time to build value exponentially as a win/win for the firm, clients, and the workplace culture/community. - Promotes from within, management facilitates your interest in other positions over time or tailored training and development. It's great for a long term career. Fisher's workplace is vibrant and open - there's a healthy sense of community, mentorship, and ""team"" atmosphere, rather than isolated cubicle culture. As an investment company helping clients manage their retirement, I've always felt implicitly confident that the firm puts the client first. As someone helping brand new clients for over a decade, I've never had any guilt in bringing a a new client on, because I know the firm's decision makers are highly and experienced, plus we're going to make sure they're comfortable by providing a level of high-touch service rarely found in the financial industry. Many of my friends that work at other big name brokerage firms, or small RIAs wear a lot of hats (sales, service, research & management) and feel a lot of pressure from their managers to push certain products (annuities, mutual funds, etc.) ...but that's never the case here. My role in private client acquisition with Fisher is simple: Help people that want/need help, and make sure we are a good fit for each other. If someone's not a good fit, that's okay. Fisher's a massive company and has been around for 40+ years. There are endless prospective clients to meet with, and a lot of people who would benefit from hiring a professional like Fisher for their management and financial planning. They haven't invented yet a system to force you to stay in the company forever and therefore you can resign.I've been at FI for a decade and worked at a variety of other places in the industry for a decade before that. Fisher is by far the best place I've ever worked. FI has a mission driven culture to help clients succeed, while also investing in employees. In just a few years, you'll get opportunities to learn, do different things and develop skillsets you wouldn't get in an entire career somewhere else. I've seen countless people grow, do different things, and continue to rise up the ranks here. FI is very much a meritocracy—you are in control of your own destiny. Senior Management listens and acts on employee feedback—not always at the speed people demand, but the effort is there.

I've spent over a decade with Fisher Investments in a handful of client facing and managerial roles. -Focused on doing what's best for the client, every step of the way -Leadership leads by example and is focused on doing the right thing for clients -World class service, investment management and research -Dedicated team with subject matter experts at each step of the process -Full scope financial planning for all clients of the firms -Privately held, focused on employee development and client bettering -Outstanding total rewards, compensation and benefits Fisher Investments is an employer that cares as much for employees as it does clients! - Certified Great Place to Work - Award winning training and development - Benefits are extraordinary and show that FI is truly invested in keeping employees over time to build value exponentially as a win/win for the firm, clients, and the workplace culture/community. - Promotes from within, management facilitates your interest in other positions over time or tailored training and development. It's great for a long term career. Fisher's workplace is vibrant and open - there's a healthy sense of community, mentorship, and ""team"" atmosphere, rather than isolated cubicle culture. As an investment company helping clients manage their retirement, I've always felt implicitly confident that the firm puts the client first. As someone helping brand new clients for over a decade, I've never had any guilt in bringing a a new client on, because I know the firm's decision makers are highly and experienced, plus we're going to make sure they're comfortable by providing a level of high-touch service rarely found in the financial industry. Many of my friends that work at other big name brokerage firms, or small RIAs wear a lot of hats (sales, service, research & management) and feel a lot of pressure from their managers to push certain products (annuities, mutual funds, etc.) ...but that's never the case here. My role in private client acquisition with Fisher is simple: Help people that want/need help, and make sure we are a good fit for each other. If someone's not a good fit, that's okay. Fisher's a massive company and has been around for 40+ years. There are endless prospective clients to meet with, and a lot of people who would benefit from hiring a professional like Fisher for their management and financial planning. They haven't invented yet a system to force you to stay in the company forever and therefore you can resign.I've been at FI for a decade and worked at a variety of other places in the industry for a decade before that. Fisher is by far the best place I've ever worked. FI has a mission driven culture to help clients succeed, while also investing in employees. In just a few years, you'll get opportunities to learn, do different things and develop skillsets you wouldn't get in an entire career somewhere else. I've seen countless people grow, do different things, and continue to rise up the ranks here. FI is very much a meritocracy—you are in control of your own destiny. Senior Management listens and acts on employee feedback—not always at the speed people demand, but the effort is there. Fisher isn't perfect (nowhere is), but it is as close as you can get in this industry. Don't believe me? Go ask the thousands of people getting laid off elsewhere in this industry right now. In reviewing Fisher Investments, I think about how much they've changed my life since starting here. The firm has provided me with valuable training on how the financial industry works, has provided opportunities to grow my skills in a wide range of areas, rewarded me in terms of both salary and benefits, and helped me meet an incredible network of people. The benefits - in particular - are something that set Fisher Investments apart. Every year when I review my options, there seem to be more to take advantage of. Their contributions towards these (100% for standard medical/vision/dental) and the amazing 401k match have helped me get ahead in a way my previous jobs never did. I’ve been with Fisher investments since 2014, started as a broker at Merrill lynch out of college - moving here was the best personal and professional decision I ever made. I love the service we offer, love the people I work with, and I can pickup the phone and call anyone at the firm I need to in order to get something done to serve our clients. No other firm in financial services can offer that. The first thing I would say is I love working for Fisher. I will never work anywhere else. The owner Ken Fisher had a clear vision that the everyday investor deserves ""better money management"" and that is built into the culture and values of the firm. As someone who has worked on both sides of the industry, broker vs advisor, I can tell you that you will love working here if you are coming from another money manager. Fisher believes in work life balance, diversity and providing opportunities from within. Most of Senior Management including the CEO has worked their whole lives at Fisher. If you are passionate about helping people, love working in a team environment and want to work hard this place is for you. This is a company that you will feel great going to sleep knowing that you clients' will be well taken care of with the active management showing long term results, an Investment Policy Committee and Research team with extensive training on portfolio management, transparent fee only schedule for the clients, frequent meetings to service clients' with much needed updates on. market and portfolio changes, and comprehensive financial, estate, and tax planning services. Fisher Investments has the BEST Comp Plan, healthcare package, 401k, and company perks than any company I have heard or seen provide. The culture here between the advisors is very inviting and willing to help share their process and success. The lead flow is ample for every advisor. The company prides itself on individual growth within the firm. Their are many employees with more than 20 years of tenure. Having been in the investment management business for decades and part of other great firms I can honestly say Fisher has built a culture that allows great teamwork with a singular focus on the client. The firm treats its employees the best I have ever seen. It is a true meritocracy and allows for personal and professional growth while being yourself. The benefits are outstanding, management is very capable and mentoring, and the ability to cross train and move positions within the company truly allows a lifelong career vs just a job. They got it right at Fisher. Their system is not broken. Hard work is rewarded and promotions are real. Fisher is a true meritocracy with an intense focus on the client in all aspects.

I don’t have any personally otherwise I would fix them or leave. We offer really great service for our clients and we expect a lot from our employees to do that. We also offer lots of opportunities to brand new college graduates and not everyone is up to the task. It's competitive. You will be working with individuals who are very good at what they do and very driven knowing Fisher has opportunities in management as well as moving to other departments. Therefor you better come to work and treat coworkers with respect while doing it. It's not easy to get in the door without having to move unless you are in the Tampa, Dallas, or Portland areas. Fisher treats you as an adult and has high expectations in return. If you are not willing to be highly client focused and work hard with very visible but attainable goals it is not the right fit. This is not a place where you can treat as a job vs career. They treat you as a long term career employee and expect that work ethic in return. Would like to see more opportunities for employee ownership/equity to allows those supporting the business to participate in the firms growth firsthand. FI is currently exploring hybrid work options and while more teams would like to see these implemented, we know that leadership is hard at work to see how this feature can evolve in the best way. The expectations for activity are high, but this is a fast-paced industry. This should be expected. This is a call canter and there is any chance to give tailor made and personalized service. The only think they want is to call as many clients as possible and ask them money. Everything is monitored: how many calls are you doing and what are you telling to the clients, you are not even able to send an email to a client without being authorized. Zero flexibility starting from what can you say to the client (just what they want and how they want) to the working time and the WFH which is consider like Sterling money from the company. Every day you will be braimwashed with slogan like ""help families"" or ""keep smiling when you call the clients!!!!"" Or ""Fisher is listening our conversations"" Last but not least thebmanagement is the worst I have ever seen because they are chosing the most loyal not the most prepared. They are obsessed by the control and the only thing they are able to do is a terribile micromanagement."

Having multiple streams of cash flow every month is helpful for marketing and growing my business. I also enjoy the financial security of knowing that I am building a retirement while simply selling homes and talking to agents. The company also has strong financials and zero debt which is comforting in a shifting market. - Stock programs for every commission made, we get 10% discount to buy stock from what is taken out -eXp World is the best customer service along with great networking to develop through virtual interaction - More affordable compared to other companies - Programs offered to newer agents - Better commission split between agent and broker (30/70) - Stock gained for recruiting agents to eXp Working from home is convenient. They are flexible with your hours if you need to take off for an appointment you don’t have to use PTO, you can make up your time throughout the week. This is a cutting edge cloud brokerage with every resource and very little to zero tittle tattle and office politics. Every deal is the same for every agent unless that agent is on a team. I think it is great. Everybody is willing to help you succeed. Can receive that team help without being on a team. Great Commission Split, Revenue Share, and stock options. Better training than KW. You get trained by top producers + get a mentor if you are a new agent. Surprising buzz and company culture- I have been surprised at the excitement at eXp Realty along with the connectivity between agents. 100% Cloud-based means access to brokers and accounting is seamless","If I HAD to name one thing it would be that the hiring process can take a little long, it took about 7 weeks from applying to start date but that might be normal! You need to be competitive to stand out If you need an office to regularly see your colleagues it might be a transition but I have worked in many RE/MAX offices and most Agents work at home anyway. eXp provides a membership in Regus shared workspaces and they are located worldwide so you can always pop in and work in a beautiful staffed office. Bonus you may get a lead from another business person working in there. Everyone is overworked and under appreciated. The company is severely understaffed after mass layoffs, and their answer is outsourcing jobs to the Philippines where they pay $5/ hour instead of $25. They sacrifice quality employees for cheap labor and the quality of work has suffered. Agents are angry and the blame is placed on the state broker team because they are the face of eXp for their respective states. They will literally except any agent to boost their numbers, even if the agent has been fired from every other brokerage they’ve worked at. They have zero regard for real estate law. If an agent complains about something, the agent gets what they want. There is literally a “No Buster Hotline” agents can call to complain if someone tells them no, and the broker team gets a call from leadership telling them “Let’s get to yes.” They make so many “exceptions” to their policies and procedures that the lines have become blurry and it’s difficult to keep up with who is held to certain standards and who isn’t. It all depends on who you know! You MUST plug in and get involved to get the many benefits. Agents who linger on the sidelines and do NOT attend the trainings and events and do not implement the systems, will NOT get the benefits. Agents are independent contractors which means they are their own boss. The problem is that they are their own boss......and own worst enemy at times. If you need micromanaged, you may want to join one of the many teams within EXP. - Not much tools available for newer agents - Mentorship program only lasts a couple of transactions - Have to join a real estate team to have connections to subs. This company is so disorganized it is astonishing. Upper management is incapable of making a decision and following through. It is a hostile work environment in the TEXAS region. It is not about knowledge it's about bending over for management. Training is non-existent for staff and it's learn as you go. Occasionally, I miss the office, but we have great parties. The current housing market affecting both buyers and sellers It took about a month to be paired with a mentor (I'm a new agent). Now that I have a mentor, she has been great.

Great staff!","the over night shift for me personally, may not be a problem for another. Structure needs some rebuilding, they need a better training program for managers and staff, hell if they would just follow what corporate outlined they would probably be ok, but they cut training that should take a few days into 1 day, and most managers barely go through 1 to 3 weeks if that before they are turned lose. All because they will lose money on training labor. You work a ridgid schedule with no real availability to request a day off, work every holiday. The untrained managers do not know how to do their jobs nothing is ever done to correct the issue when they do not do their jobs, so most of the work weight is left on a single person for a 24 hr restaurant. This company has GMs that don't know how to do their job so the area managers are left running like crazy to help go to their stores and do or check the truck orders, inventory, payroll, end of week and month paperwork etc. I have seen so much dishonesty and lack of integrity from this company, this is barely the tip of the iceberg. After clocking out you would have a distinct smell that was noticeable to other people Equipment never worked correctly, Upper management didn't have a clue (DM, RM), couldn't keep good employees because of the crappy employees and enormous turn over rare 24 hour round the clock availability slow at times and shifts aren't always balanced Pay is terrible for the amount of work provided by each employee. Too much sidework and deep cleaning. Not enough training. No help. Managers suck and rotated out more than you change your underwear. Like any other place you work at, you can find some great people to work with. But it’s mostly crap!! Not a very stable salary Not many staff at night, management, no proper trainingthe over night shift for me personally, may not be a problem for another.

After clocking out you would have a distinct smell that was noticeable to other people slow at times and shifts aren't always balanced Structure needs some rebuilding, they need a better training program for managers and staff, hell if they would just follow what corporate outlined they would probably be ok, but they cut training that should take a few days into 1 day, and most managers barely go through 1 to 3 weeks if that before they are turned lose. All because they will lose money on training labor. You work a ridgid schedule with no real availability to request a day off, work every holiday. The untrained managers do not know how to do their jobs nothing is ever done to correct the issue when they do not do their jobs, so most of the work weight is left on a single person for a 24 hr restaurant. This company has GMs that don't know how to do their job so the area managers are left running like crazy to help go to their stores and do or check the truck orders, inventory, payroll, end of week and month paperwork etc. I have seen so much dishonesty and lack of integrity from this company, this is barely the tip of the iceberg. Not a very stable salary Equipment never worked correctly, Upper management didn't have a clue (DM, RM), couldn't keep good employees because of the crappy employees and enormous turn over rare 24 hour round the clock availability Pay is terrible for the amount of work provided by each employee. Too much sidework and deep cleaning. Not enough training. You have to be able to budget and save your money. It can be difi ult when you are not getting paud all your money at once through a paycheck. Bar rush with the drunks was roughthe over night shift for me personally, may not be a problem for another.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Aveanna-Healthcare-Reviews-E1820653.htm,"there is no better reward then putting a smile on someones face just simply for being there. Fair pay Decent benefits Good culture Good for inexperienced individuals seeking business experience in healthcare. Understanding, compassionate, generous, wants you to succeed and thrive, wants you to be the best you can, pushes you to make sure you’re doing your best, shows gratitude… They are my family. This company has great employee support! They genuinely care about their employees! RN supervisors are easy to communicate with and get the patients and nurses everything that is needed to care for our patients! The benefits are reasonably priced and our schedules are flexible to accommodate our busy lives! I’ve been with this company almost 2 years,and I can say I have been treated better than any other employer since entering nursing in 2004! Caring for children with disablities and complex needs There’s always a case to work with Aveanna. The hiring process is quick and seamless. Staff is pleasant and supportive. Pros: - Management actually cares about you and sees you as more than an easily replaceable body filling a role - You’re given the resources to do your job well - You’re actually encouraged to have work-life balance. The “hustle culture” leads to burnout and managers actively try to not reinforce working beyond your capacity. This work is so very rewarding personally. It is always a blessing to be able to serve others in our community. I feel that our staff is more of a family than coworkers and we try to hold each other up when they are having a difficult patient situation. You are always guaranteed to find at least 2 people that are willing to jump in and help you Working independently is great. Must learn to adapt to their lifestyle and be accepting of their cultural rituals. Tablet charting is fairly easy, required to doc every 2 hrs. The peds patients are a joy to work with, careful to not get too attached. You get to see a lot of multi complex diagnoses. Seeing pt positively progressing is very rewarding and satisfying. Scheduling staffers do a good job to accommodate the hours that you are available to work. You choose what location is convenient and affordable for the drive. Training done by supervisor is fairly decent. RT rocks! Does a nice job demonstrating vent care/ duties. RT is always available and supportive via phone for any questions. Annual Skill Fair is nice to go to for a refresher and to meet up with other field nurses.there is no better reward then putting a smile on someones face just simply for being there.

Unappreciative bosses and patient families Poor pay- unlivable in modern-day CT. More importantly, if you choose Aveanna, I would definitely recommend against this specific location due to the culture. At least during my time there, they were significantly lacking professionally and personally. I was insulted and bullied constantly for things that were out of my control or even parts of my identity (gender, for ex.) To me, this office resembled a group of teenage girls in terms of overall professionalism and character: Frequent cussing, lack of respect for others not in the main 'clique', maturity issues, and not using proper language even with visitors/candidates in office. I wasn't here quite long and left abruptly, but even after my first month I was never fully taught all of my job responsibilities (even after asking several times) because management did not want to take the time to teach me. I was then ridiculed for not knowing how to handle said tasks. On multiple occasions, I overheard or saw rude comments about myself from coworkers. They would also lock themselves in an individual's office and gossip about you/others, although they had no problem doing this to your face at the desks either. This was also frustrating because you could be frequently left alone in the center area to handle all incoming calls and requests while they took their time having personal conversations. I would include more, but I do not wish to overly speak negatively upon the company. I left for different reasons than the environment, but even if I stayed in this industry I would not continue to work here due to this. I honestly can’t think of anything, there’s a lot you can expect and want from a office staff and I think we honestly have it and I feel that has come from and been generated all from the Area Director that we have that was once our Location Director, and before that our DON, CCM, down to field nurse. I started with this company when it was PSA Healthcare as a temp 10 years ago and it was just her and I in the office to begin with and I would never ask for a better role model of a supervisor or person to follow I would like to be able to have more pto time to make up for when my patient is ill in the hospital and I cannot go to work. Communication lack of professional ism Fort Lauderdale Local Director is unpleasant. Hard around the edges. Doesn’t respond to calls. If you’re a perfectionist, get used to being “average.” Company’s expectation is for you to exceed expectations - but again, they do give you the resources to help you do just that. Our coverage area recently expanded and there is no cell service in some of the areas which is fine during the day but I do not feel safe when driving through there on call in the night. When you take a day off it puts you behind for the rest of the week and it feels like you should have not taken the day off Some families can be annoying, depends if the assignment has a helicopter mom/caregiver. It can make you or break you. Some houses are very filthy, unacceptable when a sick child needs a clean environment and an area to keep sterile/ clean technique. It can be very uncomfortable to work in such disgusting conditions. Respectfully and continuously educating on proper hygiene and proper disinfection to family is a waste of time. Some families have the worst habits/won't change and it makes you cringe. Some family members are not Covid vaxed either. When they are sick they don't wear a mask around patients. You can advocate & protect your patient as hard as you can but you are STILL in their house. So be careful what you say. Supervisor is alerted and often times is very laid back, hardly resolves the concern/problem. Communication with supervisor is okay. There is no yearly pay increase. New hired nurses are getting paid more than seasoned nurses, unfair. The company tells you not to share your pay rate with other nurses. Big red flag! That means there is no transparency with your employees, they only care about profit. Medicaid paperwork clearly states what they can pay a nurse ($40 range/hr) but the company won't.there are no cons working here!
