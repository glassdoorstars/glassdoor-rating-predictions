I personally question the ethical conduct and effectiveness of University Human Resources. Intimidation, deception, indifference, and unprofessional behavior have been observed or reported. If you want to work at Iowa State, vet your employer carefully and avoid HR at all costs.

They'll preach safety but they don't really care. If you are a single guy with not a lot of friends or family or they just don't care if they don't see you often, then this is a good spot. If you want to go out on the weekends and see friends and family and have a solid 2 days of enjoying your life, then don't apply. This place doesn't care about you, only your hands and only if those hands are starting a machine button. Bureaucracy To many layers of management No work life balance work at a lot of 12s and Saturday - loud - laborious work Management needs skills on how to treat people with respect. All they want to do is make boxes no matter the cost in personal relationship."

Working at Avaya is like having an abusive boyfriend - you know you should leave, they keep promising to change, and then they beat you up again. Senior leadership is extremely unpredictable, changes strategy at the drop of a hat, and then blames employees and lays a bunch of people off when their decisions have led them into bankruptcy...twice. No 401k match. It's been promised to us that it will return soon. Mental and emotional damage Long hours, they make you work after your business hours because of overseas resources time difference, and also because after hours is when cut overs happen. Worst working experience and environment. Conflicting messages on DPTW. The CEO made a lot of noise on turning Avaya into a Destination Place To Work, but at the same time was taking steps to slash the workforce. I found that to be disingenuous as most employees were constantly looking over their shoulders, afraid of the next round layoffs. That has left most employees with a trust issue with the CEO. They will emerge from bankruptcy, but how much damage will have been done to the trust relationships Avaya has with their customers. Antiquated culture - might as well be the 80s in there. Very old workforce with no younger people or cross-training or innovation. CEOs and upper management have no clue how to keep up with competitors or manage company finances/debt. They've gone into bankruptcy twice while upper execs walk away with golden parachutes. Multiple promotions with the promise of a raise, but no actual raise after 3 years of verbal promises. Bosses and leadership are very out of touch with reality. They expect employees to pull off insane projects with zero resources and absolutely no regard for the work that actually has to be done, so expecting perfect execution inside of a month for a 6-month project that requires 2-3x the planned budget. Was laid off the day after labor day with 1 month's pay as payment for 8 years of service. They don't care at all about employees or their development or happiness. Financial status and layoffs it’s very unstable Aggressive restructuring and 'job actions' Strong focus on 'destination place to work' means concentrating remaining US workers at Avaya locations--de-emphasis on remote work Aggressive offshore sourcing Different organizations don't team well. Very little growth opportunities, constant changes, benefits could be improved.Shift in management and changing developments constantly I was with Avaya for many years, and once I left, I finally realized what a healthy company culture SHOULD look like.

Very little growth opportunities, constant changes, benefits could be improved.Shift in management and changing developments constantly I was with Avaya for many years, and once I left, I finally realized what a healthy company culture SHOULD look like. Working at Avaya is like having an abusive boyfriend - you know you should leave, they keep promising to change, and then they beat you up again. Senior leadership is extremely unpredictable, changes strategy at the drop of a hat, and then blames employees and lays a bunch of people off when their decisions have led them into bankruptcy...twice. No 401k match. It's been promised to us that it will return soon. Mental and emotional damage Long hours, they make you work after your business hours because of overseas resources time difference, and also because after hours is when cut overs happen. Worst working experience and environment. Conflicting messages on DPTW. The CEO made a lot of noise on turning Avaya into a Destination Place To Work, but at the same time was taking steps to slash the workforce. I found that to be disingenuous as most employees were constantly looking over their shoulders, afraid of the next round layoffs. That has left most employees with a trust issue with the CEO. They will emerge from bankruptcy, but how much damage will have been done to the trust relationships Avaya has with their customers. Antiquated culture - might as well be the 80s in there. Very old workforce with no younger people or cross-training or innovation. CEOs and upper management have no clue how to keep up with competitors or manage company finances/debt. They've gone into bankruptcy twice while upper execs walk away with golden parachutes. Multiple promotions with the promise of a raise, but no actual raise after 3 years of verbal promises. Bosses and leadership are very out of touch with reality.

Getting stuff done 2. Everyday is a challenge Space industry is growing at the moment and KSC needs engineering support with ground support equipment, and customers seek support with problems with their satellites and rockets. job security, benefits, work opportunities During break they had amazing donuts! -There is a wide variety of interesting and unique projects to work on -Relaxed atmosphere -Nice co-workers","Awesome environment to be working at far away from my house Didnt go to mars for a bit Bagels seemed to not be enough I have no cons for working at NASA. 1. A lot of workers are lazy Much of the work can be hands-off, such as certification work for flight readiness. Pay has fallen behind what the industry offers engineers, even after adding in benefits, when compared to the working level (GS-13). And there tends to be a bottleneck trying to get promoted to GS-14, but then seems to ease a bit for those that get above that. Unfortunately, OPM defines the pay and engineering is lumped in with all other professions across the government, so your pay is bound to other lagging fields of work. A bit far to drive from home to office. I have to leave my family and occupy all my time to this company. -Government pay -There are definitely some smart people, but let's be honest, most people here do not strive to be exceptional, in part because it's nearly impossible to get fired. -Massive incompetence in management - both from a technical standpoint and a human interface standpoint. -Exceptional achievement *might* get you an award but nothing else (e.g. no bonus)"

However, that would go for most MNCs. They market safety standards then coerce employees to break them under the table. They promised work for 4 years and lost the contract in months. The reasons they failed and had to let go of people in Vegas is purely because management always sweeping all the dozens of issues and improvements the people on the field would see and try to prevent. They use subsidiary companies that are theirs as fall guys, and it is with that neglectful business practice that they cause a sense of forgotten step-child atmosphere to whole markets and industries they run. They have a lack of base training or people skills that causes foreman and super intendants to only know either how to lead or how to work, not both. They outwardly promote workmanship and advertise care and safety however always set deadlines that could not be met with the quality of tools provided. Then when you are working with 20 year old hand me downs 300ft in the air and the barest equipment needed to get the job done they blame it on the leads, tower hands and green-hands?
