Absolutely love the team and the people and culture at Iron Mountain. If you are looking for a great place to work, when people respect each other, they value their team members and appreciate talent. This is the place for you. The senior mgmt clearly communicates throughout the organization, there is a sense of camaraderie and belonging for all employees. It has a diverse group of people from around the world and everyone's opinions matter at Iron Mountain. I feel like you can get heard and everyone is fighting to win customers - working towards presenting our best foot forward. Customer comes first and I love that everyone's always working to make this a better place to work. I was recruited to join Iron Mountain a year ago. When first contacted I thought, ""the shredding company?"" which is a common misperception. Iron Mountain is so much more. Our Matterhorn growth and transformation story is awe-inspiring and to be able to be even one sentence of one page of one chapter of that growth story makes me feel like I'm having an immense impact. Not to mention the Head of Executive Search and the Head of Talent Acquisition are 2 of the best bosses I've had in my 20+ year career. They really know the industry and the talent function, and have the patience to impart what they know in a meaningful and resonant way. I am beyond blessed to have joined such a great team and am delighted to be able to help recruit some of the best and brightest executives to join our climb. Autonomous Good money Remote Local transportation leadership is wonderful During interview process, seemed very open to embracing new leader with new perspective, previous experience, expertise and success.

Taking credit for other's ideas and presenting as their own, sabotaging initiatives, false accusations, inappropriate accusations, falsifications of performance metrics were a constant with certain leaders but not addressed, empowering continued unethical behavior and actions. *Pay increases and bonuses can be very political/less performance-based: I've encountered 10+ individuals from 3 different divisions offer this or similar unsolicited comment to me, personally, and have countless others say this is the case generally. There is a lot of chatter around annual awards time...frequently encounter these discussions on a yearly basis. Few permanent positions with my assignment They work you to death and send jobs overseas. The only people you see giving a good review is management and above. Ask yourself why. They are probably getting paid to do so. They don't care about their employees at all. When I first started there were jobs all over the US and Canada. Year after year jobs went overseas till now there is hardly any jobs except in a center they bought that use to be another companies. I guarantee they will lose their jobs soon enough. CEO only cares about making his millions. He has ruined this company by buying out other companies to gain the monopoly. As an employee they literally work you to death and will keep adding more and more work. Companies including some very large companies are ending contracts because of the fact that they must deal with overseas sweatshops. Stay far away from this company trust me. Large company so hard to find the right team / person Some enterprise teams are short staffed so slow on performance Lots of paperwork and steps to get anything moving in the system Put on scanner. Equipment malfunctions. Other scanners take easiest boxes to do and were managers favorites, especially any women. Taken off scanner as if it my fault. Process documents. Moved from one team to another. So called ""managers"" in charge of teams wanted work done fast and so many did lousy jobs and work not checked. I took my time to make sure it was done correctly and they just let me go. No warning, NOTHING. So much for caring. Never again."

Initially, the recruiter will sell you a dream…about how great the company is and how they promote moving up on the company and they pair you with a Director that will really help you….LIES !! As soon as you come in you will be tasked with work that makes absolutely no sense and you are expected to pull it out of no where, with no guidance, no assistance, nothing! They do little to help you especially if you are of color even though they voice inclusion… LIES! This company has such a high turn over rate it’s ridiculous. There was one occasion where the Director actually drove to an employees house to get their laptop because they took another position with the customer. Just completely unprofessional! Left the employee in tears (he should have called the police) If you value your life and your peace you can find something better. I was under so much stress I lost weight and had terrible stomach cramps that went away the moment my position ended. The money was not worth the stress. Feels like too much red tape and onboarding was horrendous. You can't get the equipment you need to get your job done appropriately. To even get a notebook or pens, you have to either go to an office (which is too far for me) or have to try and request it. My previous firm I came from, you just went out and bought it and just expensed it. If you are working from home and ask for a simple mouse, you can't get one. You can tell this place is PE owned, as they are trying to be very stingy on expenses. Overall, I felt that for onboarding you are on your own to learn things. No one went over the performance review process, how to update your staffing time, expense entry, etc. You're just given a checklist to complete. Onboarding was definitely focused on the public/government sector and being on the commercial side, I just felt like an after-thought. I imagine your experience with the company will depend on who they contract you out to. My on-site team was very busy and thus the ""unlimited PTO"" promise was just a way to NOT be able to take much PTO, and you are basically at the mercy of the approval of the onsite supervisor. You are also in this weird limbo, because the onsite supervisor has basically all the power over your duties and time, but are released from any issues that arise since they are not ""your boss"" and therefore don't have the power to really create any positive changes. Any changes usually mean heavy negotiations between the contractor and Guidehouse, which requires both the contractor and Guidehouse be willing to do so. Additionally there is not really a good ""raise"" or increased compensation policy, esp. since they claim they need to abide by the government raise caps,... so you kind of get the worst of both worlds. Finally, it seemed to be quite difficult to find a way to improve your situation, as their main goal is to keep the contractor happy, so again, if you have a high demand team there is really no incentive to help you get out from that team and find a better fitting role within Guidehouse, nor any backing to help you arrive to a better situation within the existing team. A lot of unknowns regarding growth Emphasis on billing Poor budget management Giving lower level employees (C1 C2) responsibilities of SC and MCs to save projects or programs money Every day at this company feels like a prison sentence. The pay is extremely bad and the benefits are somehow worse. The benefits are some of the worst I have ever seen or even heard of. Every month I hope that I'll somehow have enough money to pay all the bills. Raises are paltry. There are no promotions for underlings like me. I look everyday for new opportunities and I can only hope that this suffering will one day end. My job brings me no joy. It has made me a bitter and cynical person. Stay away, I wish I did. Can be a big workload at times There’s a huge snitching culture, disguised as “frequent 360 constructive feedback.” Every little mistake you make is noted by others on your team and oftentimes reported to your people manager or team manager. Performance standards are incredibly subjective and are written to serve that purpose - what could be considered good performance on one team can be considered bad performance at another. As such, some good people get drummed out while some bad people get glowing annual reviews. If you’re not meeting expectations, management has a “figure it out yourself” attitude that can leave employees confused, frustrated, and resigned to a PIP and eventual resignation/termination. Executive leadership is obsessed with acquisitions and the sellable value of the company at the expense of the welfare of their staff. The CEO in particular only seems to ever talk about projected firm value when speaking with staff, and it got irritating. Diversity at the executive level is practically nonexistent, and many teams consist entirely of white people with degrees from high-power universities. - Salary is extremely underwhelming compared to market competitors. - Leadership is awful. There is a disconnect between segment leadership and Guidehouse leadership as a whole. They are incredibly secretive. - Promotions and raises are based on popularity contests and favoritism. If you’re in the NY office, you’re fine. Anywhere else? There is no growth for you. - There is virtually no internal support or room for you to grow from lower levels. Review cycles are absolute jokes. You’re reviewed by people who have never worked closely with you, and these people have the most say over your performance. They act like there’s structure and the cycles are robust, but really it’s a bunch of people who don’t know you sitting in a room talking about your work, which they’ve also never really seen. You can build business cases - they won’t look at them. - Very strict on internal compliance but offer no support to navigate it. Have a time sheet question? No one has the answer, but they will continue to ding you for being out of compliance. - Benefits are awful. -Internal support services and operations are often inefficient -Often displays worst examples of behavior of a large corporation -DEIB is an afterthoughtNewer company with developing infrastructure Do yourself a favor and do not work for this company.

As soon as you come in you will be tasked with work that makes absolutely no sense and you are expected to pull it out of no where, with no guidance, no assistance, nothing! They do little to help you especially if you are of color even though they voice inclusion… LIES! This company has such a high turn over rate it’s ridiculous. There was one occasion where the Director actually drove to an employees house to get their laptop because they took another position with the customer. Just completely unprofessional!

I was under so much stress I lost weight and had terrible stomach cramps that went away the moment my position ended. The money was not worth the stress. Feels like too much red tape and onboarding was horrendous. You can't get the equipment you need to get your job done appropriately. To even get a notebook or pens, you have to either go to an office (which is too far for me) or have to try and request it. My previous firm I came from, you just went out and bought it and just expensed it. If you are working from home and ask for a simple mouse, you can't get one. You can tell this place is PE owned, as they are trying to be very stingy on expenses. Overall, I felt that for onboarding you are on your own to learn things. No one went over the performance review process, how to update your staffing time, expense entry, etc. You're just given a checklist to complete. Onboarding was definitely focused on the public/government sector and being on the commercial side, I just felt like an after-thought. Can be a big workload at times I imagine your experience with the company will depend on who they contract you out to. My on-site team was very busy and thus the ""unlimited PTO"" promise was just a way to NOT be able to take much PTO, and you are basically at the mercy of the approval of the onsite supervisor. You are also in this weird limbo, because the onsite supervisor has basically all the power over your duties and time, but are released from any issues that arise since they are not ""your boss"" and therefore don't have the power to really create any positive changes. Any changes usually mean heavy negotiations between the contractor and Guidehouse, which requires both the contractor and Guidehouse be willing to do so. Additionally there is not really a good ""raise"" or increased compensation policy, esp. since they claim they need to abide by the government raise caps,... so you kind of get the worst of both worlds. Finally, it seemed to be quite difficult to find a way to improve your situation, as their main goal is to keep the contractor happy, so again, if you have a high demand team there is really no incentive to help you get out from that team and find a better fitting role within Guidehouse, nor any backing to help you arrive to a better situation within the existing team. A lot of unknowns regarding growth Emphasis on billing Poor budget management Giving lower level employees (C1 C2) responsibilities of SC and MCs to save projects or programs money Consulting company with a high possibility of job loss depending on current contract. Not much to say it was great working here - Upward mobility is sluggish - Resistance to shifting consultants to new roles & supported organizations - Expectation to work after-hours internal grunt work projects to be considered for promotion or additional opportunities (client facing work felt like the necessary duty, but there were no rewards for doing it well) Every day at this company feels like a prison sentence. The pay is extremely bad and the benefits are somehow worse. The benefits are some of the worst I have ever seen or even heard of.

Can be a big workload at times There’s a huge snitching culture, disguised as “frequent 360 constructive feedback.” Every little mistake you make is noted by others on your team and oftentimes reported to your people manager or team manager. Performance standards are incredibly subjective and are written to serve that purpose - what could be considered good performance on one team can be considered bad performance at another. As such, some good people get drummed out while some bad people get glowing annual reviews. If you’re not meeting expectations, management has a “figure it out yourself” attitude that can leave employees confused, frustrated, and resigned to a PIP and eventual resignation/termination. Executive leadership is obsessed with acquisitions and the sellable value of the company at the expense of the welfare of their staff. The CEO in particular only seems to ever talk about projected firm value when speaking with staff, and it got irritating. Diversity at the executive level is practically nonexistent, and many teams consist entirely of white people with degrees from high-power universities. - Salary is extremely underwhelming compared to market competitors. - Leadership is awful. There is a disconnect between segment leadership and Guidehouse leadership as a whole. They are incredibly secretive. - Promotions and raises are based on popularity contests and favoritism. If you’re in the NY office, you’re fine. Anywhere else? There is no growth for you. - There is virtually no internal support or room for you to grow from lower levels. Review cycles are absolute jokes. You’re reviewed by people who have never worked closely with you, and these people have the most say over your performance. They act like there’s structure and the cycles are robust, but really it’s a bunch of people who don’t know you sitting in a room talking about your work, which they’ve also never really seen. You can build business cases - they won’t look at them. - Very strict on internal compliance but offer no support to navigate it. Have a time sheet question? No one has the answer, but they will continue to ding you for being out of compliance. - Benefits are awful. -Internal support services and operations are often inefficient -Often displays worst examples of behavior of a large corporation -DEIB is an afterthoughtNewer company with developing infrastructure Do yourself a favor and do not work for this company.

Generally nice colleagues Low pressure work environment","If I did, I would already be working for a career elsewhere. No employee referral process. No transparency. Pays way less than other competitors. 1. Outdated and non-transferable technical skills in Esri create a barrier to moving forward in your career. The commonly utilized tools and methods no longer contribute to my professional growth. Additionally, many of the skills held by senior engineers have limited value beyond this company. In many cases, they appear disconnected from the current industry trends and developments. 2. Having read the low-rated reviews prior to joining Esri and now experiencing it firsthand, I can confirm the reality. Establishing career progression indeed seems to be an extremely challenging task in Esri. I found the learning experience in this regard to be quite limited. In fact, I began to sense that I was gradually losing touch with the technical and adaptable skills I had acquired from my previous positions. 3. The duration of maternity/paternity leave provided by the company is terrible. 4. Subpar onboarding from team members - this might be team-specific. 5. Interacting with self-centered old-timer engineers is common in Esri. 6. The vesting period for the 401k is spread out over three years. 7. The company talks highly about its health insurance as if they provide something unparalleled. 8. Redlands: either you'll dislike it or find it appealing. The school district is good, the town is small, traffic within the city is manageable, and it's safe for families. However, it's bland, boring, and hot. If you are relocating to Redlands, do your research properly - I did not, and I'm regretting every moment of living here. One person's comment about its proximity to LA and OC seems a bit off. The reality is that it's about a 1.5-hour drive (without traffic) via the i91 freeway. This freeway is known for being one of the most terrible freeways in California. Finding apartments in Redlands can also be a bit of a challenge. Most of the new constructions are in the northern part of Redlands, and they tend to charge a higher price that might not align with what Redlands offers as a city. 9. It's funny how people in other reviews tend to compare Esri with companies like Apple or Google without really considering the differences in terms of benefits, growth opportunities, reputation, and investment in employee development that each company offers. * The politics and gatekeeping in Redlands is so blatant. * High performance isn't rewarded and growth can be stunted by gatekeepers * Old employees do not follow company values. I can't wait for them to leave. Lots of gatekeepers in Redlands, low pay. Culture differs from team to team, depending on manager. Promotions with small raise is common pay is not as competitive with other big tech 1.Atrocious raises and base pay. No matter your seniority, your raises will be in the lower single digits. HR and the team will always find every crooked excuse in the book to not pay you what you deserve. A lot of good talent has left the company in the last 2 years due to this very reason. (Over 30% of my team left in the last 1 year over salary and raises). 2. Upper management lives in a shell and does not understand current trends. If you speak up on behalf of you and your colleagues, management pretends to care but gaslights you anyway. 3.Weird WFH rules. Some of the team members have no purpose being on campus and have individual jobs that can be accomplished from across the world without issues.

What people really mean is that your teammates/colleagues are generally nice. But when you really look at the Culture carefully, which should come from senior leadership and HR, there is much to be desired.

The commonly utilized tools and methods no longer contribute to my professional growth. Additionally, many of the skills held by senior engineers have limited value beyond this company. In many cases, they appear disconnected from the current industry trends and developments. 2. Having read the low-rated reviews prior to joining Esri and now experiencing it firsthand, I can confirm the reality. Establishing career progression indeed seems to be an extremely challenging task in Esri. I found the learning experience in this regard to be quite limited.

The school district is good, the town is small, traffic within the city is manageable, and it's safe for families. However, it's bland, boring, and hot. If you are relocating to Redlands, do your research properly - I did not, and I'm regretting every moment of living here. One person's comment about its proximity to LA and OC seems a bit off. The reality is that it's about a 1.5-hour drive (without traffic) via the i91 freeway. This freeway is known for being one of the most terrible freeways in California. Finding apartments in Redlands can also be a bit of a challenge. Most of the new constructions are in the northern part of Redlands, and they tend to charge a higher price that might not align with what Redlands offers as a city. 9.

Some of the team members have no purpose being on campus and have individual jobs that can be accomplished from across the world without issues. Yet, HR makes them drive 2 hours, 3 times a week in the name of hybrid. Salary could be higher Pay is hourly for some reason Culture: Lots of talk about good culture in reviews. What people really mean is that your teammates/colleagues are generally nice. But when you really look at the Culture carefully, which should come from senior leadership and HR, there is much to be desired. Bad behaviors are often not reported, ignored are dealt with in a way that doesn't correct the bad behaviors. No Career Path: Unless you are very junior you will quickly run into a ceiling. Career paths are not discussed and or formalized because there really aren't any. Low Pay/Raises: Expect to get low single digit pay raises regardless of your performance."

Steady work Salary is competitive Culture is collaborative Tuition reimbursement program is nice Pay was fantastic and some breaks","Really though, all this to use the website? Total pay is based on length of service or experince and not really results or performance. Even with Eastman's ""pay for performance"" model, actual performance has minimal to no impact on salary. Total comp is no longer competitive with market and engineers are leaving for significant pay increases elsewhere. Company is laying off people at least every other year. Huge drive on effectiveness and increasing output with less staff supporting an aging (100+ yrs old) facility in Kingsport. - Frenetic pace of work that keeps getting faster. Management's response lately has been to focus on holding meetings more productively, but meetings aren't the issue for most of us; there is just too much to do. - Pay increases have been less than half the rate of inflation the last couple of years, even for high achievers. As a result, there is a lot of turnover, which makes things more difficult for the ones who stay. - Involuntary reductions in force are coming more frequently now - every couple of years.

It becomes very clear that the stockholders are far more valued than employees. Every 18 months or so, Eastman has layoffs. And they consistently drop their the most tenured (presumably most expensive) employees.Really though, all this to use the website? Total pay is based on length of service or experince and not really results or performance. Even with Eastman's ""pay for performance"" model, actual performance has minimal to no impact on salary. Total comp is no longer competitive with market and engineers are leaving for significant pay increases elsewhere. Company is laying off people at least every other year. Huge drive on effectiveness and increasing output with less staff supporting an aging (100+ yrs old) facility in Kingsport. - Frenetic pace of work that keeps getting faster. Management's response lately has been to focus on holding meetings more productively, but meetings aren't the issue for most of us; there is just too much to do. - Pay increases have been less than half the rate of inflation the last couple of years, even for high achievers. As a result, there is a lot of turnover, which makes things more difficult for the ones who stay. - Involuntary reductions in force are coming more frequently now - every couple of years. There are people who have been here for full, long careers but they have had to make it through numerous layoffs. - While the molecular recycling effort is exciting, there seem to be a lot of eggs being put in that one basket. - Optimism is a required behavior...saying anything negative can get you bumped down in your performance ratings because you're not being optimistic enough. Very structured management with more layers being added every day. The turnover is impacting every employee in that they are not backfilling positions and expecting current employees to bear the weight of up to three peoples’ job responsibilities. Even when the employee goes to management they just give the same response that it is temporary but three years later is still the same. The benefits are getting cut back to the point they are below the industry and they are still looking for more opportunities to reduce that spend regardless of how it impacts employee morale. Even though they promote work life balance there was not one vacation that was not interrupted by a phone call or email that could have waited until return to office. The vision that is communicated from the Executive Team straight through the ranks lacks substance and everyone can feel it. Even the team members in the flavor-of-the-month businesses lack enthusiasm and this is even more pronounced among businesses receiving less investment. Below the Executive team, business leaders seldom have the bravery or ability to manage expectations upwards. I am all for challenging ourselves to stretch but goals are often disconnected with reality. Compensation is great for newcomers but once we have you, forget about base compensation increases above GDP or for role changes. The salary you negotiate upon your hire is what you are stuck with plus 3% give or take the rest of your career. People are sometimes hired based on their ethnicity/gender or who they know. Not always on experience. No accountability when employees don’t do what’s asked of them. Usually leads have to pick up the slack and do multiple peoples jobs, or shift ops have to do tasks that were for day personnel. Retaliation. We are told to report when managers treat you unfairly, but you can’t because they will hold a grudge and won’t allow you to advance in the company. Safety culture is heavily preached and now you can get fired for small mistakes, but some people in leadership will call you lazy when you don’t feel safe doing something or make you rush to complete a job. People are promoted by who they befriend rather than skills/experience. Shift work gets old fast Lack of systems integration and automation Communication is lacking from the top down and from different divisions Swing shift is awful when you have to pick up constant extra shifts"

I was doing housekeeping prep paperwork for them, assigning rooms and membership flags for them, pre-authing credit cards for them, and on top of that the breakfast host REFUSED to come in before 6 (and I was frequently guilt-tripped to be thankful they're coming in before 7 like they used to, which I suspect is a lie) so I was doing the first serving of breakfast. I was also doing most of the towels by myself since the PM shift was completely alone during the weekend shifts and didn't have time to do any of it themselves (and I don't think I need to mention the lack of laundry attendants). Not to mention there is NO security, so it's only you stopping sketchy guests and potential criminals when they do arrive. And to add insult to injury, the AM shifts and breakfast hosts were frequently late and management didn't care (and sometimes it was all but stated to be because of a hangover), so you often stayed late and did breakfast host duties long past when you were supposed to. And speaking of management, they had no spine and openly bragged about how they never fired people - I guess they saw this as social justice to make sure workers weren't without needed income, but it instead lead to incompetent and toxic workers staying on far longer then they should have and only given unenforced warnings when others told management about them. The housekeeping even was able to get management to hire one of their children on as a night auditor for under the table reasons, who genuinely did not speak English well enough to do the bare minimum of their job and took several weeks to understand even the absolute basics of the tasks required of them. The work culture could best be described as caring WAY too much about the well-being of the hotel, with ""we're all family here"" being the key phrase. During meetings, it was stressed how important it was to go above and beyond to please customers, often to the point of putting ourselves in danger of being alone with a predatory guest (with only a bare token of ""use your best judgement"" if we pointed this out). Also during these meetings, alcohol was freely given and any teetotalers were pressured to drink with them, with hungover workers being common the day after, and teetotalers were expected to compensate for not partying with them by cleaning up after the party and staying extra hours to let the hungover sleep in. Security was ridiculously spotty: besides not hiring any security and with explicit instructions that our security was calling 911, standards of maintaining guest and employee safety were very lax. The standard protocol of requiring a guest's full name and room number before giving information or transferring a call was not uphold, and management legitimately seemed confused when it was brought up; they seemed to think that requiring it was prudish and admonished me for upholding it. Management also had not heard of Kari's Law, which requires anyone calling 911 to not require a prefix or suffix for the call to go through, which put the guests in severe danger. When domestic violence victims stayed with us and requested extra security measures to feel safe around them, THEY were the ones getting kicked out for ""endangering other guests"" because of a fear that whoever they were running from would disrupt the hotel. On the other hand, employees were explicitly told to go into guests rooms to help fix mechanical issues even when we were by ourselves in order to please customers, and only a token notion of ""use your best judgement"" was brought up when employees mentioned the possibility of sketchy guests potentially making up excuses to get a worker alone with them Sometimes can be stressful, especially if you live near a casino. Sometimes you get rude guests, but thats everywhere. Didn’t receive raise when offered waited until my last check to give me. They offered that for me to stay a bit longer. I gave several weeks notice. Not much for employee recognitions when it’s rated #1 in the nation -Terrible management who doesn't support you Poor Management among Head of Departments. No career growth, empty promise. You will forever in the position that been hired for because all the Head of Departments cannot grow to anywhere therefore you are not able to get promotion too.

I was doing housekeeping prep paperwork for them, assigning rooms and membership flags for them, pre-authing credit cards for them, and on top of that the breakfast host REFUSED to come in before 6 (and I was frequently guilt-tripped to be thankful they're coming in before 7 like they used to, which I suspect is a lie) so I was doing the first serving of breakfast. I was also doing most of the towels by myself since the PM shift was completely alone during the weekend shifts and didn't have time to do any of it themselves (and I don't think I need to mention the lack of laundry attendants). Not to mention there is NO security, so it's only you stopping sketchy guests and potential criminals when they do arrive. And to add insult to injury, the AM shifts and breakfast hosts were frequently late and management didn't care (and sometimes it was all but stated to be because of a hangover), so you often stayed late and did breakfast host duties long past when you were supposed to. And speaking of management, they had no spine and openly bragged about how they never fired people - I guess they saw this as social justice to make sure workers weren't without needed income, but it instead lead to incompetent and toxic workers staying on far longer then they should have and only given unenforced warnings when others told management about them. The housekeeping even was able to get management to hire one of their children on as a night auditor for under the table reasons, who genuinely did not speak English well enough to do the bare minimum of their job and took several weeks to understand even the absolute basics of the tasks required of them. The work culture could best be described as caring WAY too much about the well-being of the hotel, with ""we're all family here"" being the key phrase. During meetings, it was stressed how important it was to go above and beyond to please customers, often to the point of putting ourselves in danger of being alone with a predatory guest (with only a bare token of ""use your best judgement"" if we pointed this out). Also during these meetings, alcohol was freely given and any teetotalers were pressured to drink with them, with hungover workers being common the day after, and teetotalers were expected to compensate for not partying with them by cleaning up after the party and staying extra hours to let the hungover sleep in. Security was ridiculously spotty: besides not hiring any security and with explicit instructions that our security was calling 911, standards of maintaining guest and employee safety were very lax. The standard protocol of requiring a guest's full name and room number before giving information or transferring a call was not uphold, and management legitimately seemed confused when it was brought up; they seemed to think that requiring it was prudish and admonished me for upholding it. Management also had not heard of Kari's Law, which requires anyone calling 911 to not require a prefix or suffix for the call to go through, which put the guests in severe danger. When domestic violence victims stayed with us and requested extra security measures to feel safe around them, THEY were the ones getting kicked out for ""endangering other guests"" because of a fear that whoever they were running from would disrupt the hotel. On the other hand, employees were explicitly told to go into guests rooms to help fix mechanical issues even when we were by ourselves in order to please customers, and only a token notion of ""use your best judgement"" was brought up when employees mentioned the possibility of sketchy guests potentially making up excuses to get a worker alone with them Staff is always short and you’re not paid for how long you’re there Sometimes can be stressful, especially if you live near a casino.

Definitely not recommend Staff is always short and you’re not paid for how long you’re there -Schedule can be rough at times. -High turn over had to work football saturdays so much shifts for one person to handle- Horrible, unkind, neglectful management - Hotel did not adhere to brand standards - Violated several employee's rights codes and laws - No hazard, holiday, or personal / vacation paid time off - Guilted when sick days were taken (even though they were unpaid) - High turnover rate and untrained staff - Overworked employees, no breaks, little time off when needed or requested - Management implemented ""black out dates"" for any requested time off (even though no PTO was provided anyway) - Severe workplace gossip, hostile work environment - No sick days - Employees are forced to work inter-departmentally and do multiple jobs at once, are often re-scheduled to work on their scheduled days off - Health and cleanliness violations I guess everyone is jealous of night auditors having a quiet shift, because within 6 months of my employment I was doing about half to three quarters of morning shifts job and most of the breakfast shifts job. I was doing housekeeping prep paperwork for them, assigning rooms and membership flags for them, pre-authing credit cards for them, and on top of that the breakfast host REFUSED to come in before 6 (and I was frequently guilt-tripped to be thankful they're coming in before 7 like they used to, which I suspect is a lie) so I was doing the first serving of breakfast. I was also doing most of the towels by myself since the PM shift was completely alone during the weekend shifts and didn't have time to do any of it themselves (and I don't think I need to mention the lack of laundry attendants). Not to mention there is NO security, so it's only you stopping sketchy guests and potential criminals when they do arrive. And to add insult to injury, the AM shifts and breakfast hosts were frequently late and management didn't care (and sometimes it was all but stated to be because of a hangover), so you often stayed late and did breakfast host duties long past when you were supposed to. And speaking of management, they had no spine and openly bragged about how they never fired people - I guess they saw this as social justice to make sure workers weren't without needed income, but it instead lead to incompetent and toxic workers staying on far longer then they should have and only given unenforced warnings when others told management about them. The housekeeping even was able to get management to hire one of their children on as a night auditor for under the table reasons, who genuinely did not speak English well enough to do the bare minimum of their job and took several weeks to understand even the absolute basics of the tasks required of them. The work culture could best be described as caring WAY too much about the well-being of the hotel, with ""we're all family here"" being the key phrase. During meetings, it was stressed how important it was to go above and beyond to please customers, often to the point of putting ourselves in danger of being alone with a predatory guest (with only a bare token of ""use your best judgement"" if we pointed this out). Also during these meetings, alcohol was freely given and any teetotalers were pressured to drink with them, with hungover workers being common the day after, and teetotalers were expected to compensate for not partying with them by cleaning up after the party and staying extra hours to let the hungover sleep in. Security was ridiculously spotty: besides not hiring any security and with explicit instructions that our security was calling 911, standards of maintaining guest and employee safety were very lax. The standard protocol of requiring a guest's full name and room number before giving information or transferring a call was not uphold, and management legitimately seemed confused when it was brought up; they seemed to think that requiring it was prudish and admonished me for upholding it. Management also had not heard of Kari's Law, which requires anyone calling 911 to not require a prefix or suffix for the call to go through, which put the guests in severe danger. When domestic violence victims stayed with us and requested extra security measures to feel safe around them, THEY were the ones getting kicked out for ""endangering other guests"" because of a fear that whoever they were running from would disrupt the hotel. On the other hand, employees were explicitly told to go into guests rooms to help fix mechanical issues even when we were by ourselves in order to please customers, and only a token notion of ""use your best judgement"" was brought up when employees mentioned the possibility of sketchy guests potentially making up excuses to get a worker alone with them Sometimes can be stressful, especially if you live near a casino. Sometimes you get rude guests, but thats everywhere. Didn’t receive raise when offered waited until my last check to give me. They offered that for me to stay a bit longer. I gave several weeks notice. Not much for employee recognitions when it’s rated #1 in the nation -Terrible management who doesn't support you Poor Management among Head of Departments. No career growth, empty promise. You will forever in the position that been hired for because all the Head of Departments cannot grow to anywhere therefore you are not able to get promotion too.

It was a spreadsheet coupled with a few live meetings that was not for my role. - for sales team, there’s too many mandatory marketing tasks that are pushed and take time away from strategic account activities.High workload ( although understandable with frequent new product and version releases in a high growth environment ). Change management has not always been handled well ( but is recently much improved ) some processes can always be improved. They are actively cutting benefits like equity, bonuses, etc. to cut costs at the behest of new investors and - for the first time in 20 years - actually be a profitable business. You will have to CYA to a maniacal degree to protect yourself from your co-workers. Despite an overcompensating degree of ERGs, DEI measures, etc., it’s a toxic environment. Everyone knows the party’s over, but they’re just trying to stay in for as long as they can - and they do that by trying to throw each other under the bus. A comical overabundance of middle management, with many rookie managers who really just make everyone miserable and everything worse and more complicated. They rose into leadership to fill gaps after a large number of people left in 2020 and 2021. - Zero opportunities for promotion. - Internal opportunities are limited. - New leadership and ELT are clueless and don't care. - The talent acquisition leadership is absolutely tone deaf. They took a great org and demolished it. They implemented new tools and processes that are horribly time consuming and make no sense. The VP and TA Director have no idea how to recruit. They are very cutthroat and will throw you out the door if you don't agree with them and play the politics game. They have no interest in getting to know you or defend you. They will constantly call you out and take the business's word over yours so document everything!! - A lot of leadership churn in the last year (expected with new CEO ) but I think this change is good and at times necessary as we're evolving as a company - When I joined last year, I was surprised with the lack of processes and tools in place, and it made our jobs a lot more difficult to get things done. The good news is that with the overwhelming feedback from across the company around tech debt and lack of operational efficiency, the leadership team took that feedback and rolled out new process and tools to address this. There's a lot of change management through this and the transition has not been easy or seamless but I'm optimistic that this will set the team up for success and scalability in the long term. Your role is constantly changing. Leadership was changed and the company culture was changed completely. Too many complicated processes and reports.. Many in management not in the right job for their experience and skillset, so they become defensive and a problem, and their managers don't step forward to coach them.
