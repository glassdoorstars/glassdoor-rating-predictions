However, due to inability to set expectations and be a real technology company, they eventually revert back to offshoring. Too many changes before the dust settles on the last restructure Too large to be close with teammates No work life balance, can’t keep underwriters due to difficult underwriting management team.A bit of microagressions Faced some racism there The company does not have a clear vision. Every year it changes and they wonder why there isn't a lot of employee engagement with their ideas. There are certain middle management individuals who make major decisions without the leaders knowledge which could put the company in legal jeopardy. There are no 'checks and balances' to make sure all work is in compliance. These particular managers direct their reports to do things knowing they are not right, and it puts employees in a very bad position. The company bought the Norwood group/book of business, but have let most of them go. Those clients left because they recognized TA couldn't deliver what was promised. In turn, they let the Norwood people go because they are paid more than the IOWA employees. Bad move, as the Norwood team has more knowledge and commitment to delivering quality service. TA is a insurance company, and that is what they should stick to. They will never be a big player in the 401(k) market. • No focus on career growth • Absent executive leadership (i.e. they are not accessible) • Teams work in silos and very rarely work cross-functionally • Heavily layered organization • Not enough focus on culture (i.e. lacking one) • Lack of training among new management and leadership staff (i.e. a lot of micro managing) Get used to being autonomous, this position will challenge you to make professional decisions, supervisors are around but are often busy, and will expect you to handle customer complaints. The senior leadership team is struggling to make a decision regarding whether to offshore or onshore all software development. While their preference is to offshore, past attempts have consistently failed, leading to a return to onshore development. However, due to inability to set expectations and be a real technology company, they eventually revert back to offshoring. So far have not discovered any Too large to be close with teammates No work life balance, can’t keep underwriters due to difficult underwriting management team. Constant leadership changes and reorganizational and internal changes New leadership was a lift and shift from another competitor. Makes sense but anyone hired into prior vision was riffed and tenured employees were extremely disengaged. No change management to help employees buy in. Very limited loyalty to brand/company outside if financial benefits. Seem to keep moving deck chairs on the titanic."

I have had the chance to try different things and grow with the company. I have been able to move shifts to make my job work for my life, helping to balance my home/kids, work, and starting back to school to get my advance nursing degree. I have worked with great managers who do listen and help work out schedules and workload. I also take part with the Business Resources Groups which has helped to network and expand my reach within the system. Not everyday is perfect, but overall I have loved working here. Team work and work with lovely team members Great team members, flexible schedule Flexible schedule as PRN Fine management Benefits. Pay is ok to start but raises are minimal after that First hospital job, being PRN and making minimum wage $14/hr is not great living in the largest city in this state; but not having to worry about PTO is the tradeoff. Opportunities for teaching students. Well structured training. Managers have 5 to 30 years of experience. Employee bathrooms are dirty, falling apart, nothing gets fixed, leaky toilets, leaky ceiling, our department has not had any improvements done in over 20 years. Good benefits Remote Decent PTO accrusl Good management , decent benefits Good Organization Objectives, AME Training that explains things in practical terms and clear applications demonstrated with how to help patients, work well with teammates and effectively with other teams, great benefits Solid PMO at the time.

As a staff nurse you are often answering phones, call bells, handing out meal trays, etc. I have also experienced personal safety issues with patients, but I don't blame the workplace for patient/family violence-that is the nature of the job I suppose (although NOT acceptable). no increase paid in department Poor communication organization-wide, low morale, unfair pay structure Despite this being a “receptionist” position where you are expected to wear dress shoes, you are expected to stand every time someone comes in. Some locations even have you stand more than sitting. I have not had any patients comment positively on this, but I have had patients say it’s overwhelming or seems senseless. Standing up just to sit back down or walking patients to an area just 10 steps away seems redundant. Wayfinding for more difficult areas is completely sensible, but I think the position should be the same as any other medical office and standing this doesn’t contribute to a “remarkable experience” it is simply more of a nuisance. Employees who work directly with patients are not heard, we are expected to blindly follow the “SPARK initiative.” I have worked here for over two years, but with the raise of company minimum, I am not paid the same as an employee who just started. I have mentioned this to management to no avail. I have asked numerous times to become part time because with my seniority, I believe I deserve benefits, guaranteed hours, and PTO like my colleagues. This is how you lower morale and lose good employees. Supervisors and managers were constantly being caught in lies and overhead gossiping at the facility I worked at. Huge turnover rate affected patient care but they only cared about money and not the patients. Overall felt like high school and not a professional place to work. I can barely make any ends meet with minimum wage. No tuition reimbursement for being PRN, or payroll deduction, or other benefits. Medical plans are too expensive. Almost no opportunities for bonuses, recognition, incentives for overtime pay, or promotions in this department. Payscales have not adjusted in 10 years. New graduates should have starting pay of $28 to $33/hr but get offered less than $22/hr. Experienced Lab Techs should be making up to $40/hr because of their experience, but unfortunately this profession has to improve on its visibility and recognition to the public. Managers need to be more understanding, wiling to accept new ideas or changes, shift focus from productivity reports and meetings onto their people's needs. No Baylor plan, work 2 weekends every 6 weeks Not much at this point If you aren't the chosen few you are left out. What you say doesn't matter. Be ready to just be a robot until the new system is in place and yhe downsizing starts. Don't worry, the chosen few have insulated themselves to mgnt and will be fine.

High Expectations: Working for a prestigious brand like Tiffany & Co. often comes with high expectations in terms of performance, customer service, and attention to detail. The pressure to meet these expectations can be demanding. Workload and Retail Hours: Retail jobs, including those at Tiffany & Co., typically involve working on weekends, holidays, and evenings to cater to customer needs. This may result in a less predictable work-life balance and require flexibility in scheduling. Competitive Environment: The luxury retail industry can be highly competitive. Meeting sales targets, dealing with demanding customers, and striving for excellence can create a challenging work environment. Limited Career Advancement: The opportunities for career advancement within Tiffany & Co. may be limited, particularly in terms of upward mobility. Advancement may require significant time and effort, and there may be limited openings at higher levels. Pricing Pressure and Sales Targets: In a luxury retail setting, there can be pressure to meet sales targets, upsell products, and handle customer negotiations. Balancing customer satisfaction with achieving sales goals can be a delicate task. Tiffany and Co. can be a challenging place to work for due to the toxic management that fosters a demoralizing culture. Employees may face communication lags and inconsistent feedback, and they often have to repeat themselves, which can be frustrating. The company's policy of leaving employees to figure out the details to complete their work, with minimal time to make up for any errors, can add to the already high-pressure environment. These factors combine to create a work environment that can be demotivating for employees. Very fast environment. Long hours. Nothing. bad to say right now. I cannot think of a down side Difficult retail schedule with working holidays and weekends"
