Having to be at the store at 4 am is not ideal and does not support work-life balance. The structure of the business is difficult by default. The store is small and crammed full of stuff. The inventory system is pen and paper; this invites oversight and mistakes. There are electronic scanners, but moving to all electronic would help immensely. There is no great way to deal with heavy items during truck day and this can lead to injury. The pay is so low that turn over is very heavy. Slow at times Lot of just stocking products Fast-paced environment and a lot going onNo cons I can currently think of. dealing with customers hours are fluid Retail is the only downfall Compensation/annual salary increases are just at or below cost of living Sometimes the customers can try your patience with their entitlement to discounts, and some of the older men get to being a bit annoying if you're a female with tool knowledge. too many sales, work life balance The reason for call centers is simple.

I have no cons. My experience was great Around 2011 to 2019, UOP went through several reorganizations of the instructional design, development and curriculum departments which caused quite a bit of upheaval and challenges regarding having enough people to work on the hundreds and thousands of courses and supplemental instructional projects. There was too much unpredictability in regards to rapidly shifting directives from various executive level decision makers. However since 2020, I am not sure how the internal operations is doing but I do know they made more changes to the University curriculum in some of the colleges, like Humanities. Some of which appear to be good changes. None I can think of Higher Education is going through a lot of changes due to increased competition (every school now does online) and advances in technology constantly changes what is possible so you need to be someone who likes change (I do but if you do not, that would be a con) Because the systems are cutting edge, they are hard for new hires to grasp. There is not much freedom there, they are very strict with phone management. Very micromanaging, constantly nit-picking the small things and ignoring the big achievements. Very high turn-over rates because of low starting pay and complex systems for new hires.lots of work to do, many hours Nothing that I have seen …….there are no cons, i love working here Could have more flexible schedules Around 2011 to 2019, UOP went through several reorganizations of the instructional design, development and curriculum departments which caused quite a bit of upheaval and challenges regarding having enough people to work on the hundreds and thousands of courses and supplemental instructional projects.

My experience was great Miss a month of quotas or make mistakes you will be fired without notice * Functions as a call center. * Many escalated student calls or students who complain we call too often. * Performance metrics and department standards leave very, very little room for autonomy over one's work day. * If you have a disability, ask for ADA accommodations, or use FMLA time, you will be made to maneuver through unnecessary red tape disguised as corporate policies, you'll be asked to provide redundant medical documents over and over as a stall tactic to effective accommodations being put in place, your performance metrics will be placed under a microscope in an already overly micromanage-y environment, managers & department leadership will pretend they don't work with HR on ADA accommodations, and/or you will face harassment, a hostile & toxic work environment, corrective action, retaliation, and/or a target will be placed on your back for termination. managers are very different, and I feel like management would change every few months, so it can be difficult adjusting to different managers and expectations.

My experience was great Around 2011 to 2019, UOP went through several reorganizations of the instructional design, development and curriculum departments which caused quite a bit of upheaval and challenges regarding having enough people to work on the hundreds and thousands of courses and supplemental instructional projects. There was too much unpredictability in regards to rapidly shifting directives from various executive level decision makers. However since 2020, I am not sure how the internal operations is doing but I do know they made more changes to the University curriculum in some of the colleges, like Humanities.

None I can think of Higher Education is going through a lot of changes due to increased competition (every school now does online) and advances in technology constantly changes what is possible so you need to be someone who likes change (I do but if you do not, that would be a con) Because the systems are cutting edge, they are hard for new hires to grasp. There is not much freedom there, they are very strict with phone management. Very micromanaging, constantly nit-picking the small things and ignoring the big achievements. Very high turn-over rates because of low starting pay and complex systems for new hires.lots of work to do, many hours Nothing that I have seen …….there are no cons, i love working here Could have more flexible schedules Around 2011 to 2019, UOP went through several reorganizations of the instructional design, development and curriculum departments which caused quite a bit of upheaval and challenges regarding having enough people to work on the hundreds and thousands of courses and supplemental instructional projects.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cengage-Group-Reviews-E20055.htm,"I've worked with Cengage for almost 7 years, and I can't speak highly enough about the organization. The CEO (Michael) cares about the company, and more importantly, the roughly 5,000 people who make the magic happen. Cengage listens to each and every employee to help further company ambition and objectives. This was clearly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond regarding remote work (now standard for most employees). From a personal perspective, I've been able to climb the corporate ladder with great mentors and feedback - you just have to put in the work! I've met some great people, and collaborating with different teams has been a joy. In addition, management cares about your goals and will help you get there. Call be a loyalist, but I'm dedicated to Cengage after what I've seen us accomplish. Join us, you won't regret it! Job was great, wonderful people, lots of flexibility with work life balance. Cengage just keeps getting better and better, gaining momentum every day, and striving to truly be the best and do the best they can for its customers and employees. I've been employed with Cengage several different times since 1999, and I can say that the current leadership, culture, and focus that we have at Cengage right now is the best yet. We live our Credo and Ethos from top to bottom. From my perspective, that has catapulted this company from a customer-focused company to a well-rounded company that focuses not only on the customer's needs, but also its employee's needs. Employees are offered wonderful benefits, competitive pay, and lots of paid time off. It’s so refreshing working for a company that truly cares. Leadership is willing to not only listen to feedback from employees, but willing to take the steps necessary to see suggestions from concept to completion. There are so many other things I love as well, but one in particular is all of the free development courses we can take to further our careers within Cengage. I love working at Cengage. It's by far my favorite place I've worked at in this capacity. As a former teacher, I still yearn to make a difference in students' lives, and I get to do that here by helping teachers make informed decisions and getting the best possible curriculum into their hands. The culture here is very positive, family time is respected, and coworkers are here to help. Cengage truly cares about your well being through our Wellness Days, which are company-wide days off/breaks. The pay is competitive and benefits have been comparable, if not better with more options, than at other places I've been. I honestly hope I retire from Cengage! I have been with Cengage Group for several years now, and from the outset, I was immersed in an environment that values innovation, collaboration, and the pursuit of top talent. It's not just a job; it's a fulfilling mission to bring together the brightest minds and diverse skill sets that drive the company's ongoing success. Cengage Group's commitment to professional growth is evident even within the Talent Acquisition department. The resources, mentorship opportunities, and continuous learning initiatives have empowered me to hone my skills and excel in my role. The leadership team's investment in my development has been pivotal in achieving both personal and team milestones. As a long term employee I have been grateful for opportunities to grow in my career, with the benefit of working for a company I believe in. With the broad array of roles within the company I've been able to move both up and laterally as my interests and skillset has grow. The company culture is supportive, with flexibility and an emphasis on a balance of work and life. The Employee Resource Groups are well supported and offer different avenues to make connections across Cengage. I worked at Cengage 5+ years in a variety of marketing roles in the Higher Ed Division. I think your experience would vary greatly depending on which business unit you are apart of, as we had little collaboration with other departments like Nat Geo Learning, InfoSec or Milady. As a larger Company Group, the CEO is really great. The communication, First Fridays and updates are really appreciated and helped you to feel connected to the larger goals of the company. We always appreciated hearing from different parts of the business and it helped us get an insight into overall company strategy. The benefits are really good. This includes the generous 401K match, PTO, parental leave, holidays and more. Overall the benefits are extremely competitive. As for the Higher Ed Division, the people were really great. Most people at almost all levels are willing to jump into help and always put the customer first. There's a really strong customer first mindset that helps guide most decisions. The team meetings and sales meetings were always fun, informative and a great way to collaborate with colleagues. The remote work policy is great, and the offices that are available are very nice. I'd consider myself midway through my career and I can easily say with 100% certainty that this is the best company I've ever worked for. The list of pros is long but a few things that make it the best include the hard-working, engaged, committed and collaborate people that I get to work with every day. I feel that my day to day work is interesting, meaningful and impactful. Cengage is an exciting place to be - we're growing and the work we do is innovate and life changing. Compared to other companies, you get a sense of belonging at Cengage. While salaries tend to be on the lower side, there are many great benefits and a good amount of stability at Cengage. Most employees have a sense of pride and commitment to the company. I recenlty celebrated my two-year anniversary and I continue to be so pleased with not only the work environment here at Cengage but also the work itself. The work is meaningful, the people are predominantly blue-ribbon human, the balance is manageable and the culture is transparent & inclusive. I hope to be here for a long time and I'll continue to refer great people to join this great place.I've worked with Cengage for almost 7 years, and I can't speak highly enough about the organization.

At each stage of my time here, I have been supported by caring and genuine managers that have sought to help me grow my skills and climb the proverbial ladder. Like many people, I receive messages from external recruiters who try and pry me away from Cengage Group, to no avail. I am very happy with where I am and give Cengage kudos for the work environment and culture in which they've built.

I've met some great people, and collaborating with different teams has been a joy. In addition, management cares about your goals and will help you get there. Call be a loyalist, but I'm dedicated to Cengage after what I've seen us accomplish. Join us, you won't regret it! Job was great, wonderful people, lots of flexibility with work life balance. Cengage just keeps getting better and better, gaining momentum every day, and striving to truly be the best and do the best they can for its customers and employees. I've been employed with Cengage several different times since 1999, and I can say that the current leadership, culture, and focus that we have at Cengage right now is the best yet. We live our Credo and Ethos from top to bottom. From my perspective, that has catapulted this company from a customer-focused company to a well-rounded company that focuses not only on the customer's needs, but also its employee's needs. Employees are offered wonderful benefits, competitive pay, and lots of paid time off. It’s so refreshing working for a company that truly cares. Leadership is willing to not only listen to feedback from employees, but willing to take the steps necessary to see suggestions from concept to completion. There are so many other things I love as well, but one in particular is all of the free development courses we can take to further our careers within Cengage. I love working at Cengage. It's by far my favorite place I've worked at in this capacity. As a former teacher, I still yearn to make a difference in students' lives, and I get to do that here by helping teachers make informed decisions and getting the best possible curriculum into their hands. The culture here is very positive, family time is respected, and coworkers are here to help. Cengage truly cares about your well being through our Wellness Days, which are company-wide days off/breaks. The pay is competitive and benefits have been comparable, if not better with more options, than at other places I've been. I honestly hope I retire from Cengage! I have been with Cengage Group for several years now, and from the outset, I was immersed in an environment that values innovation, collaboration, and the pursuit of top talent. It's not just a job; it's a fulfilling mission to bring together the brightest minds and diverse skill sets that drive the company's ongoing success. Cengage Group's commitment to professional growth is evident even within the Talent Acquisition department. The resources, mentorship opportunities, and continuous learning initiatives have empowered me to hone my skills and excel in my role. The leadership team's investment in my development has been pivotal in achieving both personal and team milestones. As a long term employee I have been grateful for opportunities to grow in my career, with the benefit of working for a company I believe in. With the broad array of roles within the company I've been able to move both up and laterally as my interests and skillset has grow. The company culture is supportive, with flexibility and an emphasis on a balance of work and life. The Employee Resource Groups are well supported and offer different avenues to make connections across Cengage. I'd consider myself midway through my career and I can easily say with 100% certainty that this is the best company I've ever worked for. The list of pros is long but a few things that make it the best include the hard-working, engaged, committed and collaborate people that I get to work with every day. I feel that my day to day work is interesting, meaningful and impactful. Cengage is an exciting place to be - we're growing and the work we do is innovate and life changing. Compared to other companies, you get a sense of belonging at Cengage. While salaries tend to be on the lower side, there are many great benefits and a good amount of stability at Cengage. Most employees have a sense of pride and commitment to the company. I've been with Cengage Group for over 5 years and been blessed with the opportunity to have held multiple roles. At each stage of my time here, I have been supported by caring and genuine managers that have sought to help me grow my skills and climb the proverbial ladder. Like many people, I receive messages from external recruiters who try and pry me away from Cengage Group, to no avail. I am very happy with where I am and give Cengage kudos for the work environment and culture in which they've built. Cengage doesn't just say ""we care about our employees"", but actually puts things into action that make statements like that come to life. I worked at Cengage 5+ years in a variety of marketing roles in the Higher Ed Division. I think your experience would vary greatly depending on which business unit you are apart of, as we had little collaboration with other departments like Nat Geo Learning, InfoSec or Milady. As a larger Company Group, the CEO is really great. The communication, First Fridays and updates are really appreciated and helped you to feel connected to the larger goals of the company. We always appreciated hearing from different parts of the business and it helped us get an insight into overall company strategy. The benefits are really good. This includes the generous 401K match, PTO, parental leave, holidays and more. Overall the benefits are extremely competitive. As for the Higher Ed Division, the people were really great. Most people at almost all levels are willing to jump into help and always put the customer first. There's a really strong customer first mindset that helps guide most decisions. The team meetings and sales meetings were always fun, informative and a great way to collaborate with colleagues. The remote work policy is great, and the offices that are available are very nice.I've worked with Cengage for almost 7 years, and I can't speak highly enough about the organization. The CEO (Michael) cares about the company, and more importantly, the roughly 5,000 people who make the magic happen. Cengage listens to each and every employee to help further company ambition and objectives.

Most people at almost all levels are willing to jump into help and always put the customer first. There's a really strong customer first mindset that helps guide most decisions. The team meetings and sales meetings were always fun, informative and a great way to collaborate with colleagues. The remote work policy is great, and the offices that are available are very nice.","My only ""con"" would be that we are not a public company, but rather backed by private investors. Hoping that we are listed on the U.S. Stock Exchange in the future like other top publishers. None really, I liked what I did, I met wonderful people and made good money. I cannot think of any cons to share at this time. I have a ton of meetings that I consider important enough for me to be at personally, but it keeps me from doing my day to day work. So in my role, I am always busy, but with a manager who listens to concerns and grows the team as needed, all I need to do is speak up. While potential cons can be difficult to find, I would say that you need to be comfortable with change and adaptability. Cengage is dedicated to innovation and staying at the forefront of educational solutions, and therefore employees may experience periods of high intensity and rapid change. Being a large company it can be difficult to be as nimble as I would like, especially around AI. But I understand this also demonstrated a commitment to our authors, content providers, and customers. Change is constant. Thats something that lots of reviews say but its genuinely true. I think during my time I had to have gone through at least four reorgs, one potential merger and several serious layoffs. When I first started, the Marketing Team for Higher Ed was huge and over the years its shrunk down to an incredibly small size, yet still expected to deliver the same results. If you aren't change adverse this shouldn't be a problem but definitely something to keep in mind. The pay is way below market value. Most offers I got to leave were considerably above what I was making. Especially compared to tech companies, the pay can be seriously lacking. You have to advocate hard for yourself when it comes to pay raises, but management is occasionally open to it. The product isn't the greatest. The overall purchasing models are innovative and definitely a positive, but the products themselves are lacking. Software looks like its from 10 years ago, outages were common, and systems were set up in a way that made access more complicated then it needed to be for customers. Rather then build something new from the ground up, new products were frequently components of others products repackaged and resold. Leadership changes hurt overall strategy and moral. Especially for the Higher Education division, the latest change to combine with other BU's/regions really hurt team moral, productivity and produced tons of confusion. You can almost pinpoint issues popping up as soon as one GM left and two others took over. Sentiment was very common among employees that we lacked clear direction. Internal systems were lacking. Didn't use the latest Martech or CRM (at the time) and made you feel like you were behind compared to colleagues who worked at other companies. Upward mobility was very challenging. Rarely did we see IC's get promoted to management but rather just another level of IC. Management hires usually came from competitors and always seemed to have some connection to leadership. There is a lot of change but I understand that this is necessary to stay relevant and growing. A lot of my colleagues complain about tons of small things at Cengage, but at the end of the day none of them ever want to leave. Many of those who do leave tend to want to come back or do actually come back. At times, it seems like the transparency of our culture has the negative side effect of folks sharing opinions that aren't appropriate for a professional adult to be sharing.

The training made no sense, the guy who took over my training who was also my manager basically just read the material at us, it made zero sense.... Leads would get annoyed when you called in asking about stuff since you didn't understand. You get callers who are elderly that can take an hour plus to log into an account, and they expect you to complete calls in ten minutes or less. There's no QA team, they give you a QA score but there's never any review or continuous improvement or motivation from your managers to improve you. The only time my manager ever interacted with me was to tell me I failed a QA and make me take a test, or make me do compliance work that teaches you nothing. Managers delegate any task other than teller work to Bankers Bankers and Tellers both get paid $20 an hour No raises High sales environment You get penalized for how clients use their accounts 1 hour account opening processes 10-20 minute teller transaction processes Constantly short staffed / High Turnover Terrible operating systems Branches upkeep and maintenance is minimal at best Managers sit on conference calls at peak branch hours Bonuses have a 45 day waiting period and any mistake made in this period could take your entire earned bonus away Post COVID, the Bank has been trying to be sold so investment in people, salaries, technology and operations has been at an all time low. Long time management has most left the company, and since the bank was bought by BMO everything has been in a holding pattern. Horrid system. Poor management, revolving door of turnover. Hectic, poor training, not fully transparent. no opportunity for growth and mundane. Very pushy with the liberal agenda. There was a ""hidden"" agenda in most of the training and company values. I was told there wouldn't be any sales expectations in my position, but that was misinformation. There were even penalties if you didn't push credit cards or additional products.
