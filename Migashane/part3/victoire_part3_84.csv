Very obviously a sign that it has gutted its support and sales staff. I would not recommend anyone bother to apply for work with Appen. At times not enough work or no work at all, no projects available, decrease in hours, little to no interaction with support, projects canceled even though it said long term, contract cancels with vague explanation, but guess that is their right. Work can be monotonous, and work is not guaranteed. Lack of proper communication. No phone communication whatsoever, only by sending in tickets and emails. They hired me for a project for me to review advertisements and I worked hard at this task and always looked back at the materials as a guideline to keep all my answers as per how they want them to be. However, this was not good enough for them and I was retested. Of course, I knew they would fail the retest and fire me immediately. In addition, I have been putting in my house on my time sheet and they have not paid me once. They claim I will be paid for the hours I billed for but I have not seen any money yet. I am giving up on seeing any pay and my working with Appen has been a total waste of my time when I could have been putting in my efforts working for someone else. There is no access to contact management, no salary rise petitions accepted confusing tickets, false red flags rare sight of project managers in chat to answer questions about particular cases Very many--- Extremely long wait times to speak with support (when you are able to contact them) Many questions directed to support go completely unresponded to, and they give you a silly canned response every time Not all projects can be done 100% remotely, so require applicants to be in an exact physical location There are too many prerequisites for many projects, and many take far more time to study the requirements than what their pay is worth No advancement Confusion with guidelines Some tasks can be confusing"

As an engineer, you may face intense pressure to meet project milestones, which can lead to long working hours and increased stress levels. Unpredictable Workload: The workload in construction engineering can be unpredictable, with periods of intense activity followed by slower times. This cyclic nature may affect job stability and financial planning. Weather Dependency: Construction projects are often vulnerable to weather conditions. Inclement weather, such as heavy rain or extreme temperatures, can delay work, impacting project timelines and budgets. Physical Demands: Construction engineers may need to spend time on-site, which can involve exposure to challenging physical conditions, including extreme weather, noise, and potential hazards. Budget Constraints: Projects may have tight budget constraints, requiring engineers to find cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality and safety. Balancing these factors can be challenging. Regulatory Compliance: Construction projects must adhere to various local and national regulations and building codes. Ensuring compliance can be time-consuming and may require additional documentation and approvals. Conflict Resolution: In a collaborative environment with multiple stakeholders, conflicts can arise between different parties involved in the construction process. Resolving conflicts and maintaining effective communication can be demanding. Risk Management: Construction projects involve inherent risks, such as unforeseen site conditions, material shortages, or changes in project scope. Engineers must be skilled in risk assessment and mitigation to address these challenges. Bid Competition: In the construction industry, securing projects often involves competitive bidding. This can create pressure to offer competitive pricing, which may affect profit margins and project feasibility. Project Complexity: Some construction projects can be highly complex, requiring intricate engineering solutions. Dealing with such complexities may demand extensive problem-solving skills and technical expertise. Sustainability and Environmental Concerns: Modern construction emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendly practices. As an engineer, you may face challenges in incorporating environmentally responsible solutions while staying within project constraints. Managing Stakeholder Expectations: Construction engineers often need to manage the expectations of various stakeholders, including clients, contractors, and regulatory bodies. This can require effective communication and negotiation skills. Emotional Toll: Witnessing setbacks or delays in construction projects can be emotionally taxing, especially if you have invested significant time and effort in the planning and execution.Can be overwhelming/stressful, but support is always offered. -Very competitive culture and highly difficult to get promoted -Pay isn't very competitive.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Indiana-University-Health-Reviews-E390286.htm,"Salary is competitive, benefits are great, sense that administration cares about the employees team environment, fast-paced, learning environment Good office culture that promotes diversity. Employer encourages work-life balance, and PTO benefits reflect this. Encourages and offers support for Work -From -Home employees. Highly competent and engaged senior leadership. High volume of good benefits, with lots of options. *Pay is competitive on a per-position basis (please see “Cons” section below). Great team, good benefits, people here are genuinely nice, willing to help the ""newbie"". Hours fit with my schedule, flexible scheduling except for your required every third Saturday and Sunday which is great. some of the best coworkers i've ever had in my career physicians to housekeepers they are some of the best people i've encountered Loved working here, care was top-notch Honestly, there are almost none. One, working at the AAHC (downtown Indy) provides exposure to research and technology not found in the suburban hospitals. Second, the people working in those buildings are second to none. Room for growth and promotion Great benefits, friendly staff, professional. Good benefits, top pay, easy movement within company.","I dont have any cons to enter. busy, often under staffed, pay feels on the lower end for the duties you perform *Does not offer senior titles to professional-level employees who have earned those titles through experience, performance, responsibility and personal growth. Many people are reluctantly forced to use this company as a stepping stone because of this, rather than making it their career home, and many of the best and brightest leave within a few years because of this. So, top-flight employee retention is poor. People who work here long enough will share tales of seeking other employment, and prospective employers being confused by the responsibilities listed on their resume not matching their job title. In office amenities are usually underwhelming. Starting pay is low for paramedics. they are making it hard to move up there are favorites and predetermined plans for people that want to move up, very frustrating when you've been an advocate for your patients, co workers, and self and you get asked about it in an interview and if feels like being a leader on staff is going to stop you from progressing your career later. Low raises each year, sometimes felt like profit was more emphasized than employees Corporate greed. Employees were given a 1% raise while inflation rages at 8.5%, So, really the employees took a 7.5% decrease in pay. The CEO, Dennis Murphy, is compensated 4.7 million. The remaining executive members make no less than 1.2 million in salary alone, not to include their bonuses. What do they do directly for any patient that justifies these obscene, over inflated, greedy salaries? sometimes there's one way thinking from management On the bottom end of starting wage. Hard to find good team players, lacking from management, PTO comes out for holidays"

Great work environment You work from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. and get a full hour lunch. Working for InEd was a true pleasure. I was surrounded by highly creative and proactive people. They provide you will all needed equipment even if it is a student position. I went to the office a couple of times only because I had classes on campus and wanted to do some work done. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. good work space and culture Great communication Good flexibility of hours Clear expectations and helpful seniors - Excellent colleagues - Meaningful work - Wonderful location in the beautiful Tampa Bay Like any Graduate research assistant, my experience at USF has been great since it comes with paid tuition, and health benefits. I am not a part of the graduate student union as well but the university has one that you could join for more possible benefits. They are clear what the pay is for GAs which is very nice for financial budgeting. The work is great for me and not too exhausting but that is very dependent on who your advisor is.

Loved working here! The Florida Center for Nursing is very unorganized and isn't needed. I was hired through USF and discovered that this non-profit was separate from the school within my first week. The hiring process is deceptive, as you're unaware that this is a startup. I had to assist with other tasks outside my graphic designer role. I was mistreated due to my age and asked when I graduated college, although it was listed on my resume and should have been considered before hiring me. Only about five people are managing this organization, and most have yet to learn what they are doing. ""Leadership"" (comprised of one person) is being paid way too much while paying new hires less money to help the organization get started, which requires a ton of work. ""Leadership"" questioned me multiple times about whether I felt comfortable working from home. I was only asked this numerous times because they believed I wouldn't get any work done, although I had fast turnaround times with my previous tasks. There's no real office space, so you'll be cramped in one room and a window of 3 people. Work elsewhere if you want to grow as a graphic designer and be paid fairly. None Maybe the graduate student pay can be hire not much con. very flexible Student hour limitations Being limited to school schedule - Salaries could be higher, as is typical in higher education As a master's student, i get paid significantly less. That does not make any sense to me. I would enter as a pHd student and leave early if you want a master's. Low pay compared to some other schools None cons. It was a good experience lots of down time with nothing to doNo cons. Loved working here! The Florida Center for Nursing is very unorganized and isn't needed.

(Obviously this depends on the role) - Your assigned project(s) can be either exciting or boring based on the customer(s) you're supporting. (Pretty standard for any delivery engagement though) 401K isn’t great to be honest. - Everything is tracked in gsheet trackers that are manually managed leaving huge room for error and inconsistency sprawl as well as a cruel amount of time spent in sheets - All of the advertised Inclusion and best places to work and stats that are touted and forced on you are highly over inflated - Leadership is highly lacking in any ability to coach and develop their people for growth and retention. Any enablement, learning or professional skills growth is left to the employee to do on their own. The drowning people are thrown a manual on swimming & sprayed with a firehose vs helped to shore and taught to swim. - If in sales - highly unlikely to achieve or over achieve - the quotas are double the industry growth average and have been unattainable this year and last - For the field teams more than 75% time is spent on internal tasking vs customer facing or focused - Inability to be flexible and offer contracts that are right for the customer and what they are asking for Not a lot of training for a junior new hire in my 1st year, more of a ""sink or swim"" experience, which can be fun or stressful depending on your perspective. There have been een a lot of changes internally but I think they're good ones, just creates a bit of commotion. Leadership has a hard time focusing, switches strategies before the rest of the org can finish rolling out the previous, and the operational focus is essentially nil within marketing. Very little operational enablement and documentation, poor communication amongst marketing teams, and lack of strong middle management leadership in specific roles within marketing causing a lot of wasted cycles which leads to burnout of the most dedicated and talented team members. the turnover is insane. i know people, myself include that had over 8-10 managers over a few years. no one is happy. everyone is over worked, and wins are not celebrated. it is all about management and the leadership just cares about making as much money as possible at all costs. they put people in 'people management' positions that should have NEVER been managers and is the definition of a political environment. they had / have multiple abusive managers and it was documented and HR did nothing. they do not care about you as a human - you are a number to them. if you only care about making a lot of money but have 0 WLB and insane, abusive managers this place is for you! if not, STAY THE HELL AWAY. Was there for over four years and the things I saw out of management are absolutely disgusting. People forced into jobs they have no background and management tells them.. if you need help, your are an adult and a professional go find it yourself.. REALLY?!? Took a bunch of people and put them in a position they had no business being in. And then when they went to apply for their old jobs were told that according to your last review, you are prohibited you from applying?!? What kind of rat race you running here Nikesh and BJ?!? Palo has a long and complicated process for requesting a raise. Many senior managers support raises for their employees and the requested amount is in the range for the employee's experience, but the bureaucracy at the company slows down or stops the process. This makes it difficult to incentivize and reward great performance. Hard to connect with people remotely Not much I have as an con to describeThese aren't really cons since they're standard for most jobs. - Getting your foot in the door is extremely difficult.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/ASML-Reviews-E5781.htm,"A good job is something that provides 1) autonomy, 2) complexity, and 3) a direct connection between effort and reward. ASML provides all that. ASML shows autonomy by letting employees do remote work (if applicable). The work is complex and interesting by it's very nature - we are building highly complicated machines. Lastly, ASML provides reward for good effort in numerous ways, such as the reward programs (points which can be converted into gift cards), salary raises that go beyond inflation, etc. As an engineer or scientist, if you develop an experiment or test plan and need money, there's very little pushback for ordering equipment or tests. And, ASML is fond of letting engineers and scientists stay as engineers or scientists - it's the managers deal with the political conversations such as headcount, budgeting, etc. Engineers and scientists can stay technical without wearing many hats. Lastly, ASML company culture is very family friendly. Managers and co-workers are very understanding when time is needed for doctors appointments, or if childcare falls through, etc. High salary with yearly bonus usually paying more than expected. 15 vacation days per year with roll over. 10 sick days per year plus roll over. Christmas break shutdown fully paid without requiring PTO usage. ASML is working on some cutting edge research and is a leader in the semiconductor equipment space. The products we will be delivering and projects are very interesting and very groundbreaking research , development, production is done here. I definitely enjoy the work and technical aspect of the projects. 3 weeks PTO + 2 weeks sick time. Highlight your role in the project and what is it about that project that you’re especially proud of. people are friendly not stressed No pros at all, a complete disaster and a reprehensible company! Smart colleagues, interesting technology, not bad to start your career -ASML is a solid company, profit sharing is good -Okay benefits and pay (better than for the average person but the worst of the few tech companies I’ve worked for) -I don’t have anything good to say about HMI, probably okay if you’ve never worked anywhere else or are fluent in MandarinA good job is something that provides 1) autonomy, 2) complexity, and 3) a direct connection between effort and reward.

ASML needs more headcount - and they are hiring all the time - but there is so much work to do! Field site can have resourcing challenges. Customer support is very demanding and pressure can be intense. There are no notable cons. Don’t recommend this place if you’re young and a woman and looking to feel included. I am 100% on site for reference. It’s already a male dominated field as is but I feel like the work culture lacks in female empowerment and support here and also for young people to feel included. Feels like an old boys club for the most part and you will get spoken over by other men constantly. My imposter syndrome has been really bad at this job and it’s affecting my mental health and I feel very lonely and isolated. Lacks in amenities on site and company culture and other companies offer more competitive salaries for less stressful work and a smaller workload, giving me less of an incentive to stay here long term. Can’t speak for all parts of the company but this is how I feel at the Wilton location and my role and work life balance is poor. There’s not much opportunity for professional growth or attending outside conferences and the hierarchy for engineers is very flat for the most part. Management is also dismissive and poor regarding employees feelings rather than supportive and motivating. Over worked. You try to get 1 thing done and you need 4 approvals from different departments who ignore you, yet your deadline is still the same to get the job done. Management doesn't listen nor has common sense. If you're good at kissing people's behind more than getting work done, then this is the place for you.

Working for HMI is rough. Most of the people who enjoy working for HMI have not ever worked for another company and/or are fluent in Mandarin. -If you do not speak Mandarin, you are treated like an outsider and do not have access to the same knowledge and training as those who do. If you find yourself struggling to learn or understand things because of this, you’ll be treated as though you are incompetent or lazy as opposed to experiencing very real and significant language barriers. -Work life balance is generally not good. It seems to be an expectation of the Taiwanese workers to work 10-12 hour days 7 days a week. If you protest this grueling and completely unreasonable schedule, your reputation will be negatively affected. There is no work life balance drafted into policy and therefore it is abused (e.g. it is not written policy that workers who go above 40 hours can take comp time, which is something other companies do to avoid these types of abuses, nor is it written in that there are paid or required breaks). HR policies need to be more robust to protect workers, they are the least clear/protective of any company I have worked for in this industry. -The level of chaos and disorganization is astonishing. It is an accepted part of the culture that training and documentation is extremely low quality. Specs are not well studied or understood. Something being “good” is often completely subjective. Couple this with a language barrier and it is not difficult to see why there is a lack of quality for products and installation in general. This company does not have a quality mindset and yet blames individuals for its systemic failures. -The long term strategy seems like it is to wing it and make it work. When you work in an industry that is reliant on consistency, quality, and data driven decisions, it is no surprise HMIs customers are frequently unhappy. It makes it even more difficult as a first line engineer to feel the wrath first line and be blamed for strategic and quality failures that come from factory and management. -Most of the people in senior positions have been there a long time. They have no concept of what things are really like in a fab or ebeam experience other than what they know from HMI and they expect people to follow orders. Some of the technical aspects of the tool are simply incorrect because there is no diversity of thought or experience, or they are sloppily designed that make it difficult to use because there is no forethought. If you have suggestions to change something you need to know the right person and even then it goes into a black hole. From typos to misnomers to bugs, it’s a mess. -They hire a lot of PhDs who don’t have much practical experience and not many people with actual semiconductor fab/process experience. There’s a lot of arrogance and arrogance is the bane of good engineering. Most of the time, people cannot give you a good coherent answer as to why they designed something a certain way. It’s disappointing to see ASML comment on these complaints and requesting people to escalate these things individually. There is a lack of accountability across the board.

If you protest this grueling and completely unreasonable schedule, your reputation will be negatively affected. There is no work life balance drafted into policy and therefore it is abused (e.g. it is not written policy that workers who go above 40 hours can take comp time, which is something other companies do to avoid these types of abuses, nor is it written in that there are paid or required breaks). HR policies need to be more robust to protect workers, they are the least clear/protective of any company I have worked for in this industry. -The level of chaos and disorganization is astonishing. It is an accepted part of the culture that training and documentation is extremely low quality. Specs are not well studied or understood. Something being “good” is often completely subjective.

I take Metro, and I am able to get to work on time 90% of the time, but the fact that you sometimes have only 30 minutes to get to work makes this difficult. The phone line and general response by the LAUSD headquarters is dismal. Sometimes it takes over an hour to talk to someone at the Substitute Teacher unit. Not good. Very rarely, in fact, in my experience, only once, the administration of the school can throw their weight around and be rude and unprofessional towards substitutes. Not all schools have the same culture, everywhere you will be a different setting There can be a lot of stress around keeping your job; based on student enrollment. The bureaucracy is overwhelming. It can be difficult to get things done. The pay is low. It is hard to make a living on a teacher's salary. The turnover rate is high.
