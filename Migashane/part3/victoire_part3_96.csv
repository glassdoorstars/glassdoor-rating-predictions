I had no idea what to expect with this position and knew I wanted to try something new and step out of my comfort zone. I ended up being on the greatest team with people who truly worked hard and had goals they wanted to achieve. The structure of the first role is conducive to life in your 20s which is a nice transition. I am looking forward to exploring more positions within the company- as there are a LOT. Overall great experience with TTI and I know there are great opportunities ahead! -Company F-150 (branded) that you can use for personal travel -Gas card -7am-3:30pm 40-hour work week. -Standard benefits (medical, dental, 401k) The whole reason to work for TTI as a sales and marking rep is to get promoted out of the Home Depot. It’s supposed to be temporary position to really learn about the business, but because they hired on so many reps there’s not enough positions out there. They are also now taking away our company trucks and giving us a car allowance that barely covers the price of car insurance, not including adding gas or car payments. The role is just not worth sweating in the Home Depot anymore. *Opportunity to travel *Develop skills to leverage for an outside sales role *Truck (its branded) but free gas and can use for personal use. *International opportunities (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Canada, Hong Kong, Vietnam) -If you are interested in working internationally, TTI is a great opportunity.

However, if you can suck it up and grind, you have will have a great opportunity to move into outside sales with Milwaukee, supply chain in Vietnam, Corporate in HK, management in whatever state is available etc. Salary will be comparatively low across many companies in my opinion. Nevertheless, a decent job right after college. Very easy, very lax, easy money, pretty easy to promote if you want to leave. You don't bring any work with you home. Once you're out, you're out. You get the experience and the company looks good on a resume. Fun work environment when you get to collaborate on projects with your peers when you get to meet them. Very self driven giving you the ability to be flexible with the store you work in. Some of the greatest people you could hope to work with. The folks in engineering were driven towards the same goal. Regardless of team or project focus, everyone maintained a positive outlook and worked hard to design and lead projects into production. None, the company is run on lies.

It’s supposed to be temporary position to really learn about the business, but because they hired on so many reps there’s not enough positions out there. They are also now taking away our company trucks and giving us a car allowance that barely covers the price of car insurance, not including adding gas or car payments. The role is just not worth sweating in the Home Depot anymore. *Opportunity to travel *Develop skills to leverage for an outside sales role *Truck (its branded) but free gas and can use for personal use. *International opportunities (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Canada, Hong Kong, Vietnam) -If you are interested in working internationally, TTI is a great opportunity. The entry level of an EMS or FSMR will be mundane and you will be a glorified Home Depot associate. However, if you can suck it up and grind, you have will have a great opportunity to move into outside sales with Milwaukee, supply chain in Vietnam, Corporate in HK, management in whatever state is available etc. Salary will be comparatively low across many companies in my opinion. Nevertheless, a decent job right after college. Very easy, very lax, easy money, pretty easy to promote if you want to leave. You don't bring any work with you home. Once you're out, you're out. You get the experience and the company looks good on a resume. Fun work environment when you get to collaborate on projects with your peers when you get to meet them. Very self driven giving you the ability to be flexible with the store you work in. Some of the greatest people you could hope to work with. The folks in engineering were driven towards the same goal. Regardless of team or project focus, everyone maintained a positive outlook and worked hard to design and lead projects into production. None, the company is run on lies. The head of Human Resources is the head of sales and will lay people off with no severance.Promote from within, ambitious culture, hands on experience I chose this job for the convience and the actual opportunity as a starting position. Also because of the company vehicle and gas provided. I also felt that this position would allow me to use my sales skills. strict 40hr work week, insurance, relocation opportunities. I had no idea what to expect with this position and knew I wanted to try something new and step out of my comfort zone. I ended up being on the greatest team with people who truly worked hard and had goals they wanted to achieve.

TTI's Field Sales and Marketing Representative position is a great opportunity for individuals starting their careers. I am currently employed by TTI and have enjoyed my experience with the company thus far.

Overall, this position offers a strong foundation for future success within TTI and the professionally as a whole. -85% of employees who I meet/worked with were phenomenal people and pools of knowledge in the industry -You gain much experience in numerous aspects of the retail and business environment(Marketing, Operations, Sales, and Operational Rhythm) -Most employees at all levels started in the first position and worked their way up, although changes have been made, commitment to the company rewards in future opportunities.

I would say you are spending 80% of the time Merchandising and trying to convince Walmart management and 20% selling to customers. I personally did not enjoy this ratio because it does not give me the opportunity to use the skills I believe would excel me in this company. So the metrics that higher ups look at are up to the cooperation and the care of Walmart employees, which isn't very reliable. As of this past week, the company has discontinued company vehicles and are no longer giving gas cards, instead giving money to compensate which I think is not enough considering the costs of making payments, insurance , and mantainance. lastly, the higher ups in this position have not came up from HART rather the other brands like Milwaukee, Ryobi, etc... The reason this is an issue is because they do not understand the struggles that a HART Rep has to deal with vs a Milwaukee Rep. Because of this the expectations for a HART employee are overwhelming (referring back to paragraph one) - They are getting rid of the employee vehicle and gas card - Stuck in a home depot all day expected to stock shelves and change price labels - Little to no growth opportunities unless you are willing to relocate anywhere nationwide - Divisional and territory managers are way too young and super under qualified for the positions they hold - Zero culture and always working alone, you will see another team member maybe once every month or two - Extremely high turnover, after being in my role for over a year I've had 5 different managers and 30+ different team members in a territory with 10 positions -Lack of honesty and integrity. Interns are required to post and provide proof to recruiters of a positive glass door review to outweigh all the real negative reviews - Lack of job stability, every year or so TTI will perform a purge and lay off around a third of their field reps -Monotony. The actual job itself could be performed by a 16 year old, with most people getting burned out after just a few months - IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO RELOCATE DO NOT TAKE THIS POSITION! YOU WILL NEVER GET PROMOTED! Some of the internship projects were more difficult to follow. I also was the only intern on my team for the first month which was challenging in a good way, but it would have been nice to be paired up with another intern. I really cannot say anything negative about my experience thus far. It’s been the best challenge! -YOU ARE A glorified Home Depot/Walmart Associate. Don't let other reviews tell you otherwise. About a 50/50 chance your store likes you or hates your guts the first day you start. -Promotions are impossible to obtain unless you live in a huge market AND suck up big time to upper management. They will lie to you and say 6 months to a year and your promoted HAHA no. -Other reviews mentioning fraternity/sorority culture are 100% right. Management will be full of people the same age or even YOUNGER than you and will have high expectations while knowing nothing at the same time. -They lie... a lot. One example is the company telling us back in the fall that they won't be doing any layoffs... one month later they laid off 100's of reps (If you're looking at the EMS role you have NO job security.) -You're not valued. Treated more as a robot than a human being. Successes are brushed over while you'll be scolded for sending an email with the wrong formatting. It's very demoralizing. -If you're in college ready to graduate or even fresh out considering TTI, I would advise you to look elsewhere, especially if you have a degree. It will be of no use here. -Working in a Home Depot -Impossible to get promoted -Company vehicle getting taken away *Limited opportunity to move up unless you are OK with moving. *Pay is alright, unless you have more valuable skills it's a decent gig right out of college. *Management is young, high expectations for working at a home depot. *Senior management is significantly older, conservative, not down with long hair (on men), tattoos will be looked down on, etc (Even if you kill it, you will be judged on the way you look - Could potentially impact promotion opportunities.) *They send a lot of stuff to your house, like A LOT. *You don't get any free tools really, you get discounts on Ryobi but no Milwaukee. Can become draining and repetitive at times. Movement up the company ladder is there when it becomes available but who knows when or where that'll be. You may get pretty dirty and dusty from the work you put in but if that doesn't bother you then full steam ahead. Most glaring issues seemed to be lack of sales and poor direction on future product development. Products were frequently determined at the last minute or with multiple design changes after tooling had already been completed. Coupled with the rush to get to market, the general culture of the company was you were always behind the 8-ball with regards to schedule and with no significant time to focus on product quality and reliability. Please do not join this company. I was promoted but they promote people that do nothing based on how they look. Managers will sit in their cars trying to catch you doing something wrong and Hr backs them. Also most of these reviews are fake as the ceo makes every promoted person submit them.

As of this past week, the company has discontinued company vehicles and are no longer giving gas cards, instead giving money to compensate which I think is not enough considering the costs of making payments, insurance , and mantainance. lastly, the higher ups in this position have not came up from HART rather the other brands like Milwaukee, Ryobi, etc... The reason this is an issue is because they do not understand the struggles that a HART Rep has to deal with vs a Milwaukee Rep. Because of this the expectations for a HART employee are overwhelming (referring back to paragraph one) - They are getting rid of the employee vehicle and gas card - Stuck in a home depot all day expected to stock shelves and change price labels - Little to no growth opportunities unless you are willing to relocate anywhere nationwide - Divisional and territory managers are way too young and super under qualified for the positions they hold - Zero culture and always working alone, you will see another team member maybe once every month or two - Extremely high turnover, after being in my role for over a year I've had 5 different managers and 30+ different team members in a territory with 10 positions -Lack of honesty and integrity.

This change was made despite the fact the company made record profits during the time almost everyone was working from home. CEO Rick Mckenney refused to answer questions about the changes during a company-wide meeting. He doesn’t make any attempt to hide his ambivalence toward the peons. They’re citing some third party studies as the catalyst for the change but refuse to provide this data for employee review. It’s obvious that Unum is taking advantage of this period of economic instability to do what they do best: force out talent so they can rehire the roles at a fraction of the pay. The pay is already absurdly low here, but if Unum could outsource all of its positions to India and still function, they’d do it in a heartbeat.In recent months Unum has doubled down on its flex policy (work from home 3 days/in office 2 days a week) and will start tracking and reporting to managers when employees badge in/out of the office. The in-office requirement is positioned as a collaborative/engagement play but it feels like there are more reasons not being articulated...perhaps an outdated way of thinking about work and a desire for greater control. Given the record year Unum had in 2022, this position feels tone deaf to the trends in the working world. The empty office buildings show that the desire of many of its employees is to work from home. In office work, some flexibility At times, claim volumes can become extremely overwhelming with no changes to metrics. Can feel you are set up to fail when there are no adjustments made to relieve pressure and stress off of specialists when we are receiving up to 7 new claims a week. Customers can be very mean with name calling and threats. Should be more protection for employees to not have to tolerate being spoken to in such a manner. The point system that’s in place…..it makes it so hard to not feel guilty about being sick or having emergencies. Pay is not as high as it should be for the stress of the job Average pay, large caseload, working in office There seems to be a disconnect between the developers and the infrastructure engineers. It would be nice to have a change coordinate to announce new technical products They talk a lot about inclusion and diversity as well as accessibility but they do not back it up at all! The favoritism is running rampant and that paired with random layoffs of groups of employees without explanation, the near constant changing goal posts in production employee's daily expectations, and refusal to pay out complete PBI +rate increases to individuals in spite of the company's board determination make this a place to avoid if you're looking for long term success. Earlier this year they decided to discriminate against remote workers. Unum offered remote jobs then decided that if you were a remote worker you would be last considered for promotions or other opportunities. Preference would be given to in office employees. Now after working remote for 5 years they are revoking their work from home agreements. If you live within 50 miles of an office you have to go in.

Despite this drawback, I found the job to be a great opportunity for gaining practical experience in the restaurant industry. The team was supportive and the work atmosphere was pleasant. However, potential applicants should be aware that the lack of benefits may impact long-term job satisfaction. Overall, I would recommend this job for those seeking valuable experience, but it is important to consider the absence of benefits in your decision-making process. Nothing really stood out as a con, except maybe that management was a bit too strict on appearances, even when you couldn’t be seen by customers, like in the kitchen or when doing dishes. - racist managers and leads (assign tasks that everyone would do but much more then they would) - i was a minor and they kinda took advantage of that (would yell at me for not clocking out before the minor curfew and would yell at me if i was clocking out on curfew time or after curfew time. but much more to it.) - yell at me for any and everything - be mad if i didn't know something - be mad if i didn't ask questions - they had me employed as a cashier but made me be a runner (take orders to cars) - was asked to be a robot and not do anything when there was no work. - friend who used to work there said one of the managers was a creep to girls. - honestly so prone to quit not gonna lie. Minimum wage, hours were consistently cut in the wintertime even though new people were constantly being hired, management was poor, and employee growth was prolonged. No health insurance is offered. Some coworkers talk more than they work Mistakes are difficult to correct without managers having to put in their pin Lots of standing in one place for long periods of time Managers/owners often talk about the restaurant breaking profit records but also cut people’s hours like crazy to save money which is very discouraging. Restaurant gets extremely busy throughout the day which can make the job quite stressful. It sometimes feels like the owner expects too much out of us for the amount we’re paid. Seems like employees are promoted based on favorites instead of actual experience. Restaurant currently has a really bad issue with flies and nothing seems to be done about it. This place is too popular so you’re always busy and I’ve worsened my diet coke addiction. Guest were sometimes rude for no reason. After the old GM (General Manager) left they pulled someone from a different town. They changed everything in the building without notice and one of the managers they brought over is very micromanaging. It seems they care more about appearance then their employees. Over 20 people have quit in the last 2 months and more plan to do so. The reviews online show that within the last few months something is different. The new managers don't listen to people's concerns and reasons. They only care about getting the job done, not really about employee's joy working at the job or the customers.low pay and required uniform While my experience working at this restaurant provided valuable skills and a positive work environment, it is important to note that the job did not offer benefits.

Almost every role at the company would benefit from a remote/hybrid system, but execs seem to be attached to the old-ways. Quiet-layoffs abundant when they force remote employees back, seems obvious that they want mass-quitting as a response to it to avoid yet another public layoff. Micromanagement is pretty strong, but could easily be case by case by manager. Not sure if these eyes-over-shoulders approaches are passed down from the executives or not, but they don't seem to trust employees very much. The constant change is exciting but creates uncertainty that can be unsettling. National HQ is struggling with the current economy (real estate is difficult) and has goals to appease investors that are causing frustration and mistrust among employees CEO has zero respect for the employees, and only cares about the client - the agents. But he can’t seem to realize that we employees are the ones who keep the clients happy every day. And if we aren’t happy, and supported, and given the most basic respect… no one is happy. Requiring us to be in the office ever workday just for optics is stupid, rude, and a waste of everyone’s time and resources. If it’s that important to you to “build culture,” pay it - don’t say it. Most of us are on year 3 or more without a raise that even begins to make up for inflation, and you just keep demanding more from us. We’re promised support in our career growth, but there is no growth available, much less support. Do better, Robert.

Everything revolves around the agents and upper management will let the agents get away with being rude and disrespectful. The CEO and upper management have an old school backward mindset. There is a serious lack of diversity, don't let the biracial CEO fool you. During your interview, they might try telling you about the amazing ""culture"" Compass has and how great of a company it is to work at but there is so much work to be done to get it to be what Compass used to be.

Remaining staff are expected to take on more work with no additional pay. Arbitrary in-office requirements for staff who should work 100% remote by industry standards. The toxic positivity & fear-driven culture embodied by management is truly the cherry on top of dealing with entitled agents who are never held accountable for their often belittling & discriminatory behavior. I’m not even sure where to start with the lack of diversity... You can already imagine who makes up the majority of luxury home clientele & the agents who represent them. This is reflected among staff as well. Don’t be fooled by the biracial CEO - the real face of Compass is white, conventionally attractive & wealthy.
