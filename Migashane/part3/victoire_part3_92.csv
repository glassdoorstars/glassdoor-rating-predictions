This is just my experience, but I just felt like it was hot mess in the auto side of the business. My boss left to a different team on my first week, my team was all remote but didn't really desire to connect at all. I had no direction for the first 5 months, I didn't do anything for the first 5 months because getting access to systems took forever. I was told to work on user stories but then was told that most of them would never see the light of day unless they were business critical. My team wasn't super helpful in explaining how to get access to systems or even explaining how things were done for X system, request, process, .etc. I left at 6 months because I was so bored and checked out. I will say that we did get a new manager in the my last two months of working and he seemed like a great guy and thought he was going ot be a solid leader for the team but I was too bored/annoyed to see if that would go anywhere. Not everyone in the office will smile at you. There are definitely a mix of people, but more good than bad. Very low level on the totem pole. Kind of hard to get ahead. Easy to fall behind. Don't let that stop you though. Learn skills outside the office for more opportunities. Salary is not competitive compared to others in industry Hybrid work model with 3 days in office. The ONLY con I can think of, which is actually just a preference, there is a lot of change in this industry. I just happen to LOVE change. It means bigger and better things, and screams opportunity! Not any I can think of. It is collections. To do well you have to grind. Not very structured when i first arrivedNone at the moment to talk about.

You try to express a willingness to learn with interest in moving up but unfortunately there seems to be a road block and those opportunities to progress are available to us all who want to to continue to move further with the company. I’m currently working with someone who as been less time, but is being treat significantly better than I am & is paid significantly more. Despite my time here with the company & experience. My store manager constantly lies to us about things & has even pushed out 2 other employees one of which Irvin begged to transfer here immediately but was transferred to another store just as fast and out into the stores lowest position because he was asking questions about how certain things were being done because of the lack of store manager supporting us in running the store and trying to bring to my store manager’s attention about how myself and our other employees were feeling because we were/are treated as unfairly & told to apply else where WHENEVER there was a concern being brought up. 26 year veteran and I earn less than $2 more per hour than entry level pay. I do all jobs in store from deliveries to store manager duties. training is pitiful. Employees are expected to set up and service products with no training, resources, or even sometimes unrepairable products. Product can weigh in excess of 200lbs and delivery can be difficult and unsafe and collecting used product can be hazardous and again no training for those types of situations. Free bed bugs with every purchase! I worked for Rent-A-Center in May and June of 2023. Anyone who has purchased from this location is risking adopting an infestation of BED BUGS! The BEDBUGS and COCKROACHES have taken over the backrooms of this store and have been seen inside the furniture by multiple employees. This problem is known! Yet they are still here casually selling their at-risk merchandise to unsuspecting customers. I recently refused to continue working at Rent-A-Center until they exterminated their infestations. I told the manager this on June 18, 2023. These BED BUGS have been in the store for MONTHS! These BED BUGS have also infested another employees house and they're still there after weeks! Honestly the level of disrespect for the customers, merchandise, and employees here is unmatched. NONE OF THIS WAS TOLD TO ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS! Now it is June 28, 2023 and have NO WORD back from the manager on site. Complete and total ghosting after she asked if I would come back to work if the bugs were gone. All my inquiries about the BED BUGS and coming back have been met with complete silence. Do not buy here. Do not come here. If you bought here and you have bugs call Rent-A-Center and have them send a bug exterminator to your location. For all the good it has done for my fellow employee... Return your items before you catch them. We can all imagine what can happen after months of BED BUGS colonizing a local rental store. Hours, Work/Life Balance, PTO use, ""Do this or else"" mentality, Broken promises Work load can be hefty at times, expectations can be unreachable at times as well. For yearly raises…. They could be better. The opportunity to grow isn’t really there. Or maybe I’m just in the shadow of my manager. Dental and vision suck. The employee purchase program could be better. There’s a mark up for putting things on rent and I definitely feel that could be lower. Sense of belonging Unrealistic Goals Forced to Harass customers Over worked for compensation 6 days a week , retail hours , delivery’s and pickups They let men who sexually harass women run the company Having to repo past die merchandiseThings have stabilized but the company has gone through leadership and org changes over the past few months which is always hard since this translates into business strategy changes Very dynamic company which can make it hard at time to keep up, also the expected turnaround time on requests can be very short too Biggest down side is that after working for the company for over 5 yrs it seems as though the title of assignment manger seems irrelevant once you get moved around a few stores, even after discussing things about improving staffing and handling accounts with consistency with a store manager and DM together you end up getting moved and put back to the lowest position in store.

WFH is an option, depending on workloads and job roles. 17 paid holidays a year, 10 of which are weeklong summer and winter shutdowns. +80 hours of PTO a year, plus added flex time. Honda R&D also has an employee amateur race team. Think SAE, but with production race cars. Flexible time off, competitive pay, yearly bonus Good Company takes care of its Employees Very laid back , and easy The plant looks new. There are opportunities for overtime. Pay scale seems to be 90% wages, with the remaining 10% as a yearly bonus that depends on sales. Amazing company, great support, growth opportunity Collaborative and helpful coworkers and bosses -Very easy company to onboard with fresh out of college -Job stability -Interesting work environment -Lots of opportunity for travel Amazing co-workers, decent benefits, very laid back","i haven’t found any yet The drive sucks.

Cloud virtual machines have very limited access to internet. No access to Office 365 from external machines. - Company says it engages in affirmative action in hiring and promoting -- possibly discriminating based on race. I cannot say for sure they do. Unfortunately, as long as bad managers remain, talented individuals will continue to depart. By bad managers, I refer to those in senior leadership positions who display a complete lack of respect for the skills of those who report both directly and indirectly to them; who merely order rather than doing any of the work for which they take credit; who provide resources (professional development opportunities, travel dollars, etc.) only to their favored minions; and who fail to support/have the back of their associates in any circumstance. Rather, they are solely concerned with hanging onto their titles and integrating themselves with their C-level bosses. TU does not care about employees. We are underpaid especially with inflation. Long term loyal employees are neglected. You know, the ones who helped build this company up. And have institutional knowledge that can’t be replaced. There is no growth. And those same hard working employees get zero recognition (except for more work!!!). The current deploy into the new SalesForce system has been horrible. Built without any input from actual users. Round peg meet square hole. We acquire companies and can’t integrate. The biggest con is they've developed a culture of overwork and burnout. I was working 60+ hours a week and was still drowning in work. I often had 20-30 hours of meetings a week in addition to 100 emails a day, even even i was off. Because of this I had no vacation for over 2 years (don't let the flex time off fool you). I asked for help and head count and was denied. When describing my level of burnout to my manager a few months after the request for help, I was told ""well, we're all busy."" The pay is not great and they absolutely hosed everyone on bonuses this year. You're locked into tiny merit increases unless you have a competitive offer, but at that point you should leave. There is no manager development, so there are people leaders who don't have the skills to develop and guide their teams. They also aren't cultivating future leaders. HR exec came from Walmart, a company not know for their employee-focus, and that worries a lot of people. Multiple acquisitions occured without proper vetting or the experience to handle them, leaving many departments on clean-up duty. Offshoring in cheaper labor markets so not sure of long-term job stability. Benefits are tanking fast. The prices are going up and the coverage (especially for prescriptions and women’s health) have gone WAY down and get worse every year. The messages that say they care about associate well-being get old when health coverage is such an afterthought. Salaries aren’t on par with other organizations. They’re low for how “lean” TU runs vs. the amount of work expected from each associate. If you question it, managers will tell you it’s more than you’d make somewhere else, but it’s not the case.

I have not encounter one so far. Extremely toxic work environment with a business model of burning out staff & corps members and then kicking them out. Leadership has no real experience in development but makes unilateral decisions for the development team, making our jobs harder. Workload distribution is extremely inequitable--there are way too many ""strategy"" leaders who have been promoted to the level of their incompetence, and not nearly enough real workers to execute on that strategy. Major overhauls of the org structure every year means top talent has fled, and there isn't enough time to learn from last year's restructure before a new one occurs. The result is an unstable mess with no real direction, and the corps members suffer for it more than anyone. There was once a time when TFA was a great resume-builder, the perfect place to start a successful career; now, it's completely irrelevant and struggling to stay afloat because leadership has run it into the ground. TFA is an aging former prom queen who peaked in high school and is in denial that her glory days were decades ago. It's embarrassing. 1. Be prepared to work in some tough schools that are low performing. 2. Traditional teachers can be a pain to deal with because they do not always understand Alternative route teaching companies like TFA. 3. This might be one of the best yet HARDEST careers you can choose. 4. There are weekends and nights spent creating lessons and working on projects for your students. (The basically never ends lol) 5. The pay can be very low depending on your placement region. They will tell you nothing. You do not get paid until MONTHS after you start. You do not know where in your city you will move until a month in advance. People forget your meeting times and there is no 9-5. You will be kept behind or expected to wait. No one answers phone calls. Unprofessional. Took me two months to officially get removed after I quit. They kepy sending me private information via email even after I emailed multiple times that I would like to be removed. I ended up blocking the company emails to protect their privacy. In group mes with the rest of the future members, I was shocked to see people paying unexpected fees and being concerned about being unable to afford working at this job. Very little room for upward mobility. This was the worst experience that I have ever had in a working environment, and it has taken me several years to be ready to talk about it. I had never experienced racism or any kind of discrimination in a job before I got to TFA Washington, and it was constant from the executive leadership to every level of the staff. I was referred to as slurs, bullied constantly, retaliated against for reporting to HR, and told by our executive leadership that I should be more patient and willing to teach people about racism because they deserved to be able to learn. I reported every instance of harassment that was happening to me over 2 years, and nothing was ever done about it by the execs at TFA Washington or HR (called the ""people team"", funnily enough) at TFA National. It got to the point where I asked HR if they could send the TFA employee handbook around to my team, and they told me no they weren't even going to do that. In the end, I left TFA Washington because the people that I continuously reported to HR ended up being promoted, and I was the only person on the TFA Washington team and I'm sure that you can figure out why. I am still living with the effects of what those people did to me and will likely always bare that as a burden. It saddens me that an organization that claims to hold the values and principles it does would treat staff in this way, but it happens, and it will continue to happen because that's the type of place this is, and these are the type of people they hire. -- Additional programming while full-time employee can be overwhelming Your experience varies depending on the school you are in. Teaching is extremely difficult and the first year is always rough as you are learning on the job. Low pay. No union. Raises don't keep pace with inflation.The cons are few and far between for me, and they're changing the internal structure a lot so it might not be relevant but getting help from the national office was often a chore and a half!

Love the flexibility -Low commissions per sale. -Being forced to push back multiple times when a customer says no, so you are constantly having to annoy customers when they just came in to get a TV or a video game or something like that. - -Low hourly pay. -No medical benefits, no disability or any other insurance and or benefits, very low company match on 401k. -Training is inadequate. -Management is typically under qualified because so many people quit that they are basically just the last employee standing. -Only one discount for a wireless carrier and it is the lowest that I've seen at 17% off your bill. -You are in a Big Box environment (Walmart) which makes it more difficult to entice a customer to stop and discuss cell phones with you when all they want to do is get in and get out -Educating that we (Premium) is not a gimmick and Walmart is not just the burner phone store. Management has no idea what’s going on or even who they are in charge of. Every week I would have 4 different managers emailing me as if I was under them (I wasn’t). When I was hired we agreed upon a starting pay and within 3 weeks of working was told a new policy was in affect and would have to take a $4 pay cut. Mile age reimbursement is few and far between considering I would drive 150+ miles every day. Slim chances to move up, hardly hired from within. Company can’t be bothered to send shipping labels for returns, haven’t had any return labels for 6+ months now despite asking any and every manager I could contact. “Star Rating” system is inherently flawed and only punishes the most minor mistakes and ignores flawless work.

The company cannot restructure correctly, no merit raises, no flexibility, monotonous work, pathetic amounts of politics for a lonesome job, lack of support, no clear answers to sales-related questions that impact incentive pay.

Management has no idea what’s going on or even who they are in charge of. Every week I would have 4 different managers emailing me as if I was under them (I wasn’t).
