Great company to work for Great benefits and nice people and great training","Not as flexible sometimes in regards to remote I had worked in F&B at Bellagio in the 2010s and was excited to return. My excitement quickly turned to dismay when I felt the negativity and hostility at my place of employment. One person consistently made inappropriate remarks, telling me he'd buy a bottle of wine to help me gain weight. I put up with other demeaning and demoralizing comments from this person for the duration of my tenure, in addition to being slapped on the wrist while working in the capacity of a cashier. I can't believe I put up with this for four months of my life. There was also a major problem with bullying among staff. A coworker had to open a case through HR because of it and I was interviewed about it. I'd look elsewhere if you care about the industry, career progression, and your wellbeing. I felt truly uncomfortable here. One of the downsides of this company is the complex system and processes in place, which can be challenging to understand. It may take around six months before you feel comfortable navigating them efficiently. Additionally, the workload can be quite heavy, often leading to overtime work. While it is not forced, it can affect work-life balance. Another negative aspect is that the management team can be nit-picky when it comes to details, which can create additional pressure. Moreover, the company's hiring process and decision-making are relatively slow, which can be frustrating at times. Lastly, the promotion and raise cycle is not frequent, with the possibility of going several years without a promotion or salary increase. They don’t reward hard work and only give raises for cost of living but the raises are bare minimum. Upper level management only cares about themselves and don’t create a welcome environment Pay and benefits are the low end, and combined with a general unwillingness to hire enough management to adequately cover shifts, vacations, and life events, you are left with management that is spread very thin and with no hope of any meaningful work/life balance. It is a great opportunity for new managers to get a foot in the door, but experienced leaders are easily poached away to the competition. Employees could be treated beter *Being hired for certain days and having that change despite it being imperative and agreed upon prior to employment. * Unprofessional Highschool like behavior in some of the management on Dayshift. Not a lot of remote job opportunity’s, and during the pandemic I was required to get the vaccine which I didn’t like. This company makes MILLIONS and the pay could and should be better.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UCHealth-Reviews-E668641.htm,"I have been an ACP at the Anschutz inpatient pavilion since February. It has been an amazing experience. I've learned so much and the management is really flexible with scheduling around my school commitments. - Flexibility - Educational - Great work spaces - Beautiful campus - Supportive faculty - Wonderful teams Progressive thinking On the forefront of delivery Expanding Lots of Opportunity The benefits are great and most of the staff is really friendly. Great benefits including pension. Flexible working from home and hybrid options for this role. Great team to work with Great Benefits Great staff Educational opportunities Ability to change job titles Good benefits, although that may be changing in 2024. But currently we have good retirement options and a pension. They care about their employees Well known hospital. Good reputation PRN at staffing was a great job with great management. Management made the job a great experience.","Its a lot of work to take on during nursing school, but its worth it! - Stressful work loads - Difficult problems - Low pay (this seems better these days) Growing quickly, had to keep up We were very understaffed and overworked. Overall probably an issue with the field but it was particularly present at UCHealth The workload continues to increase for this team as the primary focus looks to be on how many more affiliates we can get in then system while keeping the IT resources thin. Not enough personnel to keep up with new EHR implementations let alone work on maintaining the existing locations. Lower pay than other organizations in the state and no room for negotiation if you are promoted. Just a standard rate increase. Raises are limited for merit increases due to a restructure of limiting top raises of 5% with most getting 3%. Working on a team of high performing staff makes it difficult with the new restrictions to get a raise that is worth putting in the effort because leadership is restricted in how many top merit increases they are allowed to give at the “role model” level. Work load sees no sign of decreasing and compensation has not kept up with inflation. pay not great Job includes tasks outside of job description Typical healthcare stuff--understaffed, many complain about wages although honestly, we are competitive for the area. Get floated a lot as an ACP A little large east to get lost in the numbers None. It's healthcare at a trauma 1 hospital. Outside of management, don't agree with how the hospital system handled the COVID vaccine. UCHealth needs to revise it's ethics board to include more diverse thought. Seemed way too narrow, and a lot of people walked out as a result in their northern region. Southern Colorado Region is better in this regard, but the way they treated some of their staff and pressured them was short sided, manipulative and plain idiotic. Again, nothing to do with those who don't make those decisions and everything to do with the powers at the top."

Company culture, CEO, most middle management is good, remote/hybrid work, lots of opportunities to move around","Sometimes people can be too nice and not give feedback Could be more open to professionals from other industries, who might have fresh perspective. It's a call center, so the turnover is going to be high. If you don't enjoy talking on the phone all day every workday, this is not the job for you. It can be very emotionally demanding at times. Also, I hear some of the health benefits are not that great, but at least you get them. Lateral movement is not facilitated by management. Your career is very much in your own hands. Changing jobs sometimes feels like changing companies. Departments are silos, IT is surrounded by a moat and a brick wall. Nothing that comes to mind none in particular has less vacation time then my job at morgan stanley New Accounts is the way to get in, but once in, get out! The 2 directors of new accounts, are awful. They brought i their own people and played favorites amongst them. They got rid of people that were good and drove others out that were knowledgeable. When asked for a training plan in order to understand what my team works on daily, I was told by senior management that there is ""no training guides for supervisors"" and that I have to ""grab the bull by the horns and learn it myself"". However when I hire someone in, I'm able to have them comply with a training guide that has proven to be helpful. However, I am expected to approach people that I HIRED to train me on what they do. Very Sink or Swim. Overall culture is great otherwise. No downsides to working here Can be low paying, old outdated systemsSometimes people can be too nice and not give feedback It's a call center, so the turnover is going to be high.
