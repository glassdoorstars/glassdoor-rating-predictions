https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinox-Reviews-E134448.htm,"Equinox constantly has the best personal training leads imaginable walking through their doors every day. You will make lots of money if you are good at changing lives through fitness. *Very Smart trainers work here and can help you start your brand *Teach you interesting techniques and how to fix movement patterns *Great way to network and build clientele not available. Consider before applying - Access to a well-maintained gym - An interesting member-base in Hollywood: lots of folks in entertainment - Tri-annual bonuses are nice, ramper bonuses are nice Great place to learn to be a better trainer in! Access to cool equipment, trendy new classes, and free and discounted CEUs for recertification. Fun Co-workers Great Networking Good facility Complimentary membership, pleasant environment and competitive pay if successful. great pay, good facilities, gym access, great coworkers It is a positive environment - Teach you sales techniques from the beginning and give you a really good base understanding of sales and the company. - You can use almost all of the Equinox clubs. - Take classes (not usually the primetime ones) and get some personal training from some of the trainers. - Discounts on training, pilates, retail, plus one spousal membership to one club for $140. - Some clubs (the one I worked at) have great culture and understanding between sales, management, front desk, trainers, group fitness, and maintenance. Some clubs... do not... - Can usually get a workout in on lunch breaks.","It's hourly. You've got to work for the high income. *Corporate uses the quantity over quality method for hiring and getting trainers in This often leads to a high turnover rate and a lack of clients being fed to new trainers *The environment has become a lot more stressful with the way leadership has been introducing and restricting what trainers can do *Trainers are supposed to only workout at their assigned location and can find difficulty venturing to other locations *EQX sells you on that you are the master of your own schedule but really you are not *The rookie trainers often do not get fed enough leads because of how much they are hiring people *A lot of great trainers have left since leadrship/managment/corporate has become more strict with how they want trainers to operate their time and schedule as well as EQX's pay revisement they had 1 year ago *Most trainers have one foot out the door so many new trainers start hearing the negative things about the company and how they treat the trainers and the Front Desk staff poor management communication and scheduling. Hiring process is exceedingly poor. Communication especially with regards to setting up interviews was bad, unlike any other. It took multiple back and forth communications spanning several days to set up a phone interview. On a scheduled time to call, the hiring manager never showed up or reached out. I had to initiate the conversation hours after, to which I received a reply the NEXT day. Also didn't receive an update to my application until 2 weeks after when I reached out by email. Reconsider before applying here. - After your initial hiring, you may be booked very few assessments for potential new clients by management - They hire too many trainers, which thins the pool of potential clients and does not incentivize employee retention - The distribution of potential new clients feels like a game of personal relationships with membership advisors and management, rather than equal distribution amongst the team - Despite Equinox being a luxury brand, it does not feel like the customer service is at a luxurious level. The very low amount a trainer gets paid compared to how much the client pays. Worst in the industry! Floor shift requirements make it hard to have a life on the weekend. Too many new trainers going after the same pool of clients who show up to the gym. Management not giving enough leads, or giving them to only certain trainers. Nepotistic manager Fail upwards to a toxic leadership hierarchy which then trickles down and affects employee morale Super competitive-They have too many trainers for the amount of members and more than half can't make a living. Turnover is crazy. Minimum wage when not in session and you're expected to be there all the time even when not clocked in. This is for the corporation of equinox as a whole, not specifically at the gym level. If you have a medical crisis, lets say you get diagnosed with cancer. If you are a pert time employee even if you have been at the company for years you will get no pay, no paid leave, no sick pay or leave you will be left out on the curb. Furthermore, the outside company Alight formerly Reed group, that equinox forces you to use to make a claim for leave of absence is horrific. They are archaic and not helpful navigating the extremely complicated system of asking for an UNPAID leave while you get CHEMOTHERAPY just for as they say ""job security"" aka so they don't give your job away while you fight cancer. So be prepared to never get sick or have anything come up medically if you work for this company because its a nightmare. Not as high of pay as you would expect from such a high class club - The clubs vary in management/leadership. Most club directors/managers are great. There are some who are not... - There are sometimes unrealistic expectations of sales goals and other sales people at other clubs have it way easier. Again, depends where you end up how easy it is going to be for you. - You will be expected to stay late after your 9 hour shift if there are any extra appointments or walkins. - HUGE fluctuation in signups depending on the time of year. This will affect your pay. - It's 5 days in person at the club, no exceptions. - Closeout (last 4 days at the end of every month) is 9a-9p. Sometimes would only be 3 days, but expect 4. I've stayed until 11:30p."

I have always done more work than some of my coworkers and have gone above and beyond with doing extra duties, student activities and coming early and staying late to get things done; it is nice to get rewarded for my work.

Pay is based on a variety of different components that may include student in-class test scores, STAAR results, observations, and/or student perception surveys.

Not really worth it if I was given a choice, but we get ""volun-told"" to do them. The behavior of students has gotten out of hand, probably because of the way the parents behave.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Discount-Tire-Reviews-E6632.htm,"Decent pay, great management, very well maintained equipment and tools provided by the company. Great opportunities for advancement in the company. Work functions thrown all the time, nice corporate kitchen, security guards always went above and beyond. he company has a strong reputation for promoting a positive and supportive work environment. This includes opportunities for career growth and advancement within the organization. Additionally, employees often appreciate the competitive compensation packages and benefits offered by the company, which can include health insurance, retirement plans, and employee discounts. Good for those who want to work hard. Build strength, good coworkers and management, great safety procedures. Flexible work schedule and some good benefits like access to a therapist and such for part timers. Get paid every week. Can make tips from air check. If you're in love with working with your hands and getting dirty then this is the job for you. You will meet a lot of people in your same position with your same passion and that alone makes the job really fun. The people are the main reason I stay and have enjoyed my time here and also the sick cars that do come in from time to time. Management team was welcoming and promote within. Was a fun work environment. Although it is hard work. Employee discounts on tires and wheels. Great company who takes care of their people Good people who care. Honest work. Great schedule, friendly work environment","Facial hair is not allowed. Must be clean shaven. Management- refused to listen to help implement a better work environment for the positions recruiting for. As well as special treatment to certain employees. Also, would state for years on end things would get better however just let things sit by the way side to where there was high-turn over and no retention. Never had weekly meetings with your own manager to go over stats, goals to set, etc. Hired anyone and everyone regardless of not being qualified. And then Regions would fire people for no reason. Nepotism within all regions/even corporate. No work life balance. Poor treatment from Regions and Corporate. Every region has different cliques in stores and Managers are not held accountable for their own metrics thus pushing the blame onto others. No accountability held. False information given. If you are not in the clique you are treated poorly. Regions would discriminate against those with disabilities, tattoos, hair color, etc. Managers did not want to open full-time Tire Tech positions as this would eat into their yearly salary. People can not live off 4-15 hours a week, and if you are liked then maybe you'd get more hours. While there are benefits to working at Discount Tire, there are also some potential downsides. The physically demanding nature of the job, which often involves lifting heavy tires and working in various weather conditions, can be challenging and tiring. The fast-paced environment during peak seasons might lead to high levels of stress and pressure to meet targets. Moreover, the repetitive tasks involved in tire installation and maintenance might not be intellectually stimulating for everyone. Does not pay enough. Tire Technicians work harder with less break from activity than many other jobs, but receive less than jobs like cashiers. Very physically demanding and have to work in rain, 100+ degrees or freezing especially if air check. The only complaints I would make is depending on your location think about the environment... It can get hot so staying hydrated is a must and when you first get hired except the tough love from your peers, working at Discount is like being on a sports team and you gotta except to have the coaches on your back trying to push you harder. They only want you to be the best you. The compensation isn't substantial until reaching management positions. The days can be long and tiring. None that I can think of Hot and cold weather conditions. Advancement is lightning fast or terribly slow. No in between"

None that I can think of","- this specific job is not enjoyable, but is meant to be a starting point - they don't really care about their employees depending on department - everything is very political There is no real opportunity for advancement. As a people manager I have been trying to get the same employee promoted from a L3 engineer to Senior Engineer for two years. His previous manager pushed for the same thing for two years. He has been ""next"" the whole time, but leadership just keeps coming up with reasons why we can't do it. I am constantly offering him support and appreciation so he doesn't quit, but we currently have a backlog of people deserving of promotions that continues to grow. Eventually they'll start leaving and it will cost significantly more to replace them. I advocate for them as a manager and will continue to do so, but I can't help but think about the fact that I'm never getting a promotion either. The company is investing heavily in AI, so probably layoffs in the next two years. Low pay compared to industry standard. Moving upwards in the company either involves a legal degree or being highly skilled in AI programming. - I really can not think of any Continual changes in focus Tend to create 'make work projects' Limited career growth, unstructured support -Too many complacent former lawyers -Lack of employee onboarding -Remote work leads to lack of camaraderie Company has changed. Loyalty seems to be gone. Lots of turnover. It can take a while to get things done, it's an international business and there are opportunities for in-country teams to better support each other to achieve overall business revenue that could further accelerate growth and increase customer spend. If I could give 0 stars I would. This company is EXTREMELY toxic and management is only out to make themselves look good in the lime light of leadership. They will pull the rug out from underneath of you and make you look bad so they look good. DO NOT WORK HERE"
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Change-Healthcare-Reviews-E901352.htm,"It is very well organized Over the years the organization continues to improve its focus on things that matter. Lots of opportunity with the integration into Optum. You have an ability to grow your career here, but depending on your manager you will need to focus on advocating for what you want/need to grow your skillset and gain exposure to new opportunities. Work from home Benefits after 60 or 90 days (I don’t remember) Depending on supervisor will work with you having emergencies. You get 2 15min paid breaks a day & 30 min lunch. NO pros for bilingual reps, you will NOT be allowed to move out of the call center. Flexible/variable schedules/hours, telecommute, supportive fellow PAR's, my direct supervisor was extremely supportive but from communicating with others with other supervisors this is a hit or miss. -Great amount of PTO/Automatically approved -Medical scheduling/EMR experience Work from home was nice. The team members were the only reason for staying at the job Good co-workers. Very smart people. None. I would never work for this company again. It was acquired by Optum Insight in Oct 2022 - so I would not work for them either","Nothing much to say actually It's a large corporation which means lots of administration, things move slowly and are more expensive than they should be. Still pockets of shared services that are focused on their explicit responsibilities instead of the common goal, they don't fully understand the businesses they support and don't take the time to learn it. Need to continue cultural shift toward working as one team with the businesses to deliver outstanding products and services to market. None of them are on the same page. They all expect different things from you but aren’t great at communicating that. They have a QA team that listens to your calls & scores you on them. However, they never want to show you what you missed only tell you to fix things. They tell you to follow script on calls but then you get counted off for not saying things that aren’t In your script. It is extremely difficult to get a raise there because of the things they count off for. Very micro managed, you get counted off for being off the phone to long, even being away from the phone in the bathroom. They only want it to add up to 10 min for the whole day. The rules, expectations, and script change all the time and they just sent out a message or email about it but no training and you have to hope you remember. Also phones ring none stop a lot of days and patients can be extremely rude depending upon department and state you work for. If you are hired as a bilingual rep, you better sit tight and search for another line of work someplace else, because Change will NOT let you move out of the call center. They will claim you are ""too valuable"" for the team, as an excuse to keep you there, and trust me they will promote people who should have been fired long ago before they promote you, AND THEY EXPECT YOU TO DO IT FOR CRAP PAY. They change their processes and procedures way, way too often. No consistency. Management is completely unavailable. Computer systems fail almost daily leaving you unable to assist patients with anything. No benefits unless you work 32 hours per week and those are only PTO and unmatched 401k. Your call evaluations do not take your level of customer service into account, it's all only if you repeat their script verbatim, and I do mean *verbatim* Supervisors, leads, and managers can be rude, sarcastic and dismissive when needing help or asking questions to do the job. The temple hospital client is extremely disorganized. Dealing with rude patients constantly was mentally taxing, it's a good position for something temporary or part-time not long-term. The goals they set for their employees was pretty ridiculous. Each call to retrieve charts can take approximately 5-10 minutes as you are put on hold and waiting for the location to retrieve the chart. Then, you are to fill out a report about each call after the call is completed-they frown on filling out report during call. However, there was an expected goal of each employee to complete 7-10 calls an hour, which is pretty much impossible. Management is then constantly reminding the workers through an online chat that we were not meeting expectations. It was an extremely high stress environment. -Terrible management, not fit to manage people and both VP and Director should not be in those roles. -My entire team was let go on a teams call, VP of my department read from a script. Very insincere. -Health Insurance for one person was over $2,000 a year before out of pocket deductibles. CHC doesn't participate in cost sharing with their employees. -Optum acquired CHC and has been laying people off for months and is very secretive about it and threatens your severance if you say anything. Bad top management. Consistently cut off their noses despite their faces. Can't see the forest through the trees. Looks a gift horse in the mouth. Quarterly results comes first, nothing else comes second. Sold out the wealth creators (labor) for maximum payoff in an acquisition. Executive team is not committed to rewarding its sales team fairly and does not care about employees. I had a very large government deal that was over 99% closed. When Change Healthcare was acquired by Optum Insight, they sold off the business unit that I was part of. Then they would not pay me the $250K commission on the government deal that I had worked on for over a year. There was virtually nothing left for them to do other than to wait for state approvals which took a couple of months. Since I was now with the business unit that had been sold off, they would not pay me for the significant/strategic win that I was responsible for."

Leadership prioritizes government satisfaction over everything, at the detriment of their employees. They'll take the ""customer's"" side 100% of the time and throw the employee under the bus. Keeping up appearances and cozy relationships mean more to KBR than supporting their actual employees, addressing inefficiencies, or having the integrity and courage to tell entrenched federal civil servants something they don't want to hear. KNR has poor business ethics, wasteful and bloated in middle and upper management. They put on a good show, but the truth is they'll do just about anything to keep the federal pork rolling in. Hiring practices are best described as ""catch and release."" I was told several outright lies by a hiring manager and HR that convinced me to leave a secure job, and was laid off months later at their financial whim (a situation they also told me several lies regarding). They don't care and don't see front line employees as humans deserving of security and support -- just disposable things to be used then thrown out. It's a great gravy train if you're an overpaid, director-level professional schmoozer. If you're an average worker at KBR, keep your resume fresh and don't ignore recruiter calls. You may need them sooner than you think. Not too many projects to keep all engineers working need more paid sick time No real cons yet and I have been here for 4 years. Expect you to normally work overtime…instead of just now and then having too. No bonuses Lazy overhead Untruthful job requirements The signs were there at the start of working for KBR NSS and luckily I left quickly. The interview was easy and the offer was made within 24hrs which should have been a red flag. I soon realized after starting the job why the offer was made so quickly. Equipment sent me had issues (remote position), HR not getting my benefits setup correctly even though I submitted all necessary documents on time, meet/greet meetings with upper management being pushed out multiple times over months, the project control lead was passive aggressive, no work/life balance because constant meetings and emails from managers late at night. They will not tell you in interview there will be mandatory workdays per week at MST time zone since contract is in Colorado. The contract team was very unprofessional and immature. Benefits have been reduced in the 2 years i have been here. lost quite a lot of the 401k match and HSA match none that I can think of. Very few locations available under KBR.No cons at the moment.

There is no words to honestly say about the way i felt being called on the ohone to be let go on my day off. Benefits, pay, work atmosphere, quality of food It was good job experience Good pay, short shifts, chill sidework Employees at pf chang have a contagious personality bound to keep you smiling !!! Good money and fun environment Customer service skills learned there.","Not enough hours sometimes for employee Summers are slow No Benefits unless full-time I think this place could be such an amazing place to work if they actually held standards for its members of staff. You have certain management in place that ultimately don’t care about the brand itself but more so the money they make. It’s not about the care for the company but really coming to work to make a paycheck and that’s where they drop the ball. I hope that this is something they fix or they will continually lose out on awesome people. I believe in the brand and always will but upper management need to change and see the bigger picture not just themselves. I left a great job to come here and i have a 10 month old Daughter. I was told this was a family careing environment. 4 weeks into training i was cut for doing a great job. I am incredibly ashamed of this company . I hVe no words to describe my thoughts and feelings about it. Shame on you at the top. I honestly will never recommend your restaurant to anyone. Its really all about numbers not people . You have lost your morals and decency. The long hours and weekend shifts. Could be more incentive for promotion Business depends heavily on the mall. If no one wants to go to the mall that day, there is usually a reflection in the restaurant. Need long gloves to keep water out off your gloves and water/ soap off your hands Tipping out was horrible. Highest I have ever seen I have no cons to share."
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Primark-Reviews-E36867.htm,"I loved everyone I worked with, a great environment As full time there are some decent benefits available Everything runs like a well-oiled machine Some of the pros at primark was their teamwork, If you needed help or had a question there were plenty of people to ask who had the answer. - One of the pros of working at primark is that it offers good pay to employers people are really nice and welcoming. Great team work with good management Welcoming the customers, good marketing, great nice items that were purchasable, and great team work between coworkers & managers. The employees are friendly and are willing to help when you are unsure of something. My best advice to always ask questions so they can help you understand to do a certain task. They have competitive pay I believe $15 an hour. The offer 401k, PTO, Sick time. There are nice supervisors and they’re flexible with your lifestyle","No cons I can think of! Though the floor managers are amazing the higher ups were horrible. I the store manager and assistant store manager were the worst. But the department managers and floor supervisors did make up for it There is none that I can think of Some cons at primark was that it was sometimes stressful when it was only two cashiers while the store was busy but once you got the hang of it it started getting easier - Can get overwhelming and stressful at times it can get boring at times Tiring long hours of working Organizing on the floor, it did get pretty messy but we had lots of customers, so I understand. Management complicated things too much. Unfortunate customers, require a lot of patience"
