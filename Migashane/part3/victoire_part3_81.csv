The company brings workers from other countries to come work, and because they have contracts, they get all the hours over the American staff. When it gets slow, the American staff pretty much gets the bare minimum hours and has to outsource to other locations on the property to get hours even though we are supposed to be full-time. Equipment breaks down, instead of just getting a new one they continue to spend thousands of dollars to keep fixing the same issue over and over. Also, computer systems drop in the middle of service. Some of the members can be really rude when you are following the rules, and expect to be treated all differently and better than others. It just keeps getting slower and worse as the years progress. Work some weekends and holidays. Not really able to work from home at this property. Potential to earn work from home days but not enough laptops (has to be a company laptop) and not very many opportunities. You sit on a computer all day. Typically share an office. The PTO policy could be better. Where to start? The senior management are the worse. You can tell that they're only trying to protect their bonuses by the decisions they make. A lot of the employees use inappropriate language, racist terms against their coworkers, have sexually charged conversations and are never disciplined for it. There's a lot of favoritism. Managers are either poorly trained or just naturally ignorant. The pay is terrible for the job. You can make better money at other hotels in the areas. There's no appreciation for workers who actually do a good job. Everything is broken. Nothing works correctly, and it's hard to take pride in working at a property that is falling apart. This is truly a horrible place to work. The work became redundant after a while No cons about Omni specifically, but as with other hospitality jobs 24/7 availability can be difficult for some - but those with a passion to serve the guest always find their way! Inconsistent scheduling is to be expected with new team of management Off-site IT can slow down finding solutions to technical issues.

This is truly a horrible place to work. Front of house supervising roles do not pay enough for adults with responsibilities. The new culture of the hotel is not ideal. There is little to no work life balance. The employee turnover rate feels like it is at an all time high right now. Lack of leaders right now makes it hard for many people FOH/BOH. The hotel is cheap so they deal with issues that they shouldn’t be. Air conditioning is always inconsistent, and things are broken and take forever to get fixed. Work some weekends and holidays.

You sit on a computer all day. Typically share an office. The PTO policy could be better. Inconsistent scheduling is to be expected with new team of management I think the work life balance in the hospitality industry is unheard of in middle management altogether, but it is unreasonable to expect 50-60 hour work weeks without additional compensation. Although upper management has a more consistent schedule, they are putting in the same amount of hours as well.

Equipment breaks down, instead of just getting a new one they continue to spend thousands of dollars to keep fixing the same issue over and over. Also, computer systems drop in the middle of service. Some of the members can be really rude when you are following the rules, and expect to be treated all differently and better than others. It just keeps getting slower and worse as the years progress. Where to start? The senior management are the worse. You can tell that they're only trying to protect their bonuses by the decisions they make. A lot of the employees use inappropriate language, racist terms against their coworkers, have sexually charged conversations and are never disciplined for it. There's a lot of favoritism. Managers are either poorly trained or just naturally ignorant. The pay is terrible for the job. You can make better money at other hotels in the areas. There's no appreciation for workers who actually do a good job. Everything is broken. Nothing works correctly, and it's hard to take pride in working at a property that is falling apart. This is truly a horrible place to work. Front of house supervising roles do not pay enough for adults with responsibilities. The new culture of the hotel is not ideal. There is little to no work life balance. The employee turnover rate feels like it is at an all time high right now. Lack of leaders right now makes it hard for many people FOH/BOH. The hotel is cheap so they deal with issues that they shouldn’t be. Air conditioning is always inconsistent, and things are broken and take forever to get fixed. Work some weekends and holidays. Not really able to work from home at this property. Potential to earn work from home days but not enough laptops (has to be a company laptop) and not very many opportunities. You sit on a computer all day. Typically share an office. The PTO policy could be better. Inconsistent scheduling is to be expected with new team of management I think the work life balance in the hospitality industry is unheard of in middle management altogether, but it is unreasonable to expect 50-60 hour work weeks without additional compensation. Although upper management has a more consistent schedule, they are putting in the same amount of hours as well. The work became redundant after a while No cons about Omni specifically, but as with other hospitality jobs 24/7 availability can be difficult for some - but those with a passion to serve the guest always find their way!"

Too many things to learn as a fresher Flexible, Opportunities for Growth, and overall great company culture","Large matrixed organization, easy to get lost This company and the out-of-touch CEO in particular put so much burden on you as an employee: Demand that you return to office (regardless of your input) without supplying the right resources to ensure an efficient and accomodating environment. Not enough seats, working external monitors, or conference rooms. No personal desks - still hot desks. No ergonomic chairs and only a limited number of standing desks. Demand you complete hours of compliancy training on topics from harassment to disability accomodations but discriminate against employees with chronic illnesses, requiring you to put an end-date for remote work agreements on your accomodation forms - even if if your chronic illness has no end. Will throw out your request if you leave end-date as undefined even with a doctor's note. And they also require you to provide the note as quickly as possible and will throw out your request if not even if you can't get in to see a doctor in time. Demand you be a part of culture activities as a reason to be back in the office even if it takes up valuable client time (will hold back promotions if you don't show face - this is the CEO's primary reason for forced RTO), all while encouraging you to take on extra UNPAID DUTIES like using your educational stipend. How are we supposed to spend more time in the office on top of additional education? Then, of course, if you do use your stipend, you're trapped working there for at least a year in a hostile working environment because you'll be forced to pay it back if you leave early. There is a ""it's never enough"" mentality at the C-suite. Only care about issues when it directly impacts them (i.e. now its all about cancer because of the unfortunate health situation with CEO - there are several other people in the group with other serious ailments who suffer in silence) Talent is of little importance although publicly the groupe does great PR to showcase the opposite. For example, Publicis launched the ""work your world program"" with great PR since it allows you to work from any Publicis office for 6 weeks. Great idea, yet they failed to mention that the employee is responsible for all cost including room and board. Obviously this is a program for the most privileged employees - not for those who work for their paychecks. This program had the best intentions in mind but was not build with minority employees in mind. RTO 3x a week is being forced Underpaid, doing multiple jobs within recruitment space i.e. social media management, content creation, event planning, leading hiring strategies on multiple levels High pressure, working with high level executives It doesn't feel that management truly cares about employees. We recently had a change of work policy where we're expected to come in 3 days a week. Meanwhile, the company is posting on LinkedIn for Mental Health Awareness Month about the power of going for a walk...it feels very disingenuous. There was also no reasoning from management about why we're returning to office. It was basically a ""just do it because we have to"" mentality. This will also play a part in determining whether you're eligible for a merit raise (which is typically below cost of living amount) even if performance is great and the company is able to provide them.

Great idea, yet they failed to mention that the employee is responsible for all cost including room and board. Obviously this is a program for the most privileged employees - not for those who work for their paychecks. This program had the best intentions in mind but was not build with minority employees in mind. RTO 3x a week is being forced Underpaid, doing multiple jobs within recruitment space i.e. social media management, content creation, event planning, leading hiring strategies on multiple levels High pressure, working with high level executives It doesn't feel that management truly cares about employees. We recently had a change of work policy where we're expected to come in 3 days a week. Meanwhile, the company is posting on LinkedIn for Mental Health Awareness Month about the power of going for a walk...it feels very disingenuous. There was also no reasoning from management about why we're returning to office. It was basically a ""just do it because we have to"" mentality. This will also play a part in determining whether you're eligible for a merit raise (which is typically below cost of living amount) even if performance is great and the company is able to provide them. If you want to feel like just a number in an equation, I'd suggest coming to work here. Fair amount of overhead and waste UNDERPAID overworked no benefits no bonus Should be more understanding of employment Discrepancies in wages Lack of communicationLarge matrixed organization, easy to get lost RTO 3x a week is being forced This company and the out-of-touch CEO in particular put so much burden on you as an employee: Demand that you return to office (regardless of your input) without supplying the right resources to ensure an efficient and accomodating environment. Not enough seats, working external monitors, or conference rooms. No personal desks - still hot desks. No ergonomic chairs and only a limited number of standing desks. Demand you complete hours of compliancy training on topics from harassment to disability accomodations but discriminate against employees with chronic illnesses, requiring you to put an end-date for remote work agreements on your accomodation forms - even if if your chronic illness has no end. Will throw out your request if you leave end-date as undefined even with a doctor's note. And they also require you to provide the note as quickly as possible and will throw out your request if not even if you can't get in to see a doctor in time. Demand you be a part of culture activities as a reason to be back in the office even if it takes up valuable client time (will hold back promotions if you don't show face - this is the CEO's primary reason for forced RTO), all while encouraging you to take on extra UNPAID DUTIES like using your educational stipend. How are we supposed to spend more time in the office on top of additional education? Then, of course, if you do use your stipend, you're trapped working there for at least a year in a hostile working environment because you'll be forced to pay it back if you leave early. Fair amount of overhead and waste There is a ""it's never enough"" mentality at the C-suite. Only care about issues when it directly impacts them (i.e. now its all about cancer because of the unfortunate health situation with CEO - there are several other people in the group with other serious ailments who suffer in silence) Talent is of little importance although publicly the groupe does great PR to showcase the opposite.

Although not perfect and we have our disagreements we always get the job done have fun doing it. - Stability - Competitive Salary - Career Options When I was in a different district, the staff and management was incredibly understanding and positive about future opportunities. Everyone knew what to do, and management made sure everyone was properly trained and supported in their role. Great team and fun work events Everyone is wonderful to work with and they provide opportunities to level up with educational resources. I have been through many changes with the company and overall I think they value employees. Paid training, and the training also paid for you to move.","Pay is ok but could be better. - management & customer service teams are not very organized, which puts more work on the sales side. keep in mind, as the salesperson you are in the top role & you will have the most workload other than a manager. - work/life balance is not really promoted within this area. always the go, go, go approach - no longer paying for overtime, so working saturdays/trying to get your work done during the day is impossible. there will always be work to be done, do not expect a 9-5 sales role. - if you do not go through the training program, they do not train you. it is a ""sink or swim"" mentality, you learn as you go. - for several, it is not easy to move internally & will take a while for them to let you get promoted or move to a different team - I showed up don ay one and they didn't have a plan for me for training - my office had toxic negativity. a lot of people clearly hate their jobs - managers don't know how to resolve conflict in the office and let people walk all over them -the software system they use is a dinosaur, so insanely old and difficult to learn. very tedious and time consuming to do most tasks -the training is 2-3+ months for a customer service position - the communication within the company is awful - no one ever knows what is going on - there is an obvious lack of drive and ambition within the team and managers. managers do not set a good example - talk during meetings and don't take notes/ ask questions I would not recommend this position or company to anyone unless it is your only option I used to work from home. Management decided it was best that we go back to the office. My closest office is now 40 min away from me. they will not give a raise to me for having to drive, and they wont give me a stipend either. Navigating large companies can feel like a complex maze, whether you're starting out or have years of experience. If you find yourself in an unfavorable role or a toxic team, create and use your network, HR, and resources to address it. Document your experiences and focus on finding a better fit—opportunities are all around you, don't just sit in it. Feeling stuck is temporary; know that support is available. While technology and better processes has been a work in progress over the years, their journey to a multibillion-dollar enterprise on the existing system is still impressive and I have no doubt evolving with new tech will speed up as it has been. Noting that it is a point of frustration for tech savvy associates and our up-and-coming generations, so it needs to continue to be a main focus. Our ordering system is still on ""Green Screen"" No commission for the Inside Sales Support people. - Some Short-Staffing - Some Management Misunderstandings - Location-Specific Issues (Not as much support for roles and locations in certain districts) More of an account management role. Not much room for new business growth. Being a reliable employee isn't always rewarded as it should be. If they keep pushing more work on individuals without raises or even true remote pay band locations, they will lose individuals with lots of knowledge that will cost them dearly to replace. Rude, demeaning managers and colleagues. Not much upward climb…what I viewed as “good” pay was no where near industry standards. A kind of job you’d be stuck with for life, and the kind of job average people do work for life. They treat all employees as numbers and expect you to do whatever they say including move across the country in the snap of a finger. They also want you to get used to being at work by 6am, this place is a joke! Can’t believe I started here with a 4 year college degree. I hope someone looks at this and chooses another path that does not waste their time like this place did. By the way I trained in Seattle and with an old man who retired as our training class graduated. I can’t remember his name but he was such an A Hole. It’s hilarious to me now that I’m incredibly successful actually using my marketing degree. What a shameful company I barely even hit the tip of the iceberg with this review.

While technology and better processes has been a work in progress over the years, their journey to a multibillion-dollar enterprise on the existing system is still impressive and I have no doubt evolving with new tech will speed up as it has been. Noting that it is a point of frustration for tech savvy associates and our up-and-coming generations, so it needs to continue to be a main focus. Our ordering system is still on ""Green Screen"" No commission for the Inside Sales Support people. Recently they've become dollar over value and not putting the employees 1st. Customers are now viewed as dollar signs rather than partnerships and are treated like numbers. You will be over worked and under paid. Baptism by fire. This use to be a great company but management is out of touch. Everything else lol No support from management Strict policy Turning into a call center. Unreliable help.Pay is ok but could be better. - management & customer service teams are not very organized, which puts more work on the sales side. keep in mind, as the salesperson you are in the top role & you will have the most workload other than a manager. - work/life balance is not really promoted within this area. always the go, go, go approach - no longer paying for overtime, so working saturdays/trying to get your work done during the day is impossible. there will always be work to be done, do not expect a 9-5 sales role. - if you do not go through the training program, they do not train you. it is a ""sink or swim"" mentality, you learn as you go. - for several, it is not easy to move internally & will take a while for them to let you get promoted or move to a different team - I showed up don ay one and they didn't have a plan for me for training - my office had toxic negativity. a lot of people clearly hate their jobs - managers don't know how to resolve conflict in the office and let people walk all over them -the software system they use is a dinosaur, so insanely old and difficult to learn. very tedious and time consuming to do most tasks -the training is 2-3+ months for a customer service position - the communication within the company is awful - no one ever knows what is going on - there is an obvious lack of drive and ambition within the team and managers. managers do not set a good example - talk during meetings and don't take notes/ ask questions I would not recommend this position or company to anyone unless it is your only option I used to work from home. Management decided it was best that we go back to the office. My closest office is now 40 min away from me. they will not give a raise to me for having to drive, and they wont give me a stipend either. Navigating large companies can feel like a complex maze, whether you're starting out or have years of experience. If you find yourself in an unfavorable role or a toxic team, create and use your network, HR, and resources to address it. Document your experiences and focus on finding a better fit—opportunities are all around you, don't just sit in it. Feeling stuck is temporary; know that support is available.

Our ordering system is still on ""Green Screen"" No commission for the Inside Sales Support people. - Some Short-Staffing - Some Management Misunderstandings - Location-Specific Issues (Not as much support for roles and locations in certain districts) More of an account management role. Not much room for new business growth. Being a reliable employee isn't always rewarded as it should be. If they keep pushing more work on individuals without raises or even true remote pay band locations, they will lose individuals with lots of knowledge that will cost them dearly to replace. Rude, demeaning managers and colleagues. Not much upward climb…what I viewed as “good” pay was no where near industry standards. A kind of job you’d be stuck with for life, and the kind of job average people do work for life. They treat all employees as numbers and expect you to do whatever they say including move across the country in the snap of a finger. They also want you to get used to being at work by 6am, this place is a joke! Can’t believe I started here with a 4 year college degree. I hope someone looks at this and chooses another path that does not waste their time like this place did. By the way I trained in Seattle and with an old man who retired as our training class graduated. I can’t remember his name but he was such an A Hole. It’s hilarious to me now that I’m incredibly successful actually using my marketing degree. What a shameful company I barely even hit the tip of the iceberg with this review. So much more to say."

Pay slightly low than comparable jobs in other companies- Base pay for the area could be slightly higher, but the bonus program is great especially for a non-sales role - No free snacks or food. - There is an alarm on the stairwell door on the first floor so you couldn't take the stairs even if you wanted to. - Raises don't keep up with inflation. Morningstar hasn't come out of the pandemic stronger-- it got worse. The CEO is obsessed with stopping remote work and wants to control all the adults he hired. A new development that was a sign it was time to leave -- the company tracks your location by IP address, counting how many days you're in the office and sends your manager a report so that you can be checked up on, praised or scolded. Kinda like KinderCare, right? If you fall below 3 days a week, in-person: your bonus is cut, your raises are off the table, no equity. In an already wage stagnant company, how will you ever get paid fairly? Another drawback, women are so undervalued here, not moving up so they are moving out. Execs and longtime employees in engineering, sales, data events, head of investor relations, marketing, product, customer -- after years of trying they left and are all leading from new c-level roles. Even worse, they have been doing quiet layoffs and ushered out some great execs including the head of employee experience who challenged the status quo. These people argued against Kunal's post-pandemic ideas and then had to welcome the new, anti-employee CHRO. What a poor culture fit. The veterans will agree that very little of Joe's or Don's intellectual, inclusive, people-first founders culture remains and what is left is a negative, punitive place to work. No downsides to report for employer - Pay is meh - Working customer service for the first few months kinda sucks Long hours, and inflexible work schdule. What used to be great about this company is being lost. The competing cultures of the companies that joined through acquisitions are eroding the great culture, and the new CHRO is determined to make sure it goes away forever. It's a shame because this was a truly great company. No much to say about cons The priorities are consistently changing, so you will work on something and then have to forget it the next day. Pay slightly low than comparable jobs in other companies"

The only perk for having great sales is not getting fired! THEY WILL FIRE YOU if you do not meet many sales goals you earn nothing for. 2) Harassment! Due to the competitive sales, with the risk of losing your job, this means your co-workers hate you, and bring toxic hostility if you get a sale, or will lie and input their information for your sale. It is a toxic environment and this is a teen shoe store nothing fancy. 3)Harassment Part 2! The customers DO NOT want to be followed around every inch of the store, they do not want employees down their necks or staring at them constantly. However, Journeys tells you to hover over them and keep asking questions even if they want to be left alone. When a customer wants space, you give them space. I saw many employees continuously approach after a customer rejection because these employees want to keep their jobs and management is watching your every move. Customers are not happy, and employees are stressed out. 4) Pay is $15 no negotiation, no increase. Was condescended to and belittled by senior management team. Unless it's peak season pay will not be enough to support family Was explicitly told that people were not allowed to be sick on Saturdays. If I could describe upper management in one word it would be: micromanagers Very strict with daily sales goals, could sometimes be written up for not selling enough Very strict about pitching everything to build the sales, so sometimes it was stressful The ladders we had to use were so insanely dangerous. There wasn't enough room in between the aisles to prop the ladder at a safe angle, so it would wobble and feel like it would tip over with the slightest move. I told my manager and she laughed and said something like 'yeah its dangerous, I'm pregnant and have fallen before' and the other employees just laughed about it. The pay was ridiculously low, and the 'training' was essentially just the other employees having me run to the back to grab shoes they needed. Nothing in the back was alphabetized or organized in any coherent manner and yet they expected me to memorize where all the brands were my first day on the job. Horrible experience! 10/10 would NOT recommend. Their sales approach. They should not push three pairs of shoes when a customer only wants one Not competitive pay for the area and no room for raises The constant push by upper management to meet quotas of selling multiples, and accessories. Trying to meet these quotas while maybe not the most difficult does prove annoying to both the worker and the customer. lots of backroom stock work - low pay for managementThere aren’t any cons in my opinion 1) Competitive sales, with no commission or extra pay for more sales.

Horrible experience! 10/10 would NOT recommend. Their sales approach. They should not push three pairs of shoes when a customer only wants one Not competitive pay for the area and no room for raises The constant push by upper management to meet quotas of selling multiples, and accessories. Trying to meet these quotas while maybe not the most difficult does prove annoying to both the worker and the customer. lots of backroom stock work - low pay for managementThere aren’t any cons in my opinion 1) Competitive sales, with no commission or extra pay for more sales. The only perk for having great sales is not getting fired! THEY WILL FIRE YOU if you do not meet many sales goals you earn nothing for. 2) Harassment! Due to the competitive sales, with the risk of losing your job, this means your co-workers hate you, and bring toxic hostility if you get a sale, or will lie and input their information for your sale. It is a toxic environment and this is a teen shoe store nothing fancy. 3)Harassment Part 2! The customers DO NOT want to be followed around every inch of the store, they do not want employees down their necks or staring at them constantly. However, Journeys tells you to hover over them and keep asking questions even if they want to be left alone. When a customer wants space, you give them space. I saw many employees continuously approach after a customer rejection because these employees want to keep their jobs and management is watching your every move. Customers are not happy, and employees are stressed out. 4) Pay is $15 no negotiation, no increase. Was condescended to and belittled by senior management team. Unless it's peak season pay will not be enough to support family Was explicitly told that people were not allowed to be sick on Saturdays. If I could describe upper management in one word it would be: micromanagers The ladders we had to use were so insanely dangerous. There wasn't enough room in between the aisles to prop the ladder at a safe angle, so it would wobble and feel like it would tip over with the slightest move. I told my manager and she laughed and said something like 'yeah its dangerous, I'm pregnant and have fallen before' and the other employees just laughed about it.

Horrible experience! 10/10 would NOT recommend. - Sales goal is sometimes difficult to reach - SOPs are even harder to reach - computer system can be confusing to work - scheduled shifts are rare after holidays and busier times - managers don’t care about your well being and see you as just a money maker - the people that work there are very selective and talk trash about each other - a lot of trash talking goes on with managers and employees - during closing, you’re pretty much responsible for everything. Including fixing shoes, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, gathering trash, and dusting (sometimes). While one employee does all this, managers count money and then have you check amount in registers and sign. - training also isn’t fun and is pretty much non existent since working hours aren’t consistent enough to actually apply training to the job - being on stock isn’t much better, in our store we have shelves that are 10 ft tall and we have to go up and down ladders with boxes that fall out all the time. I’ve seen piles out boxes fall out on someone’s head because of a broken shelf and the managers didn’t do anything about it. There is also falling off the ladders which happens more than you think. - Also had to miss my High school prom because my manager scolded me for giving away too many shifts minimum wage, sometimes disorganized you know - Lied about base pay - No upper management support - Drama filled - Dont ask management a question because they don't know the answer or the answer will change 5 times - Unrealistic goals Very strict with daily sales goals, could sometimes be written up for not selling enough Very strict about pitching everything to build the sales, so sometimes it was stressful • can’t wear nike • only $11/hr when most places offer $14-16 for shift leaders • very minimal hours because you’re competing with 16 year olds who can only work after school Pay is not guaranteed, horrible Managment, disrespectful co workers, fraudulent company, your suppose to get commission and you barely get what your told your going to get.

Since I've been here we've been looking for ways to get digital versions of various forms and it really shouldn't take 5+ years to find and implement a solution to basic things like that. Related to that, the company's approach to work from home and general work/life balance is similarly old-fashioned. The slow rollback to what we were doing before the pandemic is nearly complete, and its been pretty disappointing that those scant few ways life improved during the pandemic have been tossed aside for no discernable reason.

Been here for 5+ years and in recent years I've realized that if you have a good manager you will be doing amazing science and happy.

As the company grows, budget restrictions also continue to grow. Most people are overworked. Headcount tends to be favored toward certain teams, while others seem to receive new headcount every week.
