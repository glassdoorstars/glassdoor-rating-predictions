It is a good company and cannot think of one right now Basic salary increase 3% hike per year. No bonus increase for the last 5 years of working in this company. The Talent Acquisition department don't have enough work for all the recruiters so they will keep having layoffs. They already laid off a lot of people in the departmnt. unhealthy pipeline leads to layoffs Were to start. Experienced enough negative in 5 yrs that would cover 25 years of work. Back stabbing, steady stream of of tire tracks on people’s backs. Do not buy the ‘Best Place to Work’ bs. They force you to complete the survey. Very toxic work environment. Sr Staff were very rude to others on the team and they were the ones that got promoted. The job I was hired to do I was never allowed to do and was assigned lower level tasks. No severance when they decide to lay you off. Was not trained properly Never gave proper instruction, or a baseline of knowledge There are not a lot of young people, and not a company catered to new grads I was hired for two months as a new graduate and laid off without any warning and with no severance They were a little disorganized Working as a consultant has its downsidesNone at all, love, love, love this company!

Way too many meetings and not enough time to do actual job. If meetings can't be found within the 8-12 and 1-5 time frame, then they schedule over lunch which for most is more about breathing room adn catching up on email. A lot of shifting of teams causing churn. Lay-offs happen once to twice year and have so for well over 20 years. Most are not merit but for cost savings ie: senior experienced employees. Present ceo is only there to clean house and will to blame for more than expected people leaving above the over 1100 let go back in May. He and his newest c-level minion need to stop blaming the better c-level people who were let go. S Menke was a decent ceo, but KE is awful, only there for the kill. Sabre is suffering financially and it's not looking good. Debt load is increasing (just check out the SEC filings and quarterly shareholder reports) and mass layoffs aren't going to solve their significant problems. Executive leadership goes through a predictable and ineffective cycle of layoffs, reorganization, revised strategy, failure to deliver, and start it all over again with layoffs. Airlines are leaving en-masse, and they can't compete with Amadeus who are leaving Sabre in the dust. While there are some solid leaders there are many who are arrogant and think they walk on water while failing to deliver results. Sabre was once a great company to work for and many still feel that way, but unless they can pull out a miracle I feel they are heading for a huge fire sale. Changing budgets pivot projects. Not always clear on companies goals. Typically takes a quarter to figure out direction for upcoming year. Upper management who have zero clue make bad technical decisions Less room to get promoted because of bad management Things move way too slow. The super senior dinosaurs don't let the young crowd adapt new tech. Lot's of senior staff here do absolutely nothing meaningful or productive, but just play dirty politics and blame game. Not a good future. Too much politics. The first thing is the training staff is trash and after throwing me on a billion hotels I get put on a dedicated team with a supervisor who is so busy that she has no time for you. Then find out they laid off some of my team and the best supervisors they had. I would go for help to the other supervisor before my own. They boast we are still part of the company but from what they did and who they did it to it is not! under staffed and low pay high turnover covid impacts silo work environment Layoffs occur almost every year- Travel is a tough enviroment (post-COVID) - Current business model is not sustainable - Current executive leadership is not connecting with workers Hard to get approval on projects, many meetings are all out of a normal work day, Poland has no problem setting up a 4-6 hour meeting starting at 2AM CT, instead of compromising on both ends of work day.

Great people, great environment, great projects.","Large company and therefore some disconnect between staff and leadership This is not a good place for beginners. When I started at Stantec, it was my first job and while there was company onboarding, I was not trained for my job at all. The downside of working for such a big firm with lots of projects is that no one in management has time to train you. If you are comfortable with learning lots of new material on your own with zero guidance, then this is the place for you. Hard to get training - if your task doesn’t provide value to the company it won’t likely be approved. This is understandable but it keeps younger employees from developing faster. In turn this makes it harder to move up and get raises. There seems to be a surplus of layers of upper level management that have a lot of meetings with each other all the time. - Personally, my work is incredibly tedious and dull. There's no sense of growth or accomplishment, just mindless grinding. - Open office seating - High employee turnover. I think the slight majority of the people that I've met have been with the company for less than a year. There are still a lot of people in the office I have not met though. - Poor sense of community. There aren't really that many social events. - It's really difficult to get to know your coworkers... and I mention this as an extrovert. I'll go days without speaking to anyone in the office for more than a minute. It's like working among strangers. - Leadership feels like its absent - There isn't any job training when you start, you just kind of get thrown into your work after doing some orientation videos. Lower-end salary, high performance expectations, high demands for upkeep of training, standards and certification, diffusion of accountability, Since it is a large company, there is a sense of bureaucracy. Lots of paperwork and forms and training and everything is super formal. Sometimes there is a disconnect between project managers expectations and crews. The pay structure isn’t the best, and for how specialized the job is, the pay isn’t great. Raises and promotions come slow since it’s a large company. If you’re willing to stick around for awhile the raises and opportunities will come. The work can be infrequent and during the winter the hours are lacking and if there isn’t enough work people do get put on leave until springtime. The hours and days can be very long. Boring work, too “woke”, empty offices The size of the company plays a detrimental role in the overall organization of the projects, dissipating the workflow into a very messy dynamic. The leadership roles are affected by having way too much work, and doing mediocre project management at best for every project; consequently, the lower-ranked designers are hired in waves and laid-off unfairly months later. Needs work on professionalism from the leaders, and a sharp stop on favoritism that overshadows the real lack of talent. Poor access to industry seminars, too woke, lots of red tape Nothing I really like everything the company has to offerLarge company and therefore some disconnect between staff and leadership - Personally, my work is incredibly tedious and dull.

From HR to the supervisors makes it’s a JR high school. You have no type of real leadership. It’s very very very very messy and immature. If you look and dress a certain way , they’ll target you and make everything you do problematic. This warehouse is extremely toxic , extremely unhealthy. This place is very hostile for no reason!!!! Run. A lot of issues get swept under the rug. Run as far as you can from this place. More money means more work They didnt care about the employee. Period ..... they say they do and dont. Offered no support for people to do their job effectively in some roles and then blamed people for not being able to perform. Unrealistic sales goals designed to make sure you don't hit them. Only during Christmas or holiday season they'll make the sales goals easier but outside of that, they're banking on you not achieving your sales goals. Even if your store has 0 foot traffic, they gaslight you into thinking it's your fault there's no sales. This company will do anything and everything to make sure they don't pay you out. If the store's goals is 40,000 for a month and you sell 39,999, they won't think twice to say you didn't do enough. There are simply people who want something and people who don't. In the day of e-commerce it's becoming rarer for customers to come into a brick and mortar store other than to see in person what they've seen online. Managers make you think you can sell to EVERYONE when that simply isn't true. Customers walk in with their minds mostly made up, you can only nudge them in the right direction and maybe sometimes convince them to but a pair of they weren't looking for one in the first place. However, ITS CRIMINAL to NOT PAY OUT commission for every pair sold. So if your coworker happens to sell less than you and you have more hours, and naturally get more sales because of increased hours, then it brings down the store goal and screws everyone. If you don't collectively hit the goal, NO ONE gets paid. Horrible hours and high turnover. No upper level management support. management is always horrible on every level no opportunity for growth/advancement mandated overtime almost every week no one in management knows what they’re doing.

Ironically, when you interview outside, it is REALLY hard to hard to clean your name because outside of Nestle, everyone thinks that you are a slacker and you don't work if you are from Nestle.

Borderline insulting for certain positions. - If you are unable to attend unpaid work events that are after hours (even if you have 3 kids), you are made out to feel like you're not a part of the team. - Constant brown-nosing and kool-aid drinking is a MUST in order to stand any chance at getting promoted. Learn how to fake laugh at your managers and you will do well. - Highschool vibes. Very cliquey, and if you dont get in with the managers, you will stay in your current role- ""HAHAHAH I love hearing that joke about how you were on a yacht in fiji, and made that 10mil sale on mouses and keyboards. You're such a good manager."" The compensation offered by Ingram is below average, despite their claim of paying market value. They forget that remote jobs are a thing since Covid and they pay double or triple the base pay at Ingram. While they love to tout their company culture as a retention factor, the recent trend of high turnover with both people leaving and being let go is quite concerning. Ingram Micro will be going public in the summer/fall of 2023 and as a result, they are laying off employees in batches to streamline operations. Tenured employees are not safe at Ingram. They decided to not even host their annual sales kickoff event, which is pretty embarrassing on a global stage. Good luck getting a promotion due to favoritism which is rampant at Ingram Micro. Slows down, people are rude Something always going on there Very bad upper management, talk about losing up. Extremely high turnover, many people did not last the first few days. Company has as a soulless and careless culture. They too often have a ""lottery"" style lay off process. It doesn't matter how well you perform or contribute - due to extremely poor Executive Leadership - they simply randomly implement lay-offs just to make quarterly expected earnings - no loyalty to valuable employees Managers, Directors think all below peers are slaves HR controls everything including the GM, advancement only if you give into everything they say, people can call in and miss work up to 20 times a year without being let go so it’s always understaffed, no work life balance, be prepared to not be cared about no matter how hard you work…. For the size of the organization, they could use more structure in many aspects of the business. Coming from a sizeable, private organization, with processes being very black and white, Ingram has a lot of grey. Streamlining processes help in the training process, retention and make employees feel like they know what to expect, although I do appreciate the case by case, but everything doesn't need to be done that way.Difficult learning curve during onboarding - Ingram Micro is pompous, annoying, and overrated- they act like they are some tech-savvy giant, yet the office is something out of an 1970's office themed movie, and you are lucky if you can find a working monitor within your first month of working there. - Pay is below average to terrible in the industry.

It is a team environment and everyone helps each other. It's really a great concept. I enjoy working here and interacting with the Customers. They are really just a delight! I loved my coworkers they were super fun and really sweet. I also loved the job its self like wrapping flowers, making arrangements, and processing our load. Pro was only nice store to shop. 1 manager was decent that's it. Sneaky and fire you. I enjoyed the camaraderie and sense of purpose It's a busy store with a wide variety of product. You are given the training and knowledge to respond to customer inquiries regarding taste, what kind of product to buy for what event or meal they want to create, etc. You will learn how to work in EXTREMELY high pressure situations and juggle multiple tasks at once - this job takes multitasking to a new level. Meeting new people Hard work doesn’t go unnoticed Mostly friendly environment Opportunity to grow They were flexible and had a a pretty solid work environment. The people there were great and if I was going that way I'd work there again. Amazing coworkers!!! Love the energu The work itself is easy, time and a half pay on holidays plus time and a half pay on time worked over 8 hours in a day is nice","I hated that they make you push carts a lot One of the challenges of working here is really just the hours. I would like to work full time. The Union only guarantees a minimum of 12 hours per week. However, you usually get scheduled for more. The 81West bus (which takes you to the door)has limited availability on Sundays and stops running after 10PM on week days. I did not enjoy the hours and dry feeling the air gave my skin or stacking salt Lazy coworkers Working weekends and holidays The hiring process took a month but I'll chalk that up to Jewel, not Osco Sometimes late work hours at times The company sucks in all honesty. It cares so little about us its exhausting our floral department is run by max 3 people, THREE PEOPLE FOR AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT. Not to mention that all departments are competing with each other in regards to sales ours is always in the top 3.... We never got anything in return at all, not even more hours or raises or an increase in our payroll. Nothing for our hard work. Our store managers are not very great either when stressed he would take it out on others, and people would be happier when he wouldn't come into work. Before I left my coworker wasn't getting payed what she was supposed to start on and have not fixed it in the 5 months she has worked there. The work load is super stressful to the point where I'd break out in acne when i would work. It does not equate at all for what we get payed for. Not to mention that they are constantly raising prices since before the pandemic without raising wages, and actually they cut the annual raises from 50 cents a year to 25 cents a year very recently. Im probably forgetting stuff but this is already a lot. Military manager who doesn't allow you to be human. Came in on all my days early and did my job. Told on phone I didn't make probation with zero explanation. My God. These companies are so cruel now and you truly can't do your job without feeling stressed. A lot of management by drama, a very cliquey environment where favoritism wins. You are given all of the work but absolutely ZERO support by management. Rules that change seemingly daily and no communication that they have changed, and an extreme amount of pressure put on staff.
