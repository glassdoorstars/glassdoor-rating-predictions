The work-life balance was very poor. I was often expected to work 50+ hours per week, and I was rarely able to take time off. This made it difficult to have a personal life, and it took a toll on my physical and mental health. The pressure to bill hours was very high. I was constantly under pressure to bill as many hours as possible, even if it meant working on projects that I was not interested in or that were not aligned with my skills and interests. This made me feel like I was not being valued for my expertise, and it made it difficult to feel passionate about my work. The culture was very competitive. There was a lot of emphasis on winning at all costs. This made the work environment very stressful. In addition to the negative aspects of the job that I have already mentioned, I would also like to add that the consulting industry is very demanding. Consultants are often expected required to work on projects that are outside of their comfort zone. This can be a great challenge for some people, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming. Compensation is typically low compared to other companies. Certain clients are challenging to deal with and it can take time for Sogeti to find you a different client. But if you do good work, Sogeti has always done their best to help me find what I am looking for. Doing extra work outside work for clients can be overwhelming for many but is helpful during promotion time if you are capable of doing it. This is one of the worst companies I am aware to let you down even when you moved to the USA, purchased a house etc having to sell the house only one year later leaving the country, because Sogeti HR lives in La La land and only promotes certain people while getting rid of you and your decades of experience despite working over 10 hours every day, sometimes even at the weekend, hardly having a personal life. They terminate your contract after 3 years in order not to pay the 401K benefits and they use all kind of excuses - they do this over and over again with impunity, somebody should take them to court. They are affecting the lives of entire families and they simply do not care because they want to save a buck or two while upper management is paid exorbitant salaries thinking they are clever. Utter disgrace. A bunch of unprofessional, pretentious liars. Never make the mistake of trusting a job offer from them is free of problems. Experience wise you'd be better off working on a personal project than working here. They will put you on completely random projects where you will never be working towards any one technology or skillset. That is if you don't wind up benched for months, which is what happened to many others I spoke to. Essentially every person i was hired alongside left shortly after. Managers are glorified sales people who have no IT knowledge. A lot of politics and your actual performance will not matter as much as making a select few people like you (even if you only see them once every few months). Regardless of what skillset you interview for, this is a DevOps position. You will be doing AWS or Azure administration work. I was interviewed on a completely different skillset and working here mostly just left me with a useless chunk of my resume I mostly just talk around nowadays. Everyone I know who worked here had the same experience. Poor Management Poor Business Sense You are a contractor, in a sense, and sometimes you sit waiting for a client and then you get cut because a sales person loses a client. Did not place me in position I was originally hired for They hired me in 2020 through employee referral as a Manager Consultant. Then they put me into a developer position where I did my best and received many client appreciations from time to time, But Sogeti kept telling me that my pay rate is high, and I do not do anything for manager position, you did not put me on a manager position workwise, we are not allowed to work as lead when we are set as developer. They unofficially interviewed me again, assaulted me on phone call. Created whole bunch of negativities against me, They terminated me 9 days before my 3 years completion so that they could eat my 401k. So, when they talk through their 401k match, seriously they are faking. Please don't get lured by their benefits. They did the same thing with my other two friends. Not a lot of room for financial growth and your happiness with your role will be determined but the project you get placed on, sometimes it is good sometimes not so much. Overall good place to gain experience and network! I'm going to be 100% upfront with y'all I was terminated from this job but it was over a year ago and so I had time to chill and give a clear precise evaluation, Not much training but I'm pretty much used to that. They always had expectations that you would know things that you were never told about. When you made an error the lead would always put it in a group chat and let everybody know that you screwed up something and humiliate you in front of the whole team. And just the tone of the of the environment was just so uncomfortable. They told me I wasn't syncing with the team and that they would try to find me another role. Then , I got to see the uglier underbelly of the company at that point. The first PM I interviewed with was in panic mode because they only had a couple days to get their whole team assembled and they were freaking out. The second hiring PM I interviewed with was in the same boat. I didn’t have the skill needed for both those jobs. The 3rd person was even in a worse spot He needed to hire 2 devs for this project. The Devs interviewed with the client and the client loved them . The day they were supposed to start the project, the company Jack them for another project. That was more profitable. So the PM found two devs and the same thing happened. The Program manager was in tears. (and his a dude) . The job I interviewed for had a bill Rate 300% higher than my rate. They will Jack you on pay. Praise God I didn’t get the job. Before they fired me, they made me stay and train my replacement for a couple months. I think they wanted me to quit so they wouldn’t have to pay me UI benefits. Once he was trained, I was shown the door. They were somewhat professional but the tone my manager used with me was very harsh and condescending.Not really many I can share, honestly. It was a great experience.

Compensation is typically low compared to other companies. Certain clients are challenging to deal with and it can take time for Sogeti to find you a different client. But if you do good work, Sogeti has always done their best to help me find what I am looking for. Doing extra work outside work for clients can be overwhelming for many but is helpful during promotion time if you are capable of doing it. This is one of the worst companies I am aware to let you down even when you moved to the USA, purchased a house etc having to sell the house only one year later leaving the country, because Sogeti HR lives in La La land and only promotes certain people while getting rid of you and your decades of experience despite working over 10 hours every day, sometimes even at the weekend, hardly having a personal life. They terminate your contract after 3 years in order not to pay the 401K benefits and they use all kind of excuses - they do this over and over again with impunity, somebody should take them to court. They are affecting the lives of entire families and they simply do not care because they want to save a buck or two while upper management is paid exorbitant salaries thinking they are clever. Utter disgrace. A bunch of unprofessional, pretentious liars. Never make the mistake of trusting a job offer from them is free of problems. Experience wise you'd be better off working on a personal project than working here. They will put you on completely random projects where you will never be working towards any one technology or skillset. That is if you don't wind up benched for months, which is what happened to many others I spoke to. Essentially every person i was hired alongside left shortly after. Managers are glorified sales people who have no IT knowledge. A lot of politics and your actual performance will not matter as much as making a select few people like you (even if you only see them once every few months). Regardless of what skillset you interview for, this is a DevOps position. You will be doing AWS or Azure administration work. I was interviewed on a completely different skillset and working here mostly just left me with a useless chunk of my resume I mostly just talk around nowadays. Everyone I know who worked here had the same experience. Poor Management Poor Business Sense You are a contractor, in a sense, and sometimes you sit waiting for a client and then you get cut because a sales person loses a client. Not a lot of room for financial growth and your happiness with your role will be determined but the project you get placed on, sometimes it is good sometimes not so much. Overall good place to gain experience and network! Annual raises were nothing to write home about. Did not place me in position I was originally hired for They hired me in 2020 through employee referral as a Manager Consultant. Then they put me into a developer position where I did my best and received many client appreciations from time to time, But Sogeti kept telling me that my pay rate is high, and I do not do anything for manager position, you did not put me on a manager position workwise, we are not allowed to work as lead when we are set as developer. They unofficially interviewed me again, assaulted me on phone call. Created whole bunch of negativities against me, They terminated me 9 days before my 3 years completion so that they could eat my 401k. So, when they talk through their 401k match, seriously they are faking. Please don't get lured by their benefits. They did the same thing with my other two friends.Not really many I can share, honestly. It was a great experience. The work-life balance was very poor. I was often expected to work 50+ hours per week, and I was rarely able to take time off. This made it difficult to have a personal life, and it took a toll on my physical and mental health. The pressure to bill hours was very high. I was constantly under pressure to bill as many hours as possible, even if it meant working on projects that I was not interested in or that were not aligned with my skills and interests. This made me feel like I was not being valued for my expertise, and it made it difficult to feel passionate about my work. The culture was very competitive. There was a lot of emphasis on winning at all costs. This made the work environment very stressful.

Not a lot of room for financial growth and your happiness with your role will be determined but the project you get placed on, sometimes it is good sometimes not so much. Overall good place to gain experience and network! I'm going to be 100% upfront with y'all I was terminated from this job but it was over a year ago and so I had time to chill and give a clear precise evaluation, Not much training but I'm pretty much used to that. They always had expectations that you would know things that you were never told about. When you made an error the lead would always put it in a group chat and let everybody know that you screwed up something and humiliate you in front of the whole team. And just the tone of the of the environment was just so uncomfortable. They told me I wasn't syncing with the team and that they would try to find me another role. Then , I got to see the uglier underbelly of the company at that point. The first PM I interviewed with was in panic mode because they only had a couple days to get their whole team assembled and they were freaking out. The second hiring PM I interviewed with was in the same boat. I didn’t have the skill needed for both those jobs. The 3rd person was even in a worse spot He needed to hire 2 devs for this project. The Devs interviewed with the client and the client loved them . The day they were supposed to start the project, the company Jack them for another project. That was more profitable. So the PM found two devs and the same thing happened. The Program manager was in tears. (and his a dude) . The job I interviewed for had a bill Rate 300% higher than my rate. They will Jack you on pay. Praise God I didn’t get the job. Before they fired me, they made me stay and train my replacement for a couple months. I think they wanted me to quit so they wouldn’t have to pay me UI benefits. Once he was trained, I was shown the door. They were somewhat professional but the tone my manager used with me was very harsh and condescending.Not really many I can share, honestly. It was a great experience.

Everyone I know who worked here had the same experience. Poor Management Poor Business Sense You are a contractor, in a sense, and sometimes you sit waiting for a client and then you get cut because a sales person loses a client. Not a lot of room for financial growth and your happiness with your role will be determined but the project you get placed on, sometimes it is good sometimes not so much. Overall good place to gain experience and network! Annual raises were nothing to write home about. Did not place me in position I was originally hired for They hired me in 2020 through employee referral as a Manager Consultant. Then they put me into a developer position where I did my best and received many client appreciations from time to time, But Sogeti kept telling me that my pay rate is high, and I do not do anything for manager position, you did not put me on a manager position workwise, we are not allowed to work as lead when we are set as developer. They unofficially interviewed me again, assaulted me on phone call. Created whole bunch of negativities against me, They terminated me 9 days before my 3 years completion so that they could eat my 401k. So, when they talk through their 401k match, seriously they are faking. Please don't get lured by their benefits. They did the same thing with my other two friends.Not really many I can share, honestly. It was a great experience. The work-life balance was very poor. I was often expected to work 50+ hours per week, and I was rarely able to take time off. This made it difficult to have a personal life, and it took a toll on my physical and mental health. The pressure to bill hours was very high. I was constantly under pressure to bill as many hours as possible, even if it meant working on projects that I was not interested in or that were not aligned with my skills and interests. This made me feel like I was not being valued for my expertise, and it made it difficult to feel passionate about my work. The culture was very competitive. There was a lot of emphasis on winning at all costs. This made the work environment very stressful. In addition to the negative aspects of the job that I have already mentioned, I would also like to add that the consulting industry is very demanding. Consultants are often expected required to work on projects that are outside of their comfort zone. This can be a great challenge for some people, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming. Compensation is typically low compared to other companies. Certain clients are challenging to deal with and it can take time for Sogeti to find you a different client. But if you do good work, Sogeti has always done their best to help me find what I am looking for. Doing extra work outside work for clients can be overwhelming for many but is helpful during promotion time if you are capable of doing it. This is one of the worst companies I am aware to let you down even when you moved to the USA, purchased a house etc having to sell the house only one year later leaving the country, because Sogeti HR lives in La La land and only promotes certain people while getting rid of you and your decades of experience despite working over 10 hours every day, sometimes even at the weekend, hardly having a personal life. They terminate your contract after 3 years in order not to pay the 401K benefits and they use all kind of excuses - they do this over and over again with impunity, somebody should take them to court. They are affecting the lives of entire families and they simply do not care because they want to save a buck or two while upper management is paid exorbitant salaries thinking they are clever. Utter disgrace. A bunch of unprofessional, pretentious liars. Never make the mistake of trusting a job offer from them is free of problems. Experience wise you'd be better off working on a personal project than working here. They will put you on completely random projects where you will never be working towards any one technology or skillset. That is if you don't wind up benched for months, which is what happened to many others I spoke to. Essentially every person i was hired alongside left shortly after. Managers are glorified sales people who have no IT knowledge. A lot of politics and your actual performance will not matter as much as making a select few people like you (even if you only see them once every few months).

Teams seem to always be overworked and stretched too thin. I don't personally feel it, but I hear about it from other teams. Glassdoor has a very very progressive culture that is really focused on DEI. Sometimes it feels like it's a bit too much and it can be distracting or counter productive. As with any company, sales can be tough in terms of riding the rollercoaster of success. Sometimes lines are blurred with Indeed responsibilities and they can dominate the sales process. There is still concern about where Glassdoor will fit in for the long term in the jobs/branding strategy. Sometimes the vision for the future is a little blurry. We have expressed this to leadership, and they are already taking action on helping to provide clarity on this. Career opportunities for Success are a bit of a concern, and the pay isn't competitive.

Stable employment with a measured approach to product development","Slightly above average salary and benefits Their aren’t any cons to the program The product could sometimes be tough to sell. It took a while for them to keep up with current trends, so we weren't always selling what advisors wanted. TONS of cold calling. I also had a really negative experience with my team lead, but that wasn't typical. They take advantage of you and then disregard you when new upper management arrives after a few years, with their high salaries. The new leadership believes they have a better idea than the previous one, resulting in hardworking employees losing their jobs to outsourcing in India. However, the quality of work and service suffers because the cheaper labor is of lower quality. Additionally, the remaining employees have to shoulder a heavier workload because the ""more for less"" workers in India require constant supervision and cannot work independently. I joined Broadridge with clear intentions of transitioning from Operations to Product, drawing upon my 10+ years of deep industry experience. At the time, I had recently moved to the area and had two small children. I had been actively interviewing for product management roles but hadn't progressed past the final round in previous attempts. Feeling optimistic about proving myself, I accepted an Operations role at Broadridge, expecting it to be a stepping stone toward Product, even though the salary offered was only $40,000. My first interaction with the Chief Product Officer (CPO) was hopeful, as he seemed surprised that I was encountering challenges in moving into Product given my industry experience and background working with product teams in other firms. He encouraged me to apply for product roles and even for a position reporting directly to him. However, when I submitted my application, it was rejected without an interview, citing a high number of strong applicants. Following his advice, I tried applying for non-senior level product roles to gain entry into the department. Unfortunately, the CPO did not respond to my emails, leaving me frustrated and uncertain about my career prospects. To make matters worse, the CPO posted about internal mobility on our internal social media platform, Yammer, which our department was barred from using, further isolating me from potential opportunities. I tried reaching out to the Product Management leader for the products I used, and initially, she seemed open to my involvement in product requirements. However, when I eventually emailed the product team with a question, I faced immediate backlash from my boss' boss for contacting them, highlighting a disconnect between Operations and Product departments. Despite my efforts to secure a product management role, I found myself in a cycle of interviews for about 10-12 product positions. During one of these interviews, the hiring manager wanted to consider me for a Product Owner role, but I had to clarify that I hadn't previously worked in product management. This raised questions about the company's hiring process and their failure to acknowledge the information readily available on my resume. Throughout my time at Broadridge, my direct management seemed disengaged when I expressed my desire to move into product and not advance into Operations management. Additionally, the frequent turnover of first and second-level managers created a chaotic work environment, causing stress and affecting employee retention. To demonstrate my commitment to transitioning into product management, I took several blockchain courses and worked on a capstone use case project, collaborating with different teams to discuss potential opportunities. However, the lack of a streamlined process for turning ideas into action hindered any real progress. In the end, my experience at Broadridge was marked by frustration, financial setbacks, and a toll on my mental health. Despite my tenacity and problem-solving skills, the company's organizational barriers and lack of focus on true product work hampered my ability to pursue a fulfilling career path. Numerous conversations with PMs and leadership yielded little follow-through, and even efforts with the Human Resource Business Partner failed to result in any viable opportunities for career advancement. The company's overworked and stressed-out managers didn't inspire confidence in staying with the organization long-term. Compensation and room for growth Unsupportive upper management Not loyal to long term employees Constantly changing metrics Client Relations takes the brunt of all tasks and issues Continuous improvements and many layoffs Systems are a bit antiquated.

I tried reaching out to the Product Management leader for the products I used, and initially, she seemed open to my involvement in product requirements. However, when I eventually emailed the product team with a question, I faced immediate backlash from my boss' boss for contacting them, highlighting a disconnect between Operations and Product departments. Despite my efforts to secure a product management role, I found myself in a cycle of interviews for about 10-12 product positions. During one of these interviews, the hiring manager wanted to consider me for a Product Owner role, but I had to clarify that I hadn't previously worked in product management. This raised questions about the company's hiring process and their failure to acknowledge the information readily available on my resume. Throughout my time at Broadridge, my direct management seemed disengaged when I expressed my desire to move into product and not advance into Operations management. Additionally, the frequent turnover of first and second-level managers created a chaotic work environment, causing stress and affecting employee retention. To demonstrate my commitment to transitioning into product management, I took several blockchain courses and worked on a capstone use case project, collaborating with different teams to discuss potential opportunities. However, the lack of a streamlined process for turning ideas into action hindered any real progress. In the end, my experience at Broadridge was marked by frustration, financial setbacks, and a toll on my mental health. Despite my tenacity and problem-solving skills, the company's organizational barriers and lack of focus on true product work hampered my ability to pursue a fulfilling career path. Numerous conversations with PMs and leadership yielded little follow-through, and even efforts with the Human Resource Business Partner failed to result in any viable opportunities for career advancement. The company's overworked and stressed-out managers didn't inspire confidence in staying with the organization long-term. Compensation and room for growth Unsupportive upper management Not loyal to long term employees Constantly changing metrics Client Relations takes the brunt of all tasks and issues Continuous improvements and many layoffs Systems are a bit antiquated. Less Salary. Okay work. Job Satisfaction ? HR is a bit of a messSlightly above average salary and benefits Their aren’t any cons to the program They take advantage of you and then disregard you when new upper management arrives after a few years, with their high salaries. The new leadership believes they have a better idea than the previous one, resulting in hardworking employees losing their jobs to outsourcing in India. However, the quality of work and service suffers because the cheaper labor is of lower quality. Additionally, the remaining employees have to shoulder a heavier workload because the ""more for less"" workers in India require constant supervision and cannot work independently. I joined Broadridge with clear intentions of transitioning from Operations to Product, drawing upon my 10+ years of deep industry experience. At the time, I had recently moved to the area and had two small children. I had been actively interviewing for product management roles but hadn't progressed past the final round in previous attempts. Feeling optimistic about proving myself, I accepted an Operations role at Broadridge, expecting it to be a stepping stone toward Product, even though the salary offered was only $40,000. My first interaction with the Chief Product Officer (CPO) was hopeful, as he seemed surprised that I was encountering challenges in moving into Product given my industry experience and background working with product teams in other firms. He encouraged me to apply for product roles and even for a position reporting directly to him. However, when I submitted my application, it was rejected without an interview, citing a high number of strong applicants. Following his advice, I tried applying for non-senior level product roles to gain entry into the department.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Garmin-Reviews-E12667.htm,"I love working here. So many things to do outside of work. Very relaxed work environment. For the embedded industry there really isn't much better than Garmin. Benefits (401k, healthcare, ESPP, product discounts) are at the top of the industry and incredibly generous. There is a brand new on-site gym which is also nice. You can tell the company really cares about its employee's well being. In terms of a work environment, Garmin is an engineering company first and foremost. Lots of internal tools that are very high quality (I can only speak from aviation software but the internal testing tooling really made our life so much easier). Also the codebase was one of the cleanest i've ever worked with. It's a great place to start your career and a great place to stick to long term. They have a good mentoring program for new hires and there are many people here who have spent their entire career at Garmin. The work life balance here really cannot be beat. I left Garmin to be closer to family (see cons), but if not for that I would have absolutely stayed here long term, it really is that good. I cannot recommend Garmin enough Decent work-life balance. You can pretty much take pto when you want/need without much pushback Pretty decent discounts on most products Benefits! Product discounts! Salary! WFH for some. Overall values are progressive and employee focused. Decent work life balance, great benefits, flexibility. The health and retirement benefits are better than average at Garmin. These come from the corporate office in the midwest. My guess is the Maine office would never provide these benefits if it were up to them. - Benefits - Work life balance - Autonomy to tackle projects - Peers, co-workers, everyone is committed to a positive workplace Working on a diverse group of products.

They do offer a hybrid system (3 days in person, 2 at home), but no fully remote option. This wouldn't be a huge issue, however the HQ is based in Kansas City. If you are an outdoor person KC does not offer much + that midwest summer can be brutal. Extremely low pay compared to similar positions locally and nationally Management has changed its focus to profits over everything else, especially employee retention Department is extremely shorthanded, leading to heavy workloads There is almost no communication between departments or teams in the same department so there is always a disconnect between what management or marketing expects to get done, and what is actually feasible. I think they have a wonky interpretation of time off for salaried vis-a-vis having to take PTO for short doctors visits. Others for other companies are scratching their heads about it too. Little room for career advancement, pay doesn’t meet market standard for positions in other tech companies, get stuck doing work above your title & pay grade. Constant drinking required to fit in. The company doesn't have any kind of way to recognize a person joining or leaving, or getting promoted, and the engineering group has developed a culture of doing it on their own after work using alcohol. They even boast beer as part of the culture during the interview process. Large groups from Garmin drink together after work, and I am constantly terrified my husband is not going to make it home. He feels that he needs to do it in order to fit in, develop rapport with the other developers, and get promoted. The Yarmouth office is very controlling of employees, including not allowing them to work from home until they were absolutely forced because of Covid. I am filling this out for my husband, who started working at Garmin in Maine over a year ago. None to speak of at this time. Leadership doesn't focus enough on 'leading' the employees. Benefits are good, salaries are, ahem, modest but fair. But, I can't imagine a real a***ole working here for very long. The pay for experience in the post COVID landscape is low.

Benefits are good, salaries are, ahem, modest but fair. But, I can't imagine a real a***ole working here for very long. The pay for experience in the post COVID landscape is low. The KC area is expensive. Benefits do not cover daily cost of living.Pay could be a little better, but benefits are amazing. There is little flexibility for remote work. They do offer a hybrid system (3 days in person, 2 at home), but no fully remote option. This wouldn't be a huge issue, however the HQ is based in Kansas City. If you are an outdoor person KC does not offer much + that midwest summer can be brutal. Extremely low pay compared to similar positions locally and nationally Management has changed its focus to profits over everything else, especially employee retention Department is extremely shorthanded, leading to heavy workloads There is almost no communication between departments or teams in the same department so there is always a disconnect between what management or marketing expects to get done, and what is actually feasible. Constant drinking required to fit in. The company doesn't have any kind of way to recognize a person joining or leaving, or getting promoted, and the engineering group has developed a culture of doing it on their own after work using alcohol. They even boast beer as part of the culture during the interview process. Large groups from Garmin drink together after work, and I am constantly terrified my husband is not going to make it home.

The university is located in a good place and people are nice","Nothing really just wish salary was a little higher The University doesn't seem to understand that their Staff are the pillars that they stand upon. Staff are treated like second class citizens, especially by the medical doctors, but that's pretty universal. Also, ""Long Timer's Syndrome"" is definitely a thing at UK: Staff who've been here (and some faculty) for several years tend to lose that eagerness to see the job done well and instead develop a very poor team spirit (i.e. attitude/excuses when asked to do something additional to the normal job requirements). Pay could be a little higher Job was a bait and switch. Had me working in the position I was hired for for 2 months then eliminated the position and essentially did constructive dismissal forcing me to do menial tasks. Unfortunately I didn't know what constructive dismissal was at the time. When a person left their position and needed someone to cover, they slotted me in there. When it came to actually hiring a person for the position I had already been trained, working, and performing well in for months, they always passed me over. This happened multiple times. What else is bad about this place... oh, they're moving over to a performance-based system to save money on raises... terrible wages below market rate... 40% vacancy rate for positions while simultaneously trying to construct a new hospital. Where are they going to get the personnel? 😂 Other things of questionable legality I will leave out here (unless they remove this review). Really just a pathetic organization trying to ride the ""prestige"" of working for some large university. Just work anywhere else. The payment is low for the work As a non-profit, HDI runs lean and does not have the capital to pay salaries that would be competitive with for-profit companies. That said, the benefits package and the solid support and community are worth a lot. It's the most positive and supportive work environment I've ever experienced, with people covering for each other and helping each other out whenever there is a need. They have also listened to feedback and done what they could to narrow the salary gap. When I made a case that software engineering (the design of new software) was a different skill set from technical support work, they went to bat for me and created a software engineering position that paid a much better salary, and have included both raises and merit increases during my time here. Not great with proper compensation, - been here over a year and still waiting on a raise and promotion that was promised Being a people manager here is terrible. Employees know they can pretty much do what they want and there are zero consequences. There is very little personal accountability. The pay is pretty low but it's reliable. There really aren't many cons to think of Top heavy management- focus on patients can get lost in the “mix”Nothing really just wish salary was a little higher The University doesn't seem to understand that their Staff are the pillars that they stand upon.
