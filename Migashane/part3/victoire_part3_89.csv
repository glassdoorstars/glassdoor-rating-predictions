Even managers don't know where their direct reports are on salary or what bands even are. Frequent layoffs, even though the company is financially stable. But they don’t lay off any of the toxic team leads/managers. They say they are “one Korn Ferry” but I didn’t find this to be true. They don’t value good employees who are productive. I was laid off a team where I was a senior member and a high producer. There was a person on our team who literally complained all the time and another who had just been on the account for a few months. I was on the account for a year, promoted a positive team environment but I was the one let go, most likely because I was paid too much. I also had a couple of toxic team leads that did nothing to get me the career development I desired. Leadership was absolutely terrible. Very top heavy. Too many cooks in the kitchen not knowing how to implement good processes. Our account had 1 Project Director, 2 Project Managers, 4 Team Leads, & about 20-25 Recruiting Coordinators. I literally had the absolute worst 2 year experience due to the toxicity of leadership. They literally got rid of one toxic manager and then replaced them with another toxic manager. I’ve never experienced such an uncomfortable work environment like I did when I worked for KF. Team Leads are fake, talk badly about coordinators to other coordinators & they choose favorites. I would know, I was a favorite at the beginning. If you speak up, they make it blatantly clear that you’re on their sht list. I actually feel bad for the client because they have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes with the company they partnered with to do their hiring. 0/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND When I was hired in 2022 I was told Korn Ferry laid off during Covid, and would not lay off again due to the negative impact it had on the business. One year later, Korn Ferry conducted a total of 5 rounds of workforce reductions. My role was eliminated in 2023 along with several others. During my year of employment I had 3 different managers and did not receive one performance review. There is no work life balance. You are expected to work 24/7. Yes, even answering emails and working on the weekends at 2am. Stepping away from your desk for any amount of time to take a break was not possible. I would receive calls from my colleagues and leaders and was expected to answer them or else I would be harassed with messages to answer the calls. Management is terrible. This is a micromanagement work environment. Unprofessional and disrespectful leaders and colleagues. I went out on maternity leave and was only given 4 weeks of paid leave. I used 2 more weeks of my own PTO just to take care of my newborn and be a new mother. When I returned to work I was told there weren’t any projects available but one would be coming up for me to manage. 60 days after returning for maternity leave, I was contacted by HR notifying me that my position was eliminated. Lastly, there is inequity in compensation. As a project manager, I made the same amount as a recruiter. Building a network is key and can be very challenging for new hires. You need to know lots of people to get work done. Pat and benefits are very basic, including the 401k which is really bad. Frequent lay-offs; company preaches about valuing your people and even conducts learning and development training for clients on this very topic, but ultimately behaves the same as every other publicly owned firm; at the first sign of trouble cut the workforce. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a company. No support from the team, everyone was in blatant competition with each other. A very toxic workforce. Pay is not as high The ""leadership"" is more concerned with congratulating themselves about what amazing ""leaders"" they are than doing any actual work. They refuse to do any actual management so nothing functions smoothly. You'll have presidents and vice presidents who could be replaced with a mannequin and you'd have no idea. I have had members of the leadership team pressuring me to manipulate results to make them look good by giving our clients a misleading impression of how powerful our tools are. There's truly nowhere to turn when such ethical breaches happen - reporting them is career suicide and our president has zero interest in facts that make him unhappy. In these cases, if you don't want to pull a Theranos, you basically need to contrive some way of throwing the project & avoiding the fraudulent deliverable (and taking the fall for said malpractice project failing). Raising ethical concerns will have your career ended within a week. If you have a moral compass, Korn Ferry is a dead end job where standing up for yourself is strictly forbidden. As for agility and delivering results, that's a joke. They spend more time and energy in committees and meetings quibbling over trivial matters and inventing asine processes for the sake of inventing processes than they do on actually delivering tangible results. Finally, the nepotism is rife. The political climate is reminiscent of Mean Girls. You're either in with the popular (straight, white, wealthy, christian) kids, or you're a disposable serf.Very little transparency about performance management and compensation.

You need to know lots of people to get work done. Pat and benefits are very basic, including the 401k which is really bad. Leadership was absolutely terrible. Very top heavy.

I literally had the absolute worst 2 year experience due to the toxicity of leadership. They literally got rid of one toxic manager and then replaced them with another toxic manager. I’ve never experienced such an uncomfortable work environment like I did when I worked for KF. Team Leads are fake, talk badly about coordinators to other coordinators & they choose favorites.

It's very much like the movie Office Space with the TPS reports where you have 2 or 3 people telling you what you did wrong.

You’ll regret it like I did. Upper management is a clique. They’ll act nice to your face but will talk about you behind your back. If one of them doesn’t like something about you or your personality, you’re gone. Promotions are based on how much they like you, don’t listen to their drivel about “promoting based on talent” As a Management Trainee you are constantly talked down to and treated poorly. Managers everywhere to micromanage the life out of you. There’s more managers than regular employees. It's very much like the movie Office Space with the TPS reports where you have 2 or 3 people telling you what you did wrong. If your manager is an inconsiderate, insulting bully like mine was and you bring your concerns to upper management, upper management will always side with your manager and you’ll be labeled a problem employee. I’m honestly trying to warn you to stay away from this company. They don't view their employees as human beings. In terms of corporate greed, they're just as bad as Amazon but with worse infrastructure. Everyone is overworked, miserable and two-faced. If you’re less than 3 years out of college and looking for a Trainee Program, try Enterprise Rent a Car or Core & Main. They’re much better than this garbage. All in all, I would never recommend anyone with an ounce of self respect to endure the punishment of employment at this company and I would rather work at McDonalds or drive for Uber than ever come back here. Management is all over the place with what they want out of employees and it changes every month depending on how their bonus is effected. There is zero work life balance. as a salary employee your expected to contribute most your time at work and branch/district managers don't care about what you need as a supervisor to get the jobs done for the day and to plan future jobs. If there is an issue all blame falls on the supervisor and their solution is to work more hours or throw more mechanics at a situation . The management will make you take on more work than you’re being compensated for Same as any other trucking company, diapatch throttles your paychecks, driver facing cameras, you are a number ,hopefully your in good communication with your manager because there is no recourse if they dont like you. Aetna as your major medical plan insurance.Too many managers that don’t know the trade They don’t increase pay quickly you have a little son no contact or support with management unless they are calling you to do a review but when you have questions no one is available to assist or give support if a client calls and asked to speak to a manager no one will want to speak to them they give you PTO, but have a very strict policy that hinders you from actually using the PTO they are very strict with attendance which is expected, but calling out for the doctors with a note it’s still not accepted they tell you that it’s a four day a week 10 1/2 hour job but they will have mandatory overtime every month even though they tell you it’s not every month it is every month so you’re basically working five days a week for about 50 hours they don’t raise pay often they don’t promote often management is condescending actively looking for another job and also if you don’t do the overtime the pay is definitely not worth it. You’d be better off getting a lower stress less demanding job somewhere else. I want to have a coworker message me on Teams saying that she needed to vent about how stress this job makes her and how she feels trapped a person I’ve never spoken to you before but we have such a little support that was her only outlet Penske became WOKE. Poor leadership. No extreme ownership. The leadership seems to only care about metrics, and not the people who are actually doing the work. Insufficient pay for the schedule and hours they expect. They treat you like a number. They hire incompetent people. They just need bodies filling the roles within the company. They treat females, and LGTBQ people better than everyone else.

Horrible communication from the top down. If you ask three people the same question, you will get three different answers. This makes it super hard to be trained effectively when you start a new job because everyone is just winging it. 2. Low pay. If you are not proactive in department hopping, demanding a raise, etc. you will be stuck at the same wage for years. There are people that have been here for 10-20 years getting paid less than new grads. 3. The culture is soul sucking. Departments are usually under staffed, so everyone is doing two, three, fours jobs for the price of one. After a while, that starts to impact your mood. It is a never ending cycle of being overworked, you get burnt out, you become miserable to work with, and then rub off on the new people and they end up miserable and burnt out too. 4. You will get hired for one job and be expected to do completely unrelated tasks as well because the departments are too cheap to hire additional people 5. The parking sucks. You will have to walk up to 15 minutes everyday just to get to work, and this time is of course unpaid. 6. Little to no remote work available. Mandatory hour lunches. Bosses that will get you in trouble for coming in 5 minutes ""late"" to an office job (even if salaried). Very old school mindset when it comes to office culture.

They don't pay their staff enough money to afford gas let alone a one-bedroom apartment near campus that doesn't have a ton of students living in it. The cost of living in Orlando is extremely high now and the university refuses to match it. Also, the cost of parking is ridiculous. The fact that paying for parking is even a thing is already ridiculous. Charging people hundreds of dollars to do so is even worse. Low salaries, no consistent cost of living raises, lower level employees aren't replaced when there is turnover and job responsibilities continually get added to other employees without additional pay.

You were not expected to take a break especially when working evenings or overnights when no one else can cover the desk. Your downtime was contingent on how busy the season is. Inconsistent scheduling. No two weeks were the same hours. Very strict on overtime. Standards for the hotel have lowered since I started. As Front Desk you are often yelled at for being the bearer of bad news for inconveniences or policies that are out of your control. The pay is alright for what you do, BUT it’s not good in terms of the schedule. Be prepared to pretty much never get a weekend off, you will probably be called in more than you would like, and 3-11 schedule does get old pretty fast when you realize you just don’t have time for anything. The only real incentive to stay is the employee discount, which is good, but that’s not really saying much. You could get that at any hotel brand. Also, housekeeping is pretty much just high school drama 24/7. However since this is about the front desk it’s not a big deal, just gets old fast. Don’t make enough to pay my bills, struggling to survive. There is favoritism with the GM. GM treats people who are not white men harshly. The pay is too low for what we deal with. Our hotel is very old and the company that owns it refuses to update it. We have failed all except one month due to the conditional of the hotel. Ambridge Hospitality (our management company) also is impossible to reach. They truly don't care about us. Pay is low, hotel is virtually always understaffed and not for lack of available employees. Owners make little effort towards improvements in accommodations, they only care about profits. Management company - First Hospitality - does not offer career growth nor internal promotion opportunities for low-level employees because they do not want to pay employees for their labor. Everyone is expected to go above and beyond for the hotel and we do, but we get little in return from management. HR is difficult to get ahold of and issues often go unresolved for a long period of time. Health insurance isn't the greatest here The management and human resources is lacking. There is no chance of mobility here. Pay is very low for the amount of work we have to do. Every employee has to do work that is not part of their job description. Management does not care about your work life balance. Extra long hours … and not enough time to finish my work high stress and little work life balanceNot really many things to say The pay is alright for what you do, BUT it’s not good in terms of the schedule.

Only two 10 minute breaks for a full 9 hour day, you have to stay until *all* laundry is done which means you can be there from 8AM until past 10PM with just 2 breaks of ten minutes.

Health insurance isn't the greatest here high stress and little work life balanceNot really many things to say The pay is alright for what you do, BUT it’s not good in terms of the schedule. Be prepared to pretty much never get a weekend off, you will probably be called in more than you would like, and 3-11 schedule does get old pretty fast when you realize you just don’t have time for anything. The only real incentive to stay is the employee discount, which is good, but that’s not really saying much. You could get that at any hotel brand.

You were not expected to take a break especially when working evenings or overnights when no one else can cover the desk. Your downtime was contingent on how busy the season is. Inconsistent scheduling. No two weeks were the same hours. Very strict on overtime. Standards for the hotel have lowered since I started.

We have failed all except one month due to the conditional of the hotel. Ambridge Hospitality (our management company) also is impossible to reach. They truly don't care about us. Pay is low, hotel is virtually always understaffed and not for lack of available employees. Owners make little effort towards improvements in accommodations, they only care about profits. Management company - First Hospitality - does not offer career growth nor internal promotion opportunities for low-level employees because they do not want to pay employees for their labor.

You can do whatever you want Good company to learn about job and IT market","Vacation isn't paid. This is the most disappointing part about the company. When I initially started I didn’t get much support even with being a new recruiter until I got transferred to another department. With budget cuts globally work is very slow and skim amongst the recruiters and several have 0 assigned requisitions to work for days to weeks at a time. With pressure to get at least 3 placements a month, with 0 assigned requisitions, or you’ll be let go it can be a free for all fight for hires. Depends on the team supporting you (and their client team). I felt my first onboarding experience was awful - not very communicative, too many different links to fill out online forms, etc. My other onboarding experience was excellent. That team was great to work with. None for now; Would want to see how it goes once the current assignment ends Could use more recourses & training on the industry. Hard work, competitive, and that’s it but very rewarding Could be more paid holidays off Minimum wage to start. That is below everywhere else in the US. ""Promotions"" are limited and are really more just to boost morale, as a $0.50 pay raise doesn't motivate many people. Actual promotions to different positions I heard were not substantial either, especially for the extra workload you were given. Minimum bug reports per week. This incentivizes writing bugs about nothing that clogs up developer time instead of getting the important ones out of the way. This also has the unfortunate side effect of the devs not listening to advice as often. The breakroom has an entire wall just for paid snacks. Not an issue, if you don't mind always having that temptation there. I could not handle it myself, so it's going here :v Sometimes there's Mandatory OT, typically right before your project launches. The facilities are disgusting, including smelly bathrooms and sticky door handles There is little to no room for growth, and leadership is primarily hired externally Room for growth and cost of living adjustments were brought up in meetings and laughed at, this position is disrespected by anyone above a team lead Test Associates level 1 and 2 start at less than a dollar over minimum wage, and are rarely promoted to the 3rd level or to leadership, and while there is an opportunity for merit, a slight increase in pay, it is not a cost of living adjustment and can take up to 3 months to be reflected in your pay because the company moves quarterly Shifts are 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and there is only a 30 minute break for lunch when some companies provide an hour lunch break within the 9 to 5 window Company leadership fails to recognize the needs of the employees, and were not prepared for all of the people returning including parking lot overflow a significant walk away, offices for leadership being disconnected from their teams, and crowding in break rooms Lowish pay.

Projects can quickly be shut down. Limited training. Bonuses are possible, but at least on my project, the standards were always unobtainable. Some teams got PTO, some don't. Employee satisfaction was low on my team, and had fairly high turn over. (Everyone on my team left or was replaced at least one time in just over a year I was there, including a manager.) It seems that this company hires for bodies and lets employees go fairly quickly as in less than a year. The onboarding process is also lacking a lot of pertinent information needed to be successful.
