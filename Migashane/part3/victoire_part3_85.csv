Additionally, they claim there are amazing opportunities for growth, but what they really mean is free labor until you are burnt out and like I said before, you don't ever get paid for it or acknowledged during reviews.. only ""keep doing what you're doing."" Leaders are constantly changing goals and what they want, which also is a detriment to your goals. Pay raises are based on performance only, which wouldn't be a problem if they actually acknowledged your performance. Additionally, they changed all insurance coverage this past year, and what used to be amazing coverage is now the worst in my state. So bad that I need to pay out of pocket for all of my doctors. DEI is a joke. They pretended to care more during covid and slowly but surely minimized it all and allow mediocre white men who contribute only jargon to conversations to be managers and hold associates back from career growth barely got an inflation raise after a year of grinding working long hours. Sometimes you have to work weekends. Expected to work some times during your PTO Like any call center job it's sink or swim, a bit cutthroat. Not a good fit for everyone. You will be pushed to sell even if customer is not interested. Must have a positive attitude and be receptive to criticism to do well here. Leadership is toxic and mass layoffs are becoming the norm. The company does not appear to have stability in the marketplace and is very reactive. There are long-term employees that push out incredible talent because they see peers as competition due to improper leadership from the very top. There is a lack in definitive success metrics and extreme operational disorganization at the highest level which flows down and across all industries. They only pay $10 hour - they say $500 guaranteed commission for the first 6 months that’s a lie … I only received $500 (which is taxed) for the first month then they give excuses why you don’t get it after then …. I made a lot of sales for them just for them to not pay me for those commission sales as well. You are only given 2 sick days days off in 6 months.if you had a scheduled dr appointment with a note , that’s considered your sick day , emergency room visit ? That’s your sick day and you cannot miss any more days. You’re given a hour break but sometimes they take it and reduce it to 30 minutes because you’re “needed” you can never get in touch with anyone when you need them - overall do not recommend .. if so make it a temporary thing CNET used to be a good place to work, but then Red Ventures came in with no idea how to run this company. There is no direction from management. Layoffs happen regularly. Raises and promotions are only given based on annual reviews, but they rig the reviews scores to avoid giving raises and promotions. After scores are submitted by managers, upper management then lowers them. They then make up excuses and lie to your face about where those numbers came from. Red Ventures is not a good company, and CNET management has fallen under their cultish spell. Even lower level managers show little respect for their employees. They only look out for themselves. Customers verbally abuse you all day and have no idea why they are on the phone with you The wrong manager can make your life hell. Good managers get run off. Major issues in supporting diversity. Pretty much a checkbox, but to be expected. The culture at Red Ventures can be a bit much at times. I respect their emphasis on being an inclusive and supportive company. But the way they present their ideals can feel like virtue signaling. They love to do grandios presentations all about how supportive they are of under-represented groups that come off as more of a “look how great I am” type event, rather than a genuine love and support for the communities. The CEO regularly finds opportunities to tell us all how wonderful he is and how supportive he is of all communities. During the pandemic, he sent out weekly, company wide emails regarding the world events taking place at that time. Every email was a full page long and they described some way that Ric was the most supportive person on earth. They described how he has friends in minoroty groups, how we need to be during this time, how we are in this together and were overall just a giant sign saying “look how awesome I am”.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Yardi-Systems-Reviews-E31057.htm,"Great employee health insurance package and 401K. Celebration of employee culture and heritage. Company sponsored events, i.e. race, picnic, volunteer, etc. Guided collaboration with manager for future career build and path. Hybrid schedule work from home and minimum requirement going into office per month, allow work-life balance. Great work/life balance. Growth opportunities. The great benefits, flexible hybrid schedules, profit sharing, and awesome colleagues are a few things I enjoy the most! Yardi is a fast growing and large company that feels like small community which is quite nice. I appreciate the transparency and communication within Yardi and how stable the company is (great to get a steady flow of info at company wide with towns halls.) My role is interesting and my manager enables me to delve into things that are of interest and plays to my strong suits. They have a tuition program so people can take external professional classes and get reimbursed which is nice. My coworkers are genuine and friendly and it’s cool that the company seems to care about DEI efforts. Flexible, great salary & benefits, PTO, profit sharing, growth opportunities, supportive co-workers & Management, payroll, IT & HR Teams are awesome, cross team support is A-1, great balance between autonomy & team work, clarity in Company goals & expectations & caring people. Our employees & our clients are so intelligent, patient & work together to create the best products possible. Yardi Systems has some of the best employment benefits I have ever encountered. Hands down. The health insurance, vision, and dental really help me keep costs down when it comes to my expensive and unexpected medical treatments. Plus, the discounts you can access through the Yardi Perks program are great to check out in case you want to lower the cost of a move or take your family on a nice outing! I feel like Yardi values the well-being of their employees, and that's a huge plus for me! Tremendously positive work environment, even though there is a lot of work to be done. The culture at Yardi is amazing! Very supportive managers / team leads . Great benefits and pay is decent, work from home. I could go on and on about the benefits and beneplace. Basically fully remote, I went to the office once during my time there. Amazing Benefits, full employer paid if it’s just you. Decent PTO, understanding of family illnesses and other issues. Entry level positions are treated as entry level, great for career changers/fresh out of college Kind people who are genuine and caring. They hire extremely intelligent and kind individuals. Tuition reimbursement! Great culture of “trying”! If you try and ask for help you will get it. While there are undoubtedly significant issues with the company, not everything is entirely bleak. Some managers do show a genuine interest in their team's success and personal development. However, it's very much a gamble as to whether you'll land under the supervision of one of these rare individuals. Most often, the overall atmosphere is marked by low morale, a sentiment echoed across various departments. The sporadic presence of competent leadership does little to uplift the spirit of the team, as it's overshadowed by widespread dissatisfaction and disconnection from upper management. In essence, the potentially positive aspects of working here become overshadowed by an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and a generally negative environment.Great employee health insurance package and 401K.

Entry level positions are treated as entry level, great for career changers/fresh out of college Kind people who are genuine and caring. They hire extremely intelligent and kind individuals. Tuition reimbursement! Great culture of “trying”! If you try and ask for help you will get it. While there are undoubtedly significant issues with the company, not everything is entirely bleak. Some managers do show a genuine interest in their team's success and personal development. However, it's very much a gamble as to whether you'll land under the supervision of one of these rare individuals. Most often, the overall atmosphere is marked by low morale, a sentiment echoed across various departments. The sporadic presence of competent leadership does little to uplift the spirit of the team, as it's overshadowed by widespread dissatisfaction and disconnection from upper management. In essence, the potentially positive aspects of working here become overshadowed by an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and a generally negative environment.Great employee health insurance package and 401K. Celebration of employee culture and heritage. Company sponsored events, i.e. race, picnic, volunteer, etc. Guided collaboration with manager for future career build and path.

The great benefits, flexible hybrid schedules, profit sharing, and awesome colleagues are a few things I enjoy the most! Yardi is a fast growing and large company that feels like small community which is quite nice. I appreciate the transparency and communication within Yardi and how stable the company is (great to get a steady flow of info at company wide with towns halls.) My role is interesting and my manager enables me to delve into things that are of interest and plays to my strong suits.

Flexible, great salary & benefits, PTO, profit sharing, growth opportunities, supportive co-workers & Management, payroll, IT & HR Teams are awesome, cross team support is A-1, great balance between autonomy & team work, clarity in Company goals & expectations & caring people. Our employees & our clients are so intelligent, patient & work together to create the best products possible. Yardi Systems has some of the best employment benefits I have ever encountered. Hands down. The health insurance, vision, and dental really help me keep costs down when it comes to my expensive and unexpected medical treatments.

Not much else.","Office might be too cold from time to time by property management, not Yardi itself. None for me at the moment. The pay is fair but could be more competitive with industry norms (on the lower side for the SB area). I honestly can't think of any. Yardi TRULY listens to their employee's feedback and most importantly, implements change based on it. Yardi is currently going through a back-to-office transition. It is no longer possible to be fully remote. Since this is new, each department is handling this differently and has their own policies and requirements. I am not a fan of the uncertainty. They are trying to create career paths but it is still a work in progress. Pay for certain positions is below market for a company as big and successful as this one is. It’s difficult to learn all the technology , but you get a lot of help and support . None at the moment time. Leadership is literally like the wizard of oz. I saw my Actual manager once after my interview. Once. My team leader was a very sweet lady but struggled to articulate what was expected of us or what to do when there was nothing (empty queue, waiting on development) to do. Even at the end of my time there, she couldn’t quite explain what I was supposed to be doing. She needed more development of how to give effective feedback. As kind as the culture is, they teeter towards passive aggression. They struggle HEAVILY with giving good structured feedback. I was told I was doing good when I actively was not, I do not believe they would have ever told me I was doing poorly if had not asked about SPECIFIC goals. There was multiple times the new hires would gather together and just talk about how we were all lost on how we were going to meet our metrics. It was panic inducing. Because it’s so remote work leaning, you have to be working the WHOLE time. Every minute of the work day MUST be logged or it results in a PIP. Very anxiety inducing. Metrics don’t shift based on the amount of cases. Eg if your team of 10 people are expected to close 100 cases each and there is only 800 cases, they will not care and you get a PIP. Training is intensive but extremely poorly made. The onboarding modules are good but the classroom training is horrendous. It lacks engagement and is not helpful in the least bit. When I mentioned this to my team leader and mentor they said everyone ignores the training because it is useless. Working at Yardi Systems has unfortunately been a very disappointing experience, one that has left me struggling to find new employment and feeling extremely frustrated. The most glaring issue here is the management, or rather, the lack of proper management. From day one, I noticed a severe lack of communication, direction, and support. My concerns and questions were regularly brushed aside or ignored altogether. The hierarchical structure seemed disconnected from the realities of daily tasks, leading to an environment where it's almost impossible to thrive or grow. The attitude towards employee development is lackluster at best. There's an absence of guidance or any investment in training, which left me feeling stagnant in my role. Opportunities for growth or even constructive feedback were rare, and it often felt as though the management was more interested in maintaining the status quo rather than fostering an environment of continuous learning. As I began to search for new opportunities, I quickly realized that the reputation of the company has unfortunately followed me. Potential employers seem hesitant to hire someone with Yardi Systems on their resume, and I can't help but feel that my time here has negatively impacted my career prospects. In short, I would strongly advise anyone considering a position at Yardi Systems to think twice. The culture of poor management and lack of employee growth has not only marred my experience with the company but has also hindered my ability to move forward in my career. The promise of a fulfilling role quickly faded into the reality of a frustrating and demoralizing experience, one I hope others can avoid.Office might be too cold from time to time by property management, not Yardi itself.

There was multiple times the new hires would gather together and just talk about how we were all lost on how we were going to meet our metrics. It was panic inducing. Because it’s so remote work leaning, you have to be working the WHOLE time. Every minute of the work day MUST be logged or it results in a PIP. Very anxiety inducing. Metrics don’t shift based on the amount of cases. Eg if your team of 10 people are expected to close 100 cases each and there is only 800 cases, they will not care and you get a PIP. Training is intensive but extremely poorly made. The onboarding modules are good but the classroom training is horrendous. It lacks engagement and is not helpful in the least bit. When I mentioned this to my team leader and mentor they said everyone ignores the training because it is useless. Working at Yardi Systems has unfortunately been a very disappointing experience, one that has left me struggling to find new employment and feeling extremely frustrated. The most glaring issue here is the management, or rather, the lack of proper management. From day one, I noticed a severe lack of communication, direction, and support. My concerns and questions were regularly brushed aside or ignored altogether. The hierarchical structure seemed disconnected from the realities of daily tasks, leading to an environment where it's almost impossible to thrive or grow. The attitude towards employee development is lackluster at best. There's an absence of guidance or any investment in training, which left me feeling stagnant in my role. Opportunities for growth or even constructive feedback were rare, and it often felt as though the management was more interested in maintaining the status quo rather than fostering an environment of continuous learning. As I began to search for new opportunities, I quickly realized that the reputation of the company has unfortunately followed me. Potential employers seem hesitant to hire someone with Yardi Systems on their resume, and I can't help but feel that my time here has negatively impacted my career prospects. In short, I would strongly advise anyone considering a position at Yardi Systems to think twice. The culture of poor management and lack of employee growth has not only marred my experience with the company but has also hindered my ability to move forward in my career. The promise of a fulfilling role quickly faded into the reality of a frustrating and demoralizing experience, one I hope others can avoid.Office might be too cold from time to time by property management, not Yardi itself. None for me at the moment. The pay is fair but could be more competitive with industry norms (on the lower side for the SB area). I honestly can't think of any. Yardi TRULY listens to their employee's feedback and most importantly, implements change based on it. Yardi is currently going through a back-to-office transition. It is no longer possible to be fully remote. Since this is new, each department is handling this differently and has their own policies and requirements. I am not a fan of the uncertainty. They are trying to create career paths but it is still a work in progress. Pay for certain positions is below market for a company as big and successful as this one is. It’s difficult to learn all the technology , but you get a lot of help and support . None at the moment time. Leadership is literally like the wizard of oz. I saw my Actual manager once after my interview. Once. My team leader was a very sweet lady but struggled to articulate what was expected of us or what to do when there was nothing (empty queue, waiting on development) to do.

They've spent their whole careers at YARDI, resulting in a lack of fresh ideas or broader industry knowledge. Consequently, their flawed development process is painstakingly slow and ineffective, draining ten times the effort for every task. Expect to see your engineering skills wither away here. The senior engineers and managers, who are supposed to be the company's backbone, seem like they just graduated from coding boot camp. An additional concern is the apparent lack of diversity. The workforce is predominantly Indian, raising issues due to language barriers and reported rudeness. This is a company that must recognize the importance of diversity and inclusion, not just for its global image but for a healthier work environment. Finally, the atmosphere seems to be tainted with unnecessary hostility. This negative vibe can hinder creative collaboration and decrease employee morale, stifling potential growth and innovation. In conclusion, Yardi Systems is a textbook example of how not to run a software company. It's astonishing that they're still in business. This company must overhaul its management, encourage diversity, and foster a more collaborative and respectful work culture for any hope of improvement. - Minisule/non-competitive PTO and pay. - Will unapologetically overwork those who are salaried.

Work-life balance is hard. Especially with so little PTO. - They won't hire more people, so workloads are unrealistic. They'll gladly increase your workload to exceed 1 FTE load but refuse to pay more. - hardwork often goes unnoticed and there is so much unappreciation. - They lose so much talent because pay isn't competitive. - They do not promote retention (eg. poor pay, poor PTO policies). - To get full profit sharing, you have to be there three years. - a director in the ATL/CO office believes that you should work for free and does not value work/life balance. He sent out an email stating they onboarded too much work, overloaded people, couldn't keep up with the client's needs , so he mandated that everyone is REQUIRED to work 10-hour days until this is taken care of. - Some team leads are great. Others you can tell you're being burned out and they won't do a thing to help you. Some team leads don't care about the overall well being and burnout of their employees- The annual bonus is $500 even though the company is breaking over a billion dollars in revenue. - They (as in management/team leads) have little compassion or understanding for those who are going through sickness (such as cancer) or pregnancy. They will excessively pile on more work with no second thought. - The owner has very dated policies. Eg. You don't get more PTO until 5 years. Pay increases are minimal. - Culture is declining due to overworking and underpaying. - Growth is impossible and stringent. - pay scale is inconsistent. New associate Teams can come in and make more than a senior TAM. - Workload is unfair. There's other departments with significantly less work and much higher pay."

Management is not transparent about their plans. The Company is looking to outsource all of their work, so many employees and departments, myself included, have been or will be laid off if possible. Profit prioritized over employee and customer well-being. It pains me to say this, but working for VT has been a downhill slope for months now. By the end I was doing the work of three separate departments. In truth call volume was manageable, but the added responsibilities left us all very stretched thin. Finally, this last week they laid our entire team off, as well as many other teams. This was after we spent the previous 2 weeks training the ""new hires"" (unknown to us at the time, but suspected by some, our replacements) These new hires are international, and while we were getting paid around 19 an hour, these new hires would be doing the work of multiple teams for a whopping 8 dollars an hour.

Phone service decreased greatly due to the decrease in staff- weren't enough of us to do everything like we used to be able to do, which then upset tutors. We had little to no control and were bombarded with work. Quantity over quality. Micromanagement and always feeling like you're racing the clock and you just do X in X amount of time. If it isn't met, you're disappointing them and need review. After the most recent layoff, multiple departments were let go in a very transactional, emotionless way. Suddenly a meeting appeared on everyone's schedule and that was that. Immediately locked out of all access of accounts, like email and work computer programs.

Replaced by AI & folks outside of the US, and had us train them. Train. Our. Replacements. Increasing metrics over and over- but no further support for us. Verbal abuse over the phone with tutors.

What started as a chance to learn and grow, Soon turned to games, control's unyielding flow, Micromanaged, my duties multiplied, Resisting, questioned, made to subside. Incompetence rewarded, nepotism's glare, The inspired burnt out, burdened by despair, Growth without bounds, a flawed, unsustainable scheme, A crooked CEO, directors in a tarnished gleam. The managers, adrift, without a clue, Their lower ranks, the gaps, they must pursue. In layoffs three, I held a hopeful thread, That those remaining would their worth embed, But disappointment loomed, they chose to chase, More from clients, tutors' pay they'd debase. Disgusting act, to undervalue so, Employees robbed, their worth they overthrow, I erred in trust, believing in their might, Now certain of their imminent downfall's sight. The worst of all, their lies, a venom's sting, Assurances given, false hope they'd bring, In meetings, they concealed the looming dread, Deceived the few who stayed, their trust misled. Though business shifts, I grasp its shifting tide, Yet lies and pretense, in darkness, they reside, Evil veiled in false comfort's disguise, Lives shattered, livelihoods lost, the price. Their actions have wreaked havoc and despair, Ruined lives, once thriving, now laid bare, A stain upon their souls, forever marked, Their deceitful ways, forever stark. I think none. The only issues have been with technology but that can happen with any job regardless if you work from an office or from the comfort of your own home. Complete lack of respect. Expected to work late nights/weekends for low pay.

What started as a chance to learn and grow, Soon turned to games, control's unyielding flow, Micromanaged, my duties multiplied, Resisting, questioned, made to subside. Incompetence rewarded, nepotism's glare, The inspired burnt out, burdened by despair, Growth without bounds, a flawed, unsustainable scheme, A crooked CEO, directors in a tarnished gleam. The managers, adrift, without a clue, Their lower ranks, the gaps, they must pursue. In layoffs three, I held a hopeful thread, That those remaining would their worth embed, But disappointment loomed, they chose to chase, More from clients, tutors' pay they'd debase. Disgusting act, to undervalue so, Employees robbed, their worth they overthrow, I erred in trust, believing in their might, Now certain of their imminent downfall's sight. The worst of all, their lies, a venom's sting, Assurances given, false hope they'd bring, In meetings, they concealed the looming dread, Deceived the few who stayed, their trust misled. Though business shifts, I grasp its shifting tide, Yet lies and pretense, in darkness, they reside, Evil veiled in false comfort's disguise, Lives shattered, livelihoods lost, the price. Their actions have wreaked havoc and despair, Ruined lives, once thriving, now laid bare, A stain upon their souls, forever marked, Their deceitful ways, forever stark. I think none. The only issues have been with technology but that can happen with any job regardless if you work from an office or from the comfort of your own home. Complete lack of respect. Expected to work late nights/weekends for low pay. Management is very cliquey and there is little to no support."

I just live in a resort town so we are very busy all the way up until closing which just makes clean up and accomplishing our task lists take longer so we get out later. Being threatened to be fired for catching the flu right before Christmas. This place has mostly high school kids working and still demanded everyone come in when the roads were completely frozen and dangerous. Many were fired for no reason. Management is selfish and shameless. Corporate is even worse. fast food industry, customer service the pay isn't all that The franchisee’s control everything and will do what corporate doesn’t want and then corporate comes in often and wants you to do the opposite. The whole time you have to feel like you are walking on eggshells between being yelled at by the franchisees(MAPES) and then told to do something different by corporate the next. The MAPES is who i worked under so i dont know about the other franchisees in Arizona. They want you to prep any food that has gone expired so you don’t waste food. They will give you tiny bonuses and then require a lot to obtain a profit bonus. They under pay staff and tell them “they make tips so stop whining”. They don’t care about training new staff instead they would rather save on labor costs and have that new hire who knows nothing about the job be an employee right away. They make sure you have a labor goal that is very hard to achieve and will change the schedules you send them nonstop. Only con is working with teenagers who don’t take their job serious It can get busy but when it’s busy that means more tips so Nothing at all it’s pretty great for food service.

But it does not happen as easily as they promote it. - Wish there was a time we could get together since this is all remote! - Pay could be a bit higher with the market - Not sure of path in the future regarding promotions/direction of company Average pay, low Annual Merits, yearly goals that don't make much sense as there is no measurable logic applied, poor mid-management. Though there is a procedure for the new hires, nobody really pays attention to that; you are left on your own to either swim or sink. Starting as an apprentice meant a lesser starting salary, it can be hard to reach market level of compensation Corporate road blocks restrict creativity and recent restructuring has complicated operational tasks. Extremely long hours at times with no overtime compensation. Career growth/promotions are completely dependent on what team you are assigned. Pay is not competitive to the rest of the industry, benefits centered around flexibility and work/life balance became less meaningful post-COVID when everyone else offered them as well. Hard work and long hours if you struggle with multi-tasking A lot of virtual / remote employees which can congest getting things done Onboarding wasn't ideal - you're going to have to want to learn instead of just being ""shown"" things *Training specific to the agency processes and ways of working at the Director level isn't strong *New Employee are throw in the water and left to figure things out within a few weeks *Inconsistent team/account structure and processes *Instability with career advocates and direct reports - always changing so it's difficult to get any consist guidance *Roles/responsibilities are inconsistent or note defined on most accounts *Onboarding team leads are primarily ""Search"" focused or super high level folks making decisions or promising deliverables for channels that they don't have experience with so the display/social teams get put into sticky situations *Most accounts lack a true enforcer to place guardrails and enforce SLAs with the client *Teams are activation-focused so planning/strategy typically falls on one person (usually the Media Director) *Most teams work with PCs instead of Macs (this would be a pro if you like PCs) *Employees can be spread thin across multiple clients or overloaded with work on accounts where the Account leads/IMLs don't *Too many meetings - hardly any time to actually do work so end up working longer hours or missing deadlines *Small scopes with limited team support for Directors on most accounts *No bonuses *Promotions take at least 2 years unless you're really strong and deemed a flight risk I'm just going to make a bullet list to help the ease of reading. - Low Wages - Low Annual Merits (insultingly low annual raise) - Inept Leadership - There is no culture here so I'm not sure what other people are talking about.

It is very frustrating for a company to act as if they are one thing (Oracle, EMC, Microsoft) and uphold employees to this standard. A lot of people here are old and come here to hide (like IBM) until they can sail away into retirement. Internal disarray and inability to solve problems as a unified team. Great products, but terrible integration when it really comes down to execution. Individual Business Units are problematic and cause dissention with sales, Executives do not know how to handle splits and are greedy. Lazy sales people fish for leads in your deals in salesforce. Hiring dishonest mgmt from Oracle. Executives play favorites. CEO likes to have big meetings where he tells the company how great he is and how much money OT is making. When it comes time for annual pay increase, it's never in the budget. Company grows by buying other companies and using their maintenance revenue and not developing the products.

While it is true that an employer can fire you for any reason in Texas, using profanity or being a jerk is taking it a bit too far. I am all for firing people for cause but that doesnt happen here. Promotions are also not based on merit but on the rapport you have with C level execs. They dont mind working you late during month end and will literally lay a guilt trip on you if you do not work late (like 11pm or midnight) when they ask you to. All in all, stay informed.
