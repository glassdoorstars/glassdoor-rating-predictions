https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Memorial-Hermann-Health-System-Reviews-E4459.htm,"Great coworkers Wonderful Work environment Thoroughly enjoyed my work, good patient care experience Good PTO accrual system as far as hours Worked as a physical therapist at one of the sports clinics, and I loved my coworkers, loved my patients, and I have never had better benefits. Highly recommend working for Memorial Hermann. Usually a lot of down time. Flexible schedule. A lot of support when in the ER. Can be cross trained as a medical tech when there are no sitter needs. Good benefits. Good educational support (tuition reimbursement), even better support if you are wanting to become an RN. Company is PLSF eligible. Good people to work with Great coworkers-a team-oriented environment. Management was supportive for the most part. Great benefits, raise yearly, and great people to work with. Good education opportunities throughout the year Children’s Hospital is a great place to work!","Overall, I love working at this hospital. There isnt any cons i can think of Can be overwhelming with the amount of work we are responsible for Management will milk every single ounce of work they can out of you with very little pay. Raises are within 1 to 3% at the most that hardly allows to keep up with current cost of living. Pay for parking at some of the locations that you work at, there aren’t incentives for meeting your numbers every month Uncertainty about placement everyday (usually put in the ER). Uncertainty about patient temperament (some will be easy, some will be difficult, some will be a combination of both depending on the hour). Some unit charge nurses are stricter about sitter responsibilities/restrictions; differences in what is and isn't allowed for sitters to do depending on who is in charge of the unit. Lunch is contingent on someone else covering for you, so lunch time is variable (you will always get a lunch, but some days may need to remind staff to cover your break). Not as much support from staff up on the floors + longer response time from security since there is no post up on the floors. The pay could be better Often times very high caseloads. Very strict job performance expectations, this isn't a bad thing but if you don't have an eye for details when dealing with patient information. This would be for you. Wished the pt acuity was higher in ICU Staffing can be difficult at times. (All nursing deals with this)"

They managed to run a proud, homegrown Austin tech company into the ground, and now I hear NI is being bought by Emerson. This comes after the company has been floundering for years under Alex and Eric's leadership. Alex did such a bad job he left to go teach at the Red McCombs business school; I have no idea what he would actually teach, it certainly wouldn't be how to run a successful company. Key Point: During the pandemic when all tech companies were flush with cash as their stock values skyrocketed, NI's stock price stayed flat and even dropped. You have to be REALLY incompetent to screw up when everyone else was succeeding for just existing. Toxic management: Lots of middle managers who were just awful human beings. Cared more about getting promotions than doing a good job. Lied to their own teams constantly. I've seen (and been on the receiving end) of managers yelling and insulting employees in group meetings. Low Pay: Lowest pay for a tech company in Austin, by far. They could only pick up recent graduates; once you got a few years of experience you left to get better pay elsewhere. Broad-base means an employee can be asked to work on too many disparate things, need to work with manager to identify and protect some focus areas There seems to be silos within the company that could hinder career progress - Low compensation - Bad food - Layoffs - Mediocre Leadership team - Bad managers 1. Being acquired by Emerson Nothing comes to mind after a few years Since the original co-founder stepped down, the culture has gotten worse. Less and less morale overall, more focused on the customers than employees, annual layoffs (started only AFTER original co-founder stepped down as CEO), and reduced promotions and performance-based incentives.

Company politics sometimes with mgmt - Low compensation - Bad food - Layoffs - Mediocre Leadership team - Bad managers My first manager had worked here his entire career for over 15 years. He was controlling and would make us spend countless hours creating group PowerPoint slides. Very unproductive and boring work. I would be pulled into other group meetings to review costly team meeting services, as if these people had nothing better to do. Next, I find myself working for a short fellow with napoleonic syndrome. He would also make us create videos and presentations all week. He also worked here his entire career. I finally got fed up with the inbred culture and pushed back on all their ridiculousness. So happy to leave this dreadful and boring culture. The sale team thought they were a gift to this world. Broad-base means an employee can be asked to work on too many disparate things, need to work with manager to identify and protect some focus areas The company changed when the founder retired. Previously there was a clear attempt to balance the interests of shareholders, customers and employees - now it is clear that the company is extremely focused on shareholders. The message to employees for 5+ years is that leadership knows there is a compensation gap to market, and they want to close the gap, but there is always some 'headwind' that means there isn't enough money. However as soon as the stock price started to sink due to lack of profitability, the company suddenly found the funds to massively increase profitability within two years. This included laying off employees after their 'best financial year ever'. My opinion is that compensation will never increase until voluntary attrition increases, otherwise there is no incentive for leadership to close the compensation gap. With layoffs as the new normal, and the uncertainty of the ongoing acquisition, I would think most employees should at least be evaluating what options are out there. High level strategy is very short sighted and extremely centralized, I saw directors who didn't have the authority to decide the features going into their products. As a result, a lot of strategy decisions are made far away from the products themselves. There seems to be silos within the company that could hinder career progress too many to list in this review.Lack of in office workers - lack of headcount - low pay - not enough training - obvious preference of shareholders over employees Alex Davern and Eric Starkloff are two of the most incompetent leaders I've ever seen in my career so far.

Being acquired by Emerson Nothing comes to mind after a few years Since the original co-founder stepped down, the culture has gotten worse. Less and less morale overall, more focused on the customers than employees, annual layoffs (started only AFTER original co-founder stepped down as CEO), and reduced promotions and performance-based incentives. Depending on your perspective, a strong focus on DEIB since summer of 2020.Lack of in office workers - lack of headcount - low pay - not enough training - obvious preference of shareholders over employees Alex Davern and Eric Starkloff are two of the most incompetent leaders I've ever seen in my career so far. They managed to run a proud, homegrown Austin tech company into the ground, and now I hear NI is being bought by Emerson. This comes after the company has been floundering for years under Alex and Eric's leadership. Alex did such a bad job he left to go teach at the Red McCombs business school; I have no idea what he would actually teach, it certainly wouldn't be how to run a successful company. Key Point: During the pandemic when all tech companies were flush with cash as their stock values skyrocketed, NI's stock price stayed flat and even dropped. You have to be REALLY incompetent to screw up when everyone else was succeeding for just existing. Toxic management: Lots of middle managers who were just awful human beings.

Company politics sometimes with mgmt - Low compensation - Bad food - Layoffs - Mediocre Leadership team - Bad managers My first manager had worked here his entire career for over 15 years. He was controlling and would make us spend countless hours creating group PowerPoint slides. Very unproductive and boring work. I would be pulled into other group meetings to review costly team meeting services, as if these people had nothing better to do. Next, I find myself working for a short fellow with napoleonic syndrome. He would also make us create videos and presentations all week. He also worked here his entire career.

Broad-base means an employee can be asked to work on too many disparate things, need to work with manager to identify and protect some focus areas The company changed when the founder retired. Previously there was a clear attempt to balance the interests of shareholders, customers and employees - now it is clear that the company is extremely focused on shareholders. The message to employees for 5+ years is that leadership knows there is a compensation gap to market, and they want to close the gap, but there is always some 'headwind' that means there isn't enough money. However as soon as the stock price started to sink due to lack of profitability, the company suddenly found the funds to massively increase profitability within two years. This included laying off employees after their 'best financial year ever'. My opinion is that compensation will never increase until voluntary attrition increases, otherwise there is no incentive for leadership to close the compensation gap.

If you don't mind being just a number, then this is a textbook example of corporate swe life. They have great insurance cuz they'll keep you for 8hrs a day driving messing up your back. They'll have you do jobs where you're borderline trespassing properties. Unattainable work goals, no empathy for their employees.

For years, employees have asked for the ability to be able to work from home (not every day just the occasional one when needed), by almost every metric that costar loves to track the pandemic proved we could do that, and after a half hearted vaccination incentive program (where the winners were high ranking members of the company) the company said everyone needed to be in the office 5X a week after Memorial Day weekend. If you needed an exemption you had two weeks to figure it out. There was a lot of jaw dropping when we were told this. Respect also comes from making sure your teams are fully staffed. It’s a constantly growing company with way too many objectives it tries to accomplish at once. For example, I received a different role late last year, and was told my old position would be backfilled. I spent more than half a year simultaneously working both roles. Unless you have been at the company a decade or more its very hard to progress in your career at CoStar. Yes you might get a lateral promotion here and there, but when it comes to one day managing and leading people expect the company to go outside the firm to find them. Once they are hired very rarely will their “best practices” be implemented because the costar way is the only way.

Top-down management, sales compensation plan and performance management metrics that changed 4+ times each in the first half of 2023, limited autonomy or empowerment to make decisions at that market level, lack of quality training at the outset (even though 6 weeks in Richmond, VA is required) The main con I have really comes down the lack of respect the company has shown to its employees. For years, employees have asked for the ability to be able to work from home (not every day just the occasional one when needed), by almost every metric that costar loves to track the pandemic proved we could do that, and after a half hearted vaccination incentive program (where the winners were high ranking members of the company) the company said everyone needed to be in the office 5X a week after Memorial Day weekend. If you needed an exemption you had two weeks to figure it out. There was a lot of jaw dropping when we were told this. Respect also comes from making sure your teams are fully staffed. It’s a constantly growing company with way too many objectives it tries to accomplish at once. For example, I received a different role late last year, and was told my old position would be backfilled. I spent more than half a year simultaneously working both roles. Unless you have been at the company a decade or more its very hard to progress in your career at CoStar. Yes you might get a lateral promotion here and there, but when it comes to one day managing and leading people expect the company to go outside the firm to find them. Once they are hired very rarely will their “best practices” be implemented because the costar way is the only way. Micromanaging is insane, they want reps to do most of their demos in person even if you're doing great doing them virtually. Upper management doesn't do much motivating, but instead barks at us constantly. This company operates like a start up when it shouldn't be that way at all. The culture is TERRIBLE. Corporate bureaucracy nonsense Ending of hybrid work schedule Laid off with no warning after less than a yearHad to leave early , WTD - they own the building and make you pay for parking - no growth, promotions promised and not followed up on. - micromanagement: they track your location via your computer, audit your email/teams messaging, track when you use the restroom and for how long, - data is fake, quotas are enforced so hard people make things up to keep their jobs - they pay a ton of money to get awards like ""great employer"" from random lists - general lying and sweep it under the rug attitude. All the above is just the tip of the iceberg. The company will say it's not true and this was just a crazy unhappy ex-employee. However, there was an community of 1k+ who got together and shared their own horror stories not only to feel less alone, but also to show that places like Glassdoor didn't show the full picture.

Steep learning curve for the scale of the projects they are working on. team leads make you wonder how they ever got to be in positions of power. tread careful, do research and make a good first impression or your team lead will make your life difficult. when times are tough there is zero communication from management to everyone else. very corporate, and you remember how little you matter in the grand scheme of things. during times of layoff people disappeared with no notice -- had no idea if they were just on vacation or if they got the axe. witnessed people who did nothing keep their jobs while some of the hardest workers lost theirs. If you don't mind being just a number, then this is a textbook example of corporate swe life. They have great insurance cuz they'll keep you for 8hrs a day driving messing up your back. They'll have you do jobs where you're borderline trespassing properties. Unattainable work goals, no empathy for their employees. You can clearly see in the comments how they only respond to the positive reviews but not the bad ones.Had to leave early , WTD - they own the building and make you pay for parking - no growth, promotions promised and not followed up on. - micromanagement: they track your location via your computer, audit your email/teams messaging, track when you use the restroom and for how long, - data is fake, quotas are enforced so hard people make things up to keep their jobs - they pay a ton of money to get awards like ""great employer"" from random lists - general lying and sweep it under the rug attitude.

Terrible pay (10-15k less than other companies) Poorly managed hospital No competitive pay for CA's. No room for growth. This place will keep you stagnant and find every excuse not to promote you. The PER staff gets paid more than the CA's. Cliquey culture among nurses, paid less than other areas of the country Managers can be overbearing, inappropriate, bullying, and micromanaging. HR may choose to not do anything because managers hold more power in the organization, and in the case of principal investigators, they bring in a lot of grant money. One of the downsides of working there is that the pay could be better. This is a large, world class hospital and the therapy department is low on the food chain. Do no expect pay that reflects your time and effort, and the department its self does not value your personal goals as an employee - more of a cog in the wheel type of opportunity. The salary isn't quite market value. The raises don't keep up with inflation, and it's hard to move up the career ladder. Low pay for graduate degree.

Communicating with part-time reps, we learned some are earning only $15/hour in NYC, the minimum wage, some earn $16.50/hour, all are paid only $15/hour for travel time. A living salary for someone married with no kids in NYC, according to research by MIT, is close to $18/hour. The Northeast regional director confirmed that part-time sales representatives are not subject to performance reviews, nor are eligible for yearly merit increases. He also stated that part-time employees have no reason to expect to be paid an hourly living wage. In other words, be happy with your 25 cent raise after two years you lowly peon. Drive-time calculations are based on wildly optimistic estimates that assume no one is on the road during the day. When you change your drive-time to reflect the actual drive time, because it absolutely never takes 30 minutes to drive from the Bronx to Brooklyn, you get flagged and they ask for an explanation. Even though you already provided one. At the end of the day, Crossmark just does not value it's lowest paid employees and treats them poorly. They hassle you about expenses for parking garages that were only $4. They require a receipt for every little expense, including street parking of a $1. They reject expense reports with no explanation. They give no warning to employees about known gaps in service to their clients, but demand that you give them three weeks notice for taking time off. And the pay is terrible and they don't provide any equipment. Reps have to use their own cell phones or tablets. I never expected to make $30/hour doing this work, but I did expect to be given bumps in my rate as I gained more experience.

Not good if one or 2 people are getting overworked while everyone else has too little hours. - More coordination is needed between clients, project owners, supervisors and store managers on certain jobs and projects, such as building displays or pack out jobs. Store managers are not always on the same page for some reason, can be frustrating too as one can travel a ways to get to a store to build or audit certain displays only be to find out that the store managers don't want those displays built. Sometimes time of year can be a factor too where managers can get more picky about what displays get built and when (ie holidays, winter or summer seasons, store size and other factors). - Not the best primary job due to low hours.

Communicating with part-time reps, we learned some are earning only $15/hour in NYC, the minimum wage, some earn $16.50/hour, all are paid only $15/hour for travel time. A living salary for someone married with no kids in NYC, according to research by MIT, is close to $18/hour.

Drive-time calculations are based on wildly optimistic estimates that assume no one is on the road during the day.

Store managers are not always on the same page for some reason, can be frustrating too as one can travel a ways to get to a store to build or audit certain displays only be to find out that the store managers don't want those displays built.

I am a Fresh Hire with a ""Fresh Eyes"" approach along with working at the newest production facility at Tyson owns in Humboldt TN. One thing that impresses me is the amount of training involved for every position that tells me they make each jobs safety a top priority. We've all had that manager that has no idea how to do our job before. Well for my position as a Live Hual truck driver, you have to ride as passenger to train for the position, anywhere from a few days to a couple months. It took my supervisor 2 months before they let him drive. Job details** Every driver gets out helps each other secure and unsecure chicken coops when loading at the farms. ( Many hands makes light work!! ) I don't know if you know this but chickens poop. There's 4800 of them on a trailer load so it's a lot of butts.) The most difficult part about the position is remembering where all the farms are. There is a zero cellphone in your hand policy If your vehicle is in motion and you are driving. So if you have a problem keeping your phone out of your hand this probably isn't the position for you.( Again safety is priority It is not just you on the on the road) During orientation they give you every bit of information you want about the company and the benefits that they offer. If ""Manny"" doesn't know the answer to your question he will go find somebody within the company to find the answer for you. Loading and unloading as a driver your outdoors in the elements like rain, snow, chicken poop. If that isn't your cup of tea there maybe some other position there I'd talk to your leadership.

Breaks are cut shorter than advertised to maximize on production time. Management are Jerks, no understanding when it comes to being a minute or 2 late. Point system for attendance. Full point for calling off, only allowed 9.5 points, at 10 you are terminated. No sick days. Get poi Ted on family emergencies. As a mechanic you have to do monthly safety tests and have to move up levels to increase pay, but you have to have time to get to class during work day to advance through levels, good luck getting to class cause I could never go. There have been an awful lot of lay offs lately & tension. There is favoritism that makes it frustrating and hard to be noticed and feel appreciated within my department. Can't seem to keep the parts we need for big items in stock for repair. Claim a safety culture but I know at least 4 guys who got maimed (2 had to have amputation) because management pushed them to do a job unsafe.

Tysons does not care if you or your family is sick. They give false information at orientation that if you bring in a doctors note or have a family emergency that you will not be pointed. The point system however does not in fact take into consideration your health or that of family emergency health issues. My kids and myself all got sick with some unknown bacterial virus that caused me to have to take my children and myself to the er a few times and when I would bring in a note from the er doctor stating I was unable to work that day or the next, I still got pointed and got fired because I had to be out or leave early too many days because of my own health or that of my children. These should have been excused as told in orientation however they were not and I lost my health insurance for me and my children having to pay 800 dollars in medical bills because we had emergency issues that was effecting our bodies. Mine was making it hard to breathe in an extreme amount of pain, my son had issues with his private, and my daughter was losing wight unable to keep down any foods. I meant to put pro's in the cons. But oh well Many changes without knowing when the will happen."

Often, in this School in particular, the lack of strong leadership leads to turnover and sometimes a very toxic working environment. This isn't a disgruntled employee rant - this is a true problem that should be addressed as the School loses quality educators every year.

No chance of promotion or inclusion. Laydown, shut up cultural establishment. Leaders will give orders then put you on the flame if the orders were wrong.

Compensation is not great, Employee review system based off of SMART Goals that usually have little to do with the actual job and more to do with projects so you are not truly evaluated on your core performance. Be late once or twice and ask for a couple days off? The boss and senior manager do Not like you now. This is the third week i’ve worked 1 day a week. I get scheduled for more but about an hour before my shift they call me and tell me i can’t come. The boss will Not have your back if you’re being harassed by a coworker. My friend there had that problem and she’s been stuck alone in the box office ever since. This job is demanding and the poppers can burn you Badly. A lot of us have arms littered with scars from it. The senior manager is demeaning and will make you clean things 2 or 3 times if she‘s not satisfied. Rushes are sometimes so bad that you can’t even get a “hello” to the coworker 1 foot away from you all night. No overtime, no tips.

No allowance for clothing and clothing does get ruined even when you are careful. PTO is so hard to accrue and pay was pretty low.

Historically, athena has been able to create a strong, devoted, and loyal culture on site. It is harder to get to know people when you typically only interact with them during virtual meetings or through asynchronous communication. None that I can remember. * Dependent upon the department/division and possibly management: poor work/life balance. I knew some who did whatever they wanted all day and some who were on well after hours to meet deliverables * Pay is decent for entry-level work but is LOCATION BASED: those in higher COL areas will be paid better than those in lower COL areas. This goes for ~all levels of employment~: Senior Associates can make less than junior ones on the same team *Minimal in-office presence: with the shift to WFH, very few people are regularly in office if that is important to you. Beyond this, the Watertown office is being moved to a smaller location vs. skipping out on office space all together to cut utility costs and (in a perfect world) share those with employees I really wanted to love my role at athenahealth, but I had to leave to protect my mental health and send the strongest message I could up the management chain that things were just not right. I’d rather take my chances being unemployed in these economic conditions than spend another day in my role. :( Unfortunately, the only thing my manager was good at was fostering a toxic environment. This is evident from ongoing engagement survey results across their organization. Upper leadership preaches “authentic leadership” and “empathy” but this has fallen on deaf ears a level below. The person at this particular level is a manager NOT a leader. And that notion is unfortunately expected for people below them. If you step out of line, you are no longer a favorite and get treated accordingly. I truly hope there is positive change and it happens quickly. There are so many people who don’t have a choice but to stay and navigate the mess without becoming collateral damage themselves. It seems like management’s role here is very different and very unique to this company. I had higher hopes when I first met them. They delegate most all the coaching to other teammates and instead look at a few dashboards all day long. The tone and manner in which I was spoken to made me feel like the managers I dealt with expected a fair share of groveling and subservience. This was not the player-coach mentality that I was used to. I also noticed blatant favoritism and other political maneuvers on behalf of the management that shocked me. I did not enjoy the management style practiced by my business unit. As you grow into your career and earn more senior roles within the company, your monetary earnings do not increase as much as you would expect them to. You look at all your friends with the same job titles at different companies and realize they make significantly more than you do for less work. The culture is cute at first but then you see how phony it is after a little while. Also the baby-sitting and micro-management can be helpful if you are brand new, but no one could possibly need that many touch points from management if they actually know how to do their job. Looking at your calendar for the upcoming week on a Sunday night, almost the entire thing will be filled with useless meetings already. Many of these meetings you must attend are from different departments and could not possibly pertain to you. some work in monolith though we have moved out mostly to microservices, slow servers, team size has shrinked due to layoffs etc, more pressure and more oncall rotations as a result Not all of the people that were in the same role performed t the same level, nor were they held to the same standards. It depended on who your reported to and what they set for you as a goal. a lot of internal meetings, training not always structured or offered, expected to learn on your own, To go from SDR to SE you will need to study nights/weekends to prep Base salary could be higherLike many companies reassessing their organizations after COVID, athena is embracing a hybrid structure.

Work is constantly evolving in the EMR space so you must be able to pivot. This is a comment on the industry and would be the same for any company with a similar product.

The teams I work with are positive and helpful, and I have never had a bad manager here. My managers have always been very supportive and open, and I have received several promotions in the past 5 years. Depending on the position, ZB is also open to remote work and is not planning on requiring in-office work for many of it's workers. Company culture is focused on helping all of our team connect with the purpose of our work, and that means sharing the stories of patients who have been positively impacted by our technology. ZB also has a robust ESG program and has gone above and beyond most other companies on the ""environment"" portion - the company has funded a solar field in the US and in Europe and scored an A- on the Carbon Disclosure Project. It is a great place to work and rewarding to hear stories of how we help patients. Good pay with 401k match, bonuses and point based system that you redeem for products or gift cards. Great experience working with people. I have to admit Zimmer has been an amazing company. I really enjoy working here. No micromanaging. They trust your abilities to get the job done. They are family friendly. It's a mostly calm non-hectic environment and I feel fully supported by my team. We are a small team and work great together. I intend to be here a very long time. Everyone took pride in knowing they were helping others live their best lives with the products that were being produced. Environment, corporate support, coworkers, opportunity My boss is great. It makes a very big difference. The company really does do things in a consistent and thoughtful manner. They don't hesitate to invest in me. It's a very stable environment.

Truly a great place They suck every little bit of everything from you. What used to be an understanding, balanced work environment has since become controlling and tyrannical. The fact that a nonexempt employee who has spent countless hours of overtime now has to scan in and out of the office every time you go to get lunch or step out. They even had the audacity to tell us we can't go to doctors appointments on in office days. They try to sugarcoat everything with the fact that we ""still get two days WFH when most do not"" don't let it fool you. They have no loyalty to anyone but expect it in return. They will layoff anyone they have to to hit their bottom line. In the company, there is a notable absence of greetings among colleagues, leading to frequent awkward silences despite daily interactions in the office. Communication with management is inadequate, as my manager rarely engages in face-to-face conversations and primarily relies on Teams messenger, sometimes even neglecting basic greetings. The work process is disorganized, characterized by a lack of communication and clarity. The overall environment is not friendly, and there is a prevailing sense of job insecurity among employees, resulting in a tense and uneasy atmosphere. Long work hours when short staffed 1. The reason you'll experience comradery is because you'll find yourself constantly complaining about doing double work just for it to not get used in a meeting you won't be permitted to attend. 2. Leadership is indecisive and gives you tasks without knowing the details of said task. That's part of the reason so much double work is done. 3. Leadership will also throw urgent projects your way with minimal details and expect the project to be complete within a couple days (if not within 24 hrs). 4. The Merchandising team used to have social gatherings around the holidays and sometimes in the Summer to build trust and relationships within the team. Now the only time the Merchandising team gets together is for the quarterly ""Town Hall"" meetings to discuss how bad the company is doing and how they're going to make production more ""sustainable"". 5.

If you want to spend your workdays spinning to get things done, working until at least 11pm, and STRESSED OUT then TCP is the place for you. Part time employees get bare minimum of 10 or less hours. Will not get any help at all. You are the only one responsible for the team when manager slacks. Cleaning this store is a nightmare. Promotions go to those who work the least and show up late. You can do all the tasks and clean up after last shift and the people who work bare minimum get raises and promotions. Always understaffed because you don't get paid enough to care to stay. But don't worry, they will try to gaslight you into believing you need them more than they need you. You can work doubles and two weeks straight and get one day off and you can bet they will try to call you in on that day too. Staff is very catty amongst them and drama is high. The money, PTO, summer fridays are all meaningless with such a toxic work environment. For a while, depending who you had as your SLT, they were getting to a point where the toxicity was slowly getting going away. Surprise surprise when a head needs to roll they have no issue dumping ALL issues (across multiple departments) onto a single person that was pushing for change in culture. This company could be so much better but it never will unless there is a change in CEO. Super lean teams are not new and are encouraged by saying this is what we have to do and it’s good for your career. In most cases I do agree with that but at this company it all depends who you brown nose to. Treat this place as a stepping stone and bleed them dry and move on. You will learn ALOT but not because the company values growth, it’s all out of necessity to survive until you have another job lined up.

The work process is disorganized, characterized by a lack of communication and clarity. The overall environment is not friendly, and there is a prevailing sense of job insecurity among employees, resulting in a tense and uneasy atmosphere. 1. The reason you'll experience comradery is because you'll find yourself constantly complaining about doing double work just for it to not get used in a meeting you won't be permitted to attend. 2. Leadership is indecisive and gives you tasks without knowing the details of said task. That's part of the reason so much double work is done. 3. Leadership will also throw urgent projects your way with minimal details and expect the project to be complete within a couple days (if not within 24 hrs). 4. The Merchandising team used to have social gatherings around the holidays and sometimes in the Summer to build trust and relationships within the team. Now the only time the Merchandising team gets together is for the quarterly ""Town Hall"" meetings to discuss how bad the company is doing and how they're going to make production more ""sustainable"". 5. Overall this company is not doing well financially and their business practices are to blame. If you want to spend your workdays spinning to get things done, working until at least 11pm, and STRESSED OUT then TCP is the place for you. Part time employees get bare minimum of 10 or less hours. Will not get any help at all. You are the only one responsible for the team when manager slacks. Cleaning this store is a nightmare. Promotions go to those who work the least and show up late. You can do all the tasks and clean up after last shift and the people who work bare minimum get raises and promotions. Always understaffed because you don't get paid enough to care to stay. But don't worry, they will try to gaslight you into believing you need them more than they need you. You can work doubles and two weeks straight and get one day off and you can bet they will try to call you in on that day too. Staff is very catty amongst them and drama is high. The money, PTO, summer fridays are all meaningless with such a toxic work environment. For a while, depending who you had as your SLT, they were getting to a point where the toxicity was slowly getting going away. Surprise surprise when a head needs to roll they have no issue dumping ALL issues (across multiple departments) onto a single person that was pushing for change in culture. This company could be so much better but it never will unless there is a change in CEO. Super lean teams are not new and are encouraged by saying this is what we have to do and it’s good for your career. In most cases I do agree with that but at this company it all depends who you brown nose to. Treat this place as a stepping stone and bleed them dry and move on. You will learn ALOT but not because the company values growth, it’s all out of necessity to survive until you have another job lined up. Don’t give this company your all because most of the time it will go unseen. Apply at your own risk None at all. Truly a great place Regional managers isn't always there to support the manager, which kinda trickles down to the rest of the employees. short shifts, slow at times, messy tables from clients"

We never got a chance to fully develop anything with the constant turnover of deans. Strong high level leadership, great benefits, good work/life balance - Good networking opportunities - Great Campus - Well equipped lab Great place, beautiful views, lots to do A good way to gain teaching experience while working on your graduate degree. Salary with benefits. Excellent health benefits and paid leave and an atmosphere that supports employees' growth and wellbeing. The bureaucracy at such a large university uses such massive standardized forms and documents, that every single thing you do, you have to fill out forms, get them approved by your supervisor. Unfortunately, your supervisor can cancel anything you've planned and can pull the funding at the last minute is they see the money being better used on one of their own program.

Insurance cost was way to much they would take a third of your paycheck Management often moved shifts around from week to week, which made maintaining a consistent schedule difficult.

Overworked and unappreciated by management Work life balance is lip service Client service team appears to be overwhelmed! It often appeared they didn't have asense of urgency on new opportunities. Alignment between sales and service needs to improve. Not a ton of work, get lost in a large company Some departments treat you like a government mule. Pay isn’t up to par Pay is horrible compared to market standards. They constantly acted like there was opportunities for growth and only reduced the positions to send jobs overseas. Upper management is a joke. They host town square meetings where they small talk about vacationing overseas and their luxury lifestyles, however, they can’t justify raises for promotions and market adjustments.There are so many different groups.

San Diego is a paradise, however costs of living effects morale. Poor compensation. Our department resides in a facility that was a former shipping warehouse, now converted into a spartan setting where managers and supervisors offices see out to the ""production floor"" so they can keep tabs. Management has the uncanny ability to listen to every single piece of feedback from employees yet implement no change or at worst a change that was not suggested. People who have proven to be unable to show leadership are promoted into leadership positions. Workload is a constant jumble of overarching priorities and whatever is deemed important that hour.

Zero room or time for professional growth, if you are effective in your role you will be singled out to carry the workload. The company is slowly reeling back the Work from Home option and asking people to be in office more, largely run by older white men, at times uneven distribution of workloads, currently a slow down of business resulted in a few rounds of layoffs in the last few years Management is a ""good ol' boys"" club. Most managers lack emotional intelligence, often a lot of yelling and tantrums. As an individual contributor, you are not allowed to have an opinion, nor can you challenge poor decisions management often makes. It's highly militaristic, so anyone ""above"" you demands blind respect, but does not offer it in return. This environment is like a time capsule back to the 1950s. I think the worst part is that GA really thinks it's competitive, while offering the lowest salaries in the industry in a high cost of living area it can't actually afford to operate in. Pay inequality is rampant. There is a lot of lying and manipulation from senior management; they are not to be trusted. If you identify as a woman, run the other direction; the culture of GA is not conducive for women. Lack of direction. Management needs to get rid of the Good Ole Boy mentality. Poor management was the biggest issue and high turnover in HR Budget cuts contracts not coming through SAP behind a few years lots of single points of failure so hard to take time off Not as welcoming as other companies Growth opportunity is moderate Travel to and from various locations are sometimes asture.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Nestl%C3%A9-Purina-U-S-Reviews-E14081.htm,"Overall, I feel like Purina really cares about me as an individual. I'm consistently encouraged to take care of physical and mental safety/wellbeing and I feel like I'm a valuable part of the team as my authentic self. The challenging growth opportunities I've had so far show me that my leaders are not only listening to my goals and recognizing my skillset, but also that they are advocating for me and my development. I've had the support I need to get outside my comfort zone, and I know I've grown significantly (personally and professionally) as a result! It's very energizing and inspiring to work with my current teammates. Not only does it feel great to be a part of such a high-performing, passionate team, but the diversity in our team in all dimensions (experience, race, gender, etc.) means I am surrounded by mentors and role models, and I am constantly learning from my peers. One of the things I found most surprising and refreshing is that I truly do trust senior leaders within the organization to act with integrity, humility, and empathy. They don't just ""talk the talk"" when it comes to valuing and prioritizing people, and the messaging is consistent: we do the right thing, even if it's hard. I'm also very passionate about what Purina does! With previous companies, I haven't felt that same connection, and it can be disheartening and uninspiring. As a pet-owner myself, the fact that I can be a part of providing high-quality products to my own furry family members, and that I've seen the positive impact our products have on their lives, makes me feel like I'm part of something important and profound. Good pay and benefits. Overtime has even better pay. Large company that can offer diverse areas of development and growth within and broaden your knowledge. Money, benefits, 401k, most coworkers, and a handful of people in leadership positions. Work here if you have no social life or family but you want a boost in finances in a short period of time. It’s union which is both bad and good. Good insurance, pension and pay Benefits are good. Pay is okay Pay People Growth Benefits Work Life Balance Good pay and benefits. Overall most there are cooperative and professional. Market Leader in dog and cat food Honestly if you don't mind working in a manufacturing environment and depending what department you end up in (possibly dealing with raw wet meat) Nestle Purina as far as I know is probably the best manufacturing company to work for in the area. - High starting pay with opportunities for over time and double time. - All hourly employees are protected by a union. - Friendly team oriented environment. - Company pension and 401k plus quarterly safety bonuses.Overall, I feel like Purina really cares about me as an individual.

It’s union which is both bad and good.Overall, I feel like Purina really cares about me as an individual. I'm consistently encouraged to take care of physical and mental safety/wellbeing and I feel like I'm a valuable part of the team as my authentic self. The challenging growth opportunities I've had so far show me that my leaders are not only listening to my goals and recognizing my skillset, but also that they are advocating for me and my development. I've had the support I need to get outside my comfort zone, and I know I've grown significantly (personally and professionally) as a result! It's very energizing and inspiring to work with my current teammates. Not only does it feel great to be a part of such a high-performing, passionate team, but the diversity in our team in all dimensions (experience, race, gender, etc.) means I am surrounded by mentors and role models, and I am constantly learning from my peers. One of the things I found most surprising and refreshing is that I truly do trust senior leaders within the organization to act with integrity, humility, and empathy. They don't just ""talk the talk"" when it comes to valuing and prioritizing people, and the messaging is consistent: we do the right thing, even if it's hard. I'm also very passionate about what Purina does! With previous companies, I haven't felt that same connection, and it can be disheartening and uninspiring. As a pet-owner myself, the fact that I can be a part of providing high-quality products to my own furry family members, and that I've seen the positive impact our products have on their lives, makes me feel like I'm part of something important and profound.

You took competent people with years of experience and made them to feel like 'crap' by just assigning basic title and the let's not talk reporting structure. Did you do a people assessment to determine who has the experience to fit where and right reporting line? but right you couldn't be bothered because you have better things to do. There is widespread disappointment across the company and maybe will work out to your liking as people quit. When will whoever is responsible for this integration stand up and take note?? you have to meet people half way. You can't just decide people have to accept what you dish out.

No understanding of numbers are missed. Work life balance is also hard. They often brag about a “firm 40” but realistically this is often not the case. Lots of pressure and I mean a lot Lower pay than industry average, but still a good experience.There are only two things people really can complain about, everything else is either from a specific personal experience or they don't know what the real world is out there. Compensation and no working from home. But they are very blunt about it. They pay a bit below industry standard but it is so easy to climb the ladder if you are a competent person. In a little over a year, I've gotten a promotion and a raise and my team lead is endorsing me for another promotion in the next month. If you're a person who likes to bet on themselves and feels satisfaction from giving it your best everyday, this place is a no brainer.

Very high quotas to hit all in the name of fast closings Client communication is very toxic and is allowed to be by upper leadership in 90% of cases. Underwriters have 3 points of contact with clients and are often spammed at the same time on all 3. Phone calls are often spent trying to coach up inexperienced brokers and processors. During broker visits I have had brokers tell me they know nothing about underwriting and pay people (processors) to do everything so their visits are pretty useless outside of them getting free flights and food. Processors are often overworked and have limited knowledge of most guidelines and accuse underwriters of “killing deals” over federal regulation requirements.

Low pay Benefits were meh No short or long term disability Everyone hates their jobs and is stressed which results in a bad vibe CEO IS A CHACHE, kisses client behinds like its going out of style with weekly events.

Not enough support 4. Could fire people when they weren't slacking off consistently 5. Bad incentive Just have a good title but firefighting every day. Managers oversell what their team actually does. No scope for building skills. Pay was below-par for me though. High expectations for low pay, little to no trainings, software issues with programs constantly. No raises, no room for advancement. None at all that I can think of Bad thing is once i will start any work stop after finish it. Nothing that I can say Awful management. No training. Communication and collaboration lacks. Reality doesn’t match company “values”. No work life balance. A lot of stress and work too many hours to get the work done. Expect employees to work weekends and a lot of extra hours on short notice. A lot of pressure to get work done and only report a 40 hour work week so management can stay within their budget. They over work employees with little appreciation.

Easy job and work from home","no real cons come to mind, great experience overall. 100% commission is tough… gotta have thick skin Lack of official career ladders and review process to allow career growth for most eng Disconnect between upper management and engineers Disconnect between HR and engineering and too many hoops for budget allocations Poor healthcare benefits Not enough incentives to keep long term engineers, leading to a lack of subject matter expertise in many areas Engineers are spread too thin over too many things Too much tech debt not enough engineering innovation opportunities No raises. Unless you take a massive job change. Corporate leadership is indifferent to ground level workloads, or inept at lightening them. When talented people get job offers elsewhere, the company has taken the arrogant position of ""don't let the door hit you."" They used to recognize key talent and work to keep them. Over the past 3 years, the company has put enormous effort into devaluing every job role in an effort to standardize everything humanly (or digitally) possible. As a result, most newer staff is indifferent to the health of the company or quality of thier work. On call 24/7 for weeks at a time got old. Only 5 vacation days in the first 6 months. Slowly moving to in office again. This position was monotanous and I did not feel challenged. My team was compensated with gift cards rather than bonuses and we were taxed on them so our paychecks were lower and we had gift cards to places we didn't even enjoy. Cut our 401K matches as well and many in person events that brought the team together. Complicated process for evolving digital products at times. Must be self motivated. When you get hired, there are no raises, ever. Not even cost of living raises. You hit your ceiling day one. PTO is given annually up front. This means you don't earn it over time, so if you leave the company, you don't get that time off as money. You lose it. And if you don't use it for the year, it doesn't roll over. Company is in a financial crisis and has been laying people off since February. They have been doing it in small groups over time so that it doesn't hit the news. Senior leadership are a bunch of crooks. Out of the 4 years I was there, only 1 bonus was paid out. The other years they didn't pay because of COVID or the economy. Also, they stopped matching their 5% 401k matching all through COVID. Brought it back for a few months, then turned it back off again because of their negative financial situation. Toxic leadership.

This place is designed for people who are self-centered egotistical Type A individuals- if that's you then you'll likely love working there. But, it's a poor fit for most.

You really need to have patience. no work-life balance fast paced Could improve the new employee training program senior management disconnect at times Far in Jersey, CEO is always changing"

I got a call the day I was supposed to come in telling me I got ""termed for points"". Completely unprofessional. Tell you that they are making you full time and they don’t. Just keep hiring more part time people. As a flex supervisor, you are required to travel to different stores each day in your district. The issue is, Sheetz districts are very large. So before/after a 10-hour shift, you could be commuting an hour home both ways. I lived a little further with a lot of traffic, so I could be gone 13 hours a day. This did not provide a great work/life balance. I struggled to sleep, cook, and do my other responsibilities at home. I don’t see any after 6 years ! There is no cons when you work for Sheetz point system not many benefits more hours longer shifts and longer breaks needed Manager told me I'd never get rehired at sheetz, when I quit to go back to school Coworkers were rude, 2 of them had a romantic relationship and made it the whole store's business. (I understand not al sheetz are like this but my location specifically was BAD.) Understaffed and underpaid given the amount of work that is expected.More employees since it runs for 24/7 it needs more employees to help out the store Management likes to be fluid when it comes to professionalism and maturity. They will try to throw the book at you one minute over small things and then turn around and do something so completely unprofessional that they could have been sued. Management lied to all of us from day one stating as long as we had a doctor's note for any days we had to call out on or were late for, it would be fine. I started having health issues that resulted in my missing a lot of work and even an impromptu surgery. I had doc notes for everything. I pointed out and everything got sent to corporate. Turns out, they wouldn't except any of my doctor's notes that were for missing less than 3 days in a row, so the only doctor's note they excepted was for my surgery.

Poor leadership. Unrealistic expectations of workers who are stressed and struggling to keep workloads current. Antiquated work flows and business processes. Poor employee engagement and low morale. Attrition and lack of retention of qualified employees have made for higher dissatisfaction among employees. It's a large, bureaucratic government agency. SSA struggles to get out of its own way and makes just about everything harder than it needs to be. Perceived risks of change/modernization frequently carry more weight than customer or employee benefits for decision makers. My biggest complaint was lack of training. They basically throw you on the window first two weeks you are there. Overload you with work with very little pay. Worked there for a year I would not recommend it to anyone. All management thinks about is production. You will have a 6 month training program that you must pass in order to continue on with the job. The hiring staff will not tell you this at the time of the interview, nor will they tell you this once hired. The training process isn’t thorough and you it’s 3+ years of training crammed into a 6 month period. Once training is completed you will not be able to move onto a higher GS-pay scale until you’re off of review, even if you completed your 1 year probationary period. Upper management speaks to you as if you’re their children and they are absent 90% of the time so there’s no way for them to know how your work ethic and quality has increased or decreased. Some instructors will ignore your questions and want to see you fail so they suck up to upper management and get their “promotion”. There’s a reason that this agency is constantly getting sued and has such a high turnover rate. The pay is atrocious and should at least start at a 9 and continue to a 12. Run far away from SSA Stressful. Callers scream/yell/curse/call you names because of they had to wait to speak to someone and because they want to argue about ssa policies, which are available online. Not enough staff because of the knowledge that is needed, treatment from callers and pay. The pay is not worth it. Training does not come close to training everything. They throw you on the phone without the correct knowledge and sups listen to your calls and tell you everything that you did was wrong, One would think they would realize that a better training program needs to happen. They lost a large number of employees over the past few months. Have to work weekends but was not that bad. There are not enough people to do the work. This results in backlogs. Most employees are busy all day. This makes it difficult to train new employees, who feel overwhelmed. Management will run all kind of reports, but have no idea of what it takes to perform certain tasks. It’s all about politics. People should contact their congressman. It should not take 2-4 mos to get an appointment and then another year to hear whether a disability claim has been approved. Claimants will lose everything they own waiting for a medical decision. Politicians could pass legislation to shortcut some procedures, but they are busy blaming each other for the problems of the agency. It’s not aa terrible as most people say! You have to be dedicated and willing to work in a fast paced environment! Social Security laws can be complex, thus privatizing should not be an option. Things will get better when congressmen (all of them) do their jobs! The public deserves to be better served. The agency should find more dedicated employees.

No phones Remote Work life balance The major pro of this position is working remotely Great place to work before Microsoft Merger. Very rewarding. Great team and excellent management in my experience. I see a lot of complaints about training being too difficult. This job is not for everyone. It requires critical thinking and problem solving. It’s challenging, especially if you have no background. Training is designed to weed out those who aren’t good fit. This is a fantastic company, their expectations are absolutely realistic and wholly achievable. Management is amazing. I’ve never been disrespected or belittled. I don’t know where the poor reviews are coming from, but i suspect that those folks simply couldn’t do the job. That’s not the company’s fault! You need a strong background in medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, basic pharmacology, proper grammar, You have to be able to take an ambient conversation, pull out the important things, organize information, make it make sense, and make it accurate. I have decades of clinical and medical experience, including my RN. If you don’t have the skills, you won’t do well. Don’t blame the company. This is a wonderful place to work!!

MSFT ruined things in a big big way Hourly Pay Hours Training can be discouraging and harder than actual job The major con of this position is having to work overtime Everything!! Microsoft had to stick ther greedy grubby paws in and has destroyed them. They care about the bottom line that’s it. The entire operations team was dispensable to them so we were transitioned to another company. That’s over 1000 people. Till the day I die I will NEVER purchase another product from Microsoft and I will make sure my friends and family don’t either. The best advice I ca give you is stay away. Let this be proof that they place no value on their employees. The pay was not a living wage Microsoft merger and everyone is concerned about layoffs. None.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/loanDepot-Reviews-E375743.htm,"My team! I love working with the people on my team. They mean the world to me! My director, my manager, even working with others in different departments. I was lucky enough to help with different departments and learn new processes! The management team was very supportive and was there to help you with your challenging files. We used MS Teams to stay connected with our team for our remote environment. I could not have asked for a better group to work with. The health benefits were great and at the time, the company matched the 401K. Lastly, I generated great connections with some of the sales team members and the processors. Putting in the effort to create great business relationships with them goes a long way in helping them generate clean files and leading to smoother approvals. Remote work is available, not encouraged. Middle management can be good leaders and give constructive feedback. LoanDepot is such a great company to work for!!I’ve been here going on 2 years and time goes by when you love your job. If you love helping people reach their goal in the environment we’re in today LoanDepot is the place to be with that being said “HOME IS EVERYTHING”. Home is were the heart is so you also get to experience of working remotely and if you have loved ones they are going to love it.

Team LoanDepot is one big family always supporting one another to do better pushing you to reach your goal. The hours are great and you have the opportunity to make good money if you put the effort. You also have so many job opportunities here at LoanDepot to better your self in the company to move up and that is a plus!!!! Starting salary was competitive. Remote schedule was largely flexible. -Best technology in the industry leading to seamless experience for clients. - Best support staff on the back end, friendly learning environment for newer loan officers in the industry - Upper Management: Michael Guazon, Reza Abbasi, and Brad Montgomery are unmatched with supporting their loan officers. -Compensation plan is the best in the industry for a consumer direct platform. Remote, flexible hours depending on manager. When times were good there was the ability to earn good bonus. great place to work. Top to bottom leadership has your back and are there for you. MG, Reza and Alex are top tier. They make it possible to succeed. If you're in the industry this is the place to work. MG and Reza have created the ultimate culture, coming into work isn't something dreadful. Lose environment with realistic expectations. I loved my team & for the most part there was a good amount of respect & kindness shown between the organizations. I even liked my immediate Managers & Upper Management on a non-work-related level. When times are good the bonus structure can lean heavily toward your favor IF you are willing to grind everyday & on the weekends!! Which suited me & my style! This is truly a great company to work for.

My answers from my upper management: Usually after the 1st of the year, but we’ll have to see. Another: they usually happen after Q1. Reached out to HR to ask one last time yesterday. “The company does not have a standard schedule for review for increases. Unfortunately, that is not a company wide practice.” Like I said the housing market has its ups and downs (currently down) . And employees are definitely replaceable. But I have never ever worked at a huge company such as LoanDepot and not gotten at the very least a 3% raise? The company goes through a series of layoffs. My manager and director were let go. In addition, they wanted you to call the LOs if the decision was to suspend or deny the file to explain why and make suggestions before suspending it in the system. There was an update on the process of generating conditions that made it extremely difficult to easily choose conditions that met your needs. It was our biggest pain yet the most important part of completing your file. It was time consuming and frustrating as we were audited on the conditions that were chosen. Also, in the beginning there was opportunities to get your DE with them, however, that changed. Slowly the company began to show there was no advancement available in terms of broadening the loan types to underwrite. I would only recommend this company if you are seasoned, have another great source of income in your household outside of loanDepot and can handle change even when the change is not ready to be implemented and is anyway. Upper management comes in over the top of their managers and intimidates, and Boli’s workers. Harassment is rampant in accountability is non existent. You can go to HR and they never do anything about harassment at this company. You can document on until your blue in the face and they will never do anything and you’ll be living in fear of intimidation should your upper management find out. The upper management who is in charge of my division randomly picks on people to pick on and bully. They always changes their mind on tasks and process without telling you or giving you any notice and you have to record every single meeting with them because if you don’t, you will miss some thing and they will harass you and give you a horrible anxiety. I don’t have any thing bad to say nothing but great things that’s why I’m still here today. Don't be lured in by promises of an impressive salary. You have to be there long enough to collect it for that to matter. I should have ran when I attended my first town hall within the first month and the (then) CEO spent most of the time complaining about employees not working hard enough even though they largely had no impact on the reason for the company's issues (market). But I stuck around because of the numbers on my paycheck. Less than two years later I was finally caught up in the constant layoffs even though I was told from day one all the way up to and including that final call that I was a ""strong performer"". My position was outsourced to off-shore resources who I personally knew didn't have a fraction of my skills. I knew this because I'd spend the last several weeks interviewing them myself under the guise that we were actually trying to switch consulting agencies. Looks like that was all a lie. Bonus points to my boss for trying to get me sign on with that agency so that they could retain my talent but pay me way less. I wouldn't say there is any con about the workplace, what you input as effort is what you'll see as a direct correlation for your personal results. The opportunity is endless if you're willing to grind. UW Managers are afraid of UW leadership. Leadership doesn’t care about uws, don’t have uws backs, all allow uws to be berated and treated poorly by sales and processing. Ridiculous amount of micromanaging. Managers will give your loans to their ‘favorites’ and then threaten you for not hitting daily goal None. Obviously your results are based on your efforts. All the reviews that talk about work life balance are not true. The fairytale of working 4 hours per day and making $200k per year isn't real. Just like any sales job, you got to put in the work. loanDepot WILL reward you for it. Underwriting Senior Management would state repeatedly to the staff, “We don’t want you to underwrite scared”, however this is the environment they created. As a Production Underwriter you spend so much of your day re-finalizing loans over & over again. The process & flow to get the loan to a “Doc’s Out” status was extremely inefficient. It is not uncommon to have a file re-FINAL approved 5-6 times or more before finally making it to doc’s out! Due to all the recent rate hikes a reduction in workforce by any means was necessary was called for. It started with layoffs & then it transitioned to outright terminations. Of course, terminations would require a series of “disciplinary discussions & formal written notices” mostly made up of overreaching findings from the QC department taking much “deeper dives” into files than what is traditionally necessary. I really wanted to provide a fair & accurate assessment of “my own” experience working at Loan Depot & not sound like just another “disgruntled ex-employee”. I very much enjoyed working at Loan Depot up until 2023. Walking on “pins & needles” every day due to overreaching QC directives in the end wasn’t worth it any longer for me & in the end their antics proved to be just too exhausting on a day-to-day level & I just “didn’t care” any longer & consequently it showed. To summarize I went from a “Star” Underwriter to someone who no longer fit “their” quality standards mold. Remember this part because it can turn on you that fast at LD. I don't really have anything bad to say. If you show up and work, you will be rewarded.After helping different departments and working hard, I decided to ask about a possible raise at some point.

I would only recommend this company if you are seasoned, have another great source of income in your household outside of loanDepot and can handle change even when the change is not ready to be implemented and is anyway. Upper management comes in over the top of their managers and intimidates, and Boli’s workers. Harassment is rampant in accountability is non existent. You can go to HR and they never do anything about harassment at this company. You can document on until your blue in the face and they will never do anything and you’ll be living in fear of intimidation should your upper management find out. The upper management who is in charge of my division randomly picks on people to pick on and bully. They always changes their mind on tasks and process without telling you or giving you any notice and you have to record every single meeting with them because if you don’t, you will miss some thing and they will harass you and give you a horrible anxiety. I don’t have any thing bad to say nothing but great things that’s why I’m still here today. Don't be lured in by promises of an impressive salary. You have to be there long enough to collect it for that to matter. I should have ran when I attended my first town hall within the first month and the (then) CEO spent most of the time complaining about employees not working hard enough even though they largely had no impact on the reason for the company's issues (market). But I stuck around because of the numbers on my paycheck. Less than two years later I was finally caught up in the constant layoffs even though I was told from day one all the way up to and including that final call that I was a ""strong performer"". My position was outsourced to off-shore resources who I personally knew didn't have a fraction of my skills. I knew this because I'd spend the last several weeks interviewing them myself under the guise that we were actually trying to switch consulting agencies. Looks like that was all a lie. Bonus points to my boss for trying to get me sign on with that agency so that they could retain my talent but pay me way less. I wouldn't say there is any con about the workplace, what you input as effort is what you'll see as a direct correlation for your personal results. The opportunity is endless if you're willing to grind. UW Managers are afraid of UW leadership. Leadership doesn’t care about uws, don’t have uws backs, all allow uws to be berated and treated poorly by sales and processing. Ridiculous amount of micromanaging. Managers will give your loans to their ‘favorites’ and then threaten you for not hitting daily goal None. Obviously your results are based on your efforts. All the reviews that talk about work life balance are not true. The fairytale of working 4 hours per day and making $200k per year isn't real. Just like any sales job, you got to put in the work. loanDepot WILL reward you for it. Underwriting Senior Management would state repeatedly to the staff, “We don’t want you to underwrite scared”, however this is the environment they created. As a Production Underwriter you spend so much of your day re-finalizing loans over & over again. The process & flow to get the loan to a “Doc’s Out” status was extremely inefficient. It is not uncommon to have a file re-FINAL approved 5-6 times or more before finally making it to doc’s out! Due to all the recent rate hikes a reduction in workforce by any means was necessary was called for. It started with layoffs & then it transitioned to outright terminations. Of course, terminations would require a series of “disciplinary discussions & formal written notices” mostly made up of overreaching findings from the QC department taking much “deeper dives” into files than what is traditionally necessary. I really wanted to provide a fair & accurate assessment of “my own” experience working at Loan Depot & not sound like just another “disgruntled ex-employee”. I very much enjoyed working at Loan Depot up until 2023. Walking on “pins & needles” every day due to overreaching QC directives in the end wasn’t worth it any longer for me & in the end their antics proved to be just too exhausting on a day-to-day level & I just “didn’t care” any longer & consequently it showed. To summarize I went from a “Star” Underwriter to someone who no longer fit “their” quality standards mold. Remember this part because it can turn on you that fast at LD. I don't really have anything bad to say. If you show up and work, you will be rewarded.After helping different departments and working hard, I decided to ask about a possible raise at some point. My answers from my upper management: Usually after the 1st of the year, but we’ll have to see. Another: they usually happen after Q1. Reached out to HR to ask one last time yesterday. “The company does not have a standard schedule for review for increases. Unfortunately, that is not a company wide practice.” Like I said the housing market has its ups and downs (currently down) . And employees are definitely replaceable. But I have never ever worked at a huge company such as LoanDepot and not gotten at the very least a 3% raise? The company goes through a series of layoffs. My manager and director were let go. In addition, they wanted you to call the LOs if the decision was to suspend or deny the file to explain why and make suggestions before suspending it in the system. There was an update on the process of generating conditions that made it extremely difficult to easily choose conditions that met your needs. It was our biggest pain yet the most important part of completing your file. It was time consuming and frustrating as we were audited on the conditions that were chosen.

Majority of the managers were great, but with the one bad manager (had others do ""dirty work"" and take credit, make unprofessional and rude comments, etc) there was nothing done by the higher ups/HR to rectify the situation. Took actual years for any sort of investigation to begin. The company overhired by thousands during the ""refi boom."" Many of us tried to pitch the ""quality over quantity"" in terms of growth but we were obviously ignored and ultimately led to over 5 mass layoffs. micromanagement, managers not providing proper training Desire to ""disrupt"" extends to things that actually work well, too much action without planning, was once an open company now not so muchMacro environment is challenging right now - Poor to nonexistent company culture; we still don't have any core values (stated or otherwise) and leadership offers very little real transparency. Before the pandemic we at least sometimes went to bars with other coworkers, but we don't even have that now. Extremely cold and mercenary. - Individual innovation is discouraged. - Repeated, unexpected layoffs based on imperfect performance metrics. - Have to watch the internet react to said layoffs with calls to boycott the company, which would make stock options worth less than the taxes employees paid to exercise them. - Massive codebase; you have to learn a lot about refactoring at scale without causing fires. - Virtually nonexistent coaching towards real career growth. - Very low probability of any recognition for great work, fostering a culture of mediocrity. - This is, at the end of the day, a mortgage company. You aren't going to invent anything new here, just streamline business processes and integrate with third parties until your eyes bleed. The CEO, the company's ability to plan for the future, no mobility. Horrible leadership. Inexperienced and actively awful to it's people. Managers have no real power to help or influence your career. It doesn't seem that they will be around for long based on this botched SPAC merger. either someones closing is messed up or they don't know how to complete an application. you just don't know what type of call you're getting. also i worked there at a time where you didn't know if you would have a job the next morning so idk if things are still the same lol Sometimes have to stay overtime Sudden layoffs in the company.

If you sell and derive 10 account on some floors... guess what? They don't pay you on what you sold. They pay only when you reach a certain amount and it ends up being about 5% of what a minimum contract value will be. On top of that, they will force you to work more if you are doing well, and not allow you to work if you are doing poorly through their games they call the 'router' or dialer. It is not hard, it's easy money, but they guys behind it are sleazy. I found that Vivint doesn't understand what it takes to execute on technology. The leaders will make promises totally out of sync with reality, then ask team to execute which is essentially setting up the team for failure. On a separate note, the career growth and promotional track is extremely random and difficult to capture. There are very few examples of people getting promoted in Vivint and the ones that have, would be hard pressed to prove their worth except to having connections in the leadership outside of work. In my years at Vivint, I saw several good performers leave because of this specific frustration. A lot of politics is tricked to IC level with the acquisition and leadership is blank on the company direction. We want to do one thing one day and everything else the next. All in all, I wouldn't suggest taking up a job here unless you are out of options elsewhere. Vivint has a high turnover rate and the pay is low compared to the responsibility you have on the job. They will also send you home alot (MTO) as they are frequently over-staffed leaving you with an unstable paycheck and job. Adding onto the above statement--MTO is given directly related to your performance metrics along with staffing. You are expected to absolutely brown-nose the life out of every customer with their new QA score card. A call that seemingly sounds great on recording may be graded low, even if the customer was very satisfied with the resolution at the end of the call. This happens if you fail to hit certain qualifying expectations named in their scorecard ---like upselling a Vivint referral code to said customer for instance. The only con that comes to mind is that the company is very seasonal, so there are sprints and lulls; not every week has consistent workload. However, this is true in so many companies and Vivint's unlimited PTO allows you take advantage of the lulls. I have had my pay shorted, then had to fight for it on more than 1 occasion. Not recognized and looked over due to nepotism within the company to the point they have changed entire department names and umbrellas to give a family member a job over someone that meets all of the qualifications and the relative does not. To the point when they have changed the standing policy to have leadership roles in office ( a requirement to apply for the position) to all of a sudden given to someone who lives in a different state. On multiple occasions within the same department. Be ready to fight for yourself and the customers if you work here!!! Long hours Mentally challenging Tough conditions admins have accessed and changed my inventory without me knowing the company policy on a lot of customer interactions changes so frequently (though its usually minor stuff) became way more focused on metrics and sales than the customer customer service lines for both customers and techs is abysmal, I've been on hold for over an hour at a customers house for the other line to hang up while 'transferring' me and having to wait another half hour just to talk to someome and as a technician thats not hourly thats the worst Getting home from an install day at 1am. Benefits, some teams dont have remote options.Career growth can be difficult Bad if you like stable checks, positive environment and earning your wage. hese guys are thieves.

Be ready to fight for yourself and the customers if you work here!!! admins have accessed and changed my inventory without me knowing the company policy on a lot of customer interactions changes so frequently (though its usually minor stuff) became way more focused on metrics and sales than the customer customer service lines for both customers and techs is abysmal, I've been on hold for over an hour at a customers house for the other line to hang up while 'transferring' me and having to wait another half hour just to talk to someome and as a technician thats not hourly thats the worst None that I can think of The only con that comes to mind is that the company is very seasonal, so there are sprints and lulls; not every week has consistent workload. However, this is true in so many companies and Vivint's unlimited PTO allows you take advantage of the lulls. -Employees are treated as expendable robots. -Our hours have been getting cut, Mandatory Time Off, as a result of management's poor planning. -Constant pressure to offer referral codes to customers. Monitoring was never supposed to be about pushing sales. Long hours Mentally challenging Tough conditionsCareer growth can be difficult Bad if you like stable checks, positive environment and earning your wage. hese guys are thieves. If you sell and derive 10 account on some floors... guess what? They don't pay you on what you sold. They pay only when you reach a certain amount and it ends up being about 5% of what a minimum contract value will be. On top of that, they will force you to work more if you are doing well, and not allow you to work if you are doing poorly through their games they call the 'router' or dialer. It is not hard, it's easy money, but they guys behind it are sleazy. I found that Vivint doesn't understand what it takes to execute on technology. The leaders will make promises totally out of sync with reality, then ask team to execute which is essentially setting up the team for failure. On a separate note, the career growth and promotional track is extremely random and difficult to capture. There are very few examples of people getting promoted in Vivint and the ones that have, would be hard pressed to prove their worth except to having connections in the leadership outside of work. In my years at Vivint, I saw several good performers leave because of this specific frustration. A lot of politics is tricked to IC level with the acquisition and leadership is blank on the company direction. We want to do one thing one day and everything else the next. All in all, I wouldn't suggest taking up a job here unless you are out of options elsewhere. Vivint has a high turnover rate and the pay is low compared to the responsibility you have on the job. They will also send you home alot (MTO) as they are frequently over-staffed leaving you with an unstable paycheck and job. Adding onto the above statement--MTO is given directly related to your performance metrics along with staffing. You are expected to absolutely brown-nose the life out of every customer with their new QA score card. A call that seemingly sounds great on recording may be graded low, even if the customer was very satisfied with the resolution at the end of the call. This happens if you fail to hit certain qualifying expectations named in their scorecard ---like upselling a Vivint referral code to said customer for instance. The only con that comes to mind is that the company is very seasonal, so there are sprints and lulls; not every week has consistent workload. However, this is true in so many companies and Vivint's unlimited PTO allows you take advantage of the lulls. I have had my pay shorted, then had to fight for it on more than 1 occasion.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Paylocity-Reviews-E29987.htm,"- Flexible schedule - Great Culture - Supportive team and managers - Great training The team, the culture, the different activities, the clubs, DEIA initiatives, Compensation They provide healthy snacks everyday and lunch on Thursdays. Their benefits and training are great. Fair benefits, good products and tools. Benefits and 401k are good. They also have employee stock options. Work from home flexibility. They understand what being a team player is and means. I've been with Paylocity for several years now, and I must admit that I'm disappointed by the recent changes that have taken place within the company. It's hard to find much that are pros now. While it was once a place that prided itself on its strong emphasis on employee and customer experience, a noticeable shift has occurred ever since the arrival of the new Senior Vice President in Operations. In office perks like being fed twice a week, fully stocked kitchens with healthy eating options for free and an ice cream bar. There's also treadmill desks, a pool table, and massage chairs. Some really great people work there. Management is fair for the most part. It feels like the company cares about their employees at times, but the effort to show that is starting to wane. At first, I thought it was COVID, but we haven't really had COVID issues for about 2 years. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANYTHING POSITIVE WITH THIS COMPANY. Great coworkers. Lots of smart people to bounce ideas off, and haven't run into anyone I don't want to work with. Challenging work: The rate of growth creates lots of technical challenges, so there's lots of interesting work if you look for it. Work/life balance is outstanding. If I ever need to take time to deal with a personal issue, there's never pressure to get back to work. Steve Beauchamp (CEO) is fantastic. I've never seen anyone so passionate about creating a great product, and a great company. Still the best job I've ever had.- Flexible schedule - Great Culture - Supportive team and managers - Great training The team, the culture, the different activities, the clubs, DEIA initiatives, Compensation They provide healthy snacks everyday and lunch on Thursdays.

The way they handle raises is by having a set amount for the department. For example, they give management a set rate for each employee. If you have someone who does better than others, you have to take from someone else’s 3%. So if you get 6% that means someone else is getting less than the allotted 3%.

It seems that they are more concerned about their own reputation rather than doing what is right for our customers and employees. Employees are now working longer hours, off the clock because they are scared that they will get in trouble for OT and having a customer complaint. It's impossible to keep up with the expectations that leaders put all employees. One of the most disappointing aspects was this August merit cycle. Employees who are meeting the expectation of their job were not awarded their full bonus despite announcing to investors record 38% revenue growth. Those same employees only received a 2-3% increase in their base salary. It's frustrating to witness that even though Paylocity has achieved record profitability, the executives are primarily concerned with margins.

Management is biased and they divide employees. They have a bullying culture and do not care about employees' wellbeing. The HR is not there to protect employees; they are there to protect management! It's ironic that this is an HR software company. Management is essentially a cult.

They abuse their power to bully employees and silence them by switching them around and then pressing them to get business outcomes in a short period of time.

It is a bullying and hostile environment these people have created. I did not even think that it'd exist in the tech world! The last six months to a year have been really horrible. I have not been in Paylocity very long, but I have watched many people transition in and out of client services. The upper leadership meaning directors, senior directors, VPs, etc. are completely out of touch. This has turned into a complete call center rather then a client relationship driven place. We fix issues as they come up, not when they could have been prevented, and every executive wants it fixed immediately and wonders why we messed it up(Hint it’s cuz everyone good has quit and everyone left is annoyed or new). The culture and moral is worse then low, and I know this is across sites from friends in other places. Leadership is so lost on how we actually do our jobs that they change what we do every day.Leadership implemented client retention reporting systems quickly, but they are so far from reality about the horrible workforce they have. Pay is far below market and the industry. Raises this year were a slap in the face 3%. But oh wait we have almost 40% revenue growth. So instead of hiring better people and more people, they are removing WFH for us leads, paying awful, and hiring anybody and everybody who applies. Recruiters may talk like they vet, but the reality is you have low IQ Account Managers messing up your clients businesses. It’s really a disaster waiting to happen and many small ones happening each day. I would suggest getting a reality check on your team as it’s going awful. Internal opportunities don’t pay enough to justify moving, the only option is to take a job at a competitor if you like this type of Industry. I will be leaving as soon as I find another position where I don’t work 70 hour weeks. My time at Paylocity was marked by some concerning challenges, particularly in the areas of training and consistency. The training process, in particular, was disappointing and left much to be desired. With minimal training provided, it felt like there was a lack of investment in adequately preparing new hires like myself for our roles. The disorganized training sessions only added to the frustration, making it difficult to fully grasp essential concepts and strategies. One significant consequence of these training shortcomings was the high churn rate among sales directors. This constant turnover not only reflected a lack of stability within the company but also had a direct impact on the consistency of our sales efforts. With a revolving door of sales directors, each bringing their own methods and understanding of the company’s services, it became challenging to establish trust and build lasting relationships with clients. Addressing these issues is critical for the overall success of Paylocity. Investing in a more comprehensive and organized training program would undoubtedly result in more confident and effective employees. Additionally, tackling the high turnover rate among sales directors would go a long way in establishing a more stable and consistent approach to client interactions. In conclusion, my time at Paylocity was marred by inadequate training and a concerning turnover rate among sales directors. By prioritizing a more robust training program and working to retain experienced sales directors, Paylocity has the opportunity to create a more positive and stable work environment.None so far to report Constant change al the time You don’t have set working hours.

It's impossible to keep up with the expectations that leaders put all employees. One of the most disappointing aspects was this August merit cycle. Employees who are meeting the expectation of their job were not awarded their full bonus despite announcing to investors record 38% revenue growth. Those same employees only received a 2-3% increase in their base salary. It's frustrating to witness that even though Paylocity has achieved record profitability, the executives are primarily concerned with margins. The relentless pursuit of higher profits has taken precedence over the welfare of both employees and customers. This short-term focus on financial gains might have severe long-term consequences for the company's reputation and overall success. I'm paid under market value for my position but constantly tasked with doing more than my job description. With the type of job I have, I should be able to sustain myself, but I do have to work side hustles to afford my medication and rent due to inflation and the rising cost of living. After years of financial growth trending upwards, you would think the compensation would at least be above market level. I have never experienced an environment as toxic as Paylocity! Management is biased and they divide employees. They have a bullying culture and do not care about employees' wellbeing. The HR is not there to protect employees; they are there to protect management! It's ironic that this is an HR software company. Management is essentially a cult. They talk in echo-chamber and ignore disagreeing voices. They abuse their power to bully employees and silence them by switching them around and then pressing them to get business outcomes in a short period of time. When you fail, they blame you and said that you do not perform to their expectations. When you do perform by showing hard performance data, they simply brush it off and say that doesn't matter. It is a bullying and hostile environment these people have created. I did not even think that it'd exist in the tech world! The last six months to a year have been really horrible. I have not been in Paylocity very long, but I have watched many people transition in and out of client services. The upper leadership meaning directors, senior directors, VPs, etc. are completely out of touch. This has turned into a complete call center rather then a client relationship driven place. We fix issues as they come up, not when they could have been prevented, and every executive wants it fixed immediately and wonders why we messed it up(Hint it’s cuz everyone good has quit and everyone left is annoyed or new). The culture and moral is worse then low, and I know this is across sites from friends in other places. Leadership is so lost on how we actually do our jobs that they change what we do every day.Leadership implemented client retention reporting systems quickly, but they are so far from reality about the horrible workforce they have. Pay is far below market and the industry. Raises this year were a slap in the face 3%. But oh wait we have almost 40% revenue growth. So instead of hiring better people and more people, they are removing WFH for us leads, paying awful, and hiring anybody and everybody who applies. Recruiters may talk like they vet, but the reality is you have low IQ Account Managers messing up your clients businesses. It’s really a disaster waiting to happen and many small ones happening each day. I would suggest getting a reality check on your team as it’s going awful. Internal opportunities don’t pay enough to justify moving, the only option is to take a job at a competitor if you like this type of Industry. I will be leaving as soon as I find another position where I don’t work 70 hour weeks. My time at Paylocity was marked by some concerning challenges, particularly in the areas of training and consistency. The training process, in particular, was disappointing and left much to be desired. With minimal training provided, it felt like there was a lack of investment in adequately preparing new hires like myself for our roles. The disorganized training sessions only added to the frustration, making it difficult to fully grasp essential concepts and strategies. One significant consequence of these training shortcomings was the high churn rate among sales directors. This constant turnover not only reflected a lack of stability within the company but also had a direct impact on the consistency of our sales efforts. With a revolving door of sales directors, each bringing their own methods and understanding of the company’s services, it became challenging to establish trust and build lasting relationships with clients. Addressing these issues is critical for the overall success of Paylocity. Investing in a more comprehensive and organized training program would undoubtedly result in more confident and effective employees. Additionally, tackling the high turnover rate among sales directors would go a long way in establishing a more stable and consistent approach to client interactions. In conclusion, my time at Paylocity was marred by inadequate training and a concerning turnover rate among sales directors. By prioritizing a more robust training program and working to retain experienced sales directors, Paylocity has the opportunity to create a more positive and stable work environment.None so far to report Constant change al the time You don’t have set working hours. You will work until you’re off the phone with a customer which can be 10pm and beyond when you’re scheduled to leave at 6pm. Their managers don’t respect employees with families or children. The Account manager role is hard because the training never prepares you for what the client will call about and help doesn’t exist at times. Other positions their look great, my position as Account Manager 1 was awful. I left a week after my 11 week training because they wouldn’t accommodate me leaving at my specified time. Spoke to my manager about my concern and she stated my daughter was my problem and I needed to figure it out. During busy times they cut your lunch by 30 minutes and expect you to be on the phone immediately. They block out November through February for vacations. You have to be at work no matter what those days. I have been with Paylocity for a long time and the last 6 months has been a complete shift in management style, culture, values and workload. The new leader in Operations is completely out of touch with the workforce. It is very clear that they don't care about employees or keeping what made Paylocity such a wonderful place to work. Workload has become unreasonable and leaders keep asking to do more and get faster. Employees are unhappy which makes our customers unhappy too. Every email, phone call I shudder, knowing I’m going to get gutted by either a customer or my boss. More than 2/3 of my peers are looking for jobs outside of Paylocity, not just in my department but across the org. I can guarantee that in 1 year more than half the workforce will be new. I have been with Paylocity for 9 years and I’ve had enough with the politics. Raises are horrible. If you do good you’ll maybe get 3%. The way they handle raises is by having a set amount for the department. For example, they give management a set rate for each employee. If you have someone who does better than others, you have to take from someone else’s 3%. So if you get 6% that means someone else is getting less than the allotted 3%. The other downside of this model is that they never give raises to retain employees or when an employee requests one outside of compensation cycle. If I didn’t need the insurance I would leave in a heartbeat. None at this point in time. The vibrant atmosphere and sense of camaraderie have been replaced with an atmosphere of uncertainty and dissatisfaction. The feeling of being part of a united team has been compromised, and morale seems to be at an all-time low. Our inability to support customers because of bad product, tools and appropriate staffing have made it almost impossible to survive here. There is no more collaboration, everything is from a top-down approach. Ideation or feedback is almost non-existent. The new leader has been making swift changes in long withstanding policies in the organization, like remote work, promotions and customer experience. Making it more like ADP rather than the innovative SASS we once were. They are disconnected from our employee and customer experience. They roll out changes without input from employees. Leadership expects quick resolution on things rather than the right resolution. This causes a lot of rework for the front line employee. It seems that they are more concerned about their own reputation rather than doing what is right for our customers and employees.

They talk in echo-chamber and ignore disagreeing voices. They abuse their power to bully employees and silence them by switching them around and then pressing them to get business outcomes in a short period of time. When you fail, they blame you and said that you do not perform to their expectations. When you do perform by showing hard performance data, they simply brush it off and say that doesn't matter. It is a bullying and hostile environment these people have created. I did not even think that it'd exist in the tech world! The last six months to a year have been really horrible. I have not been in Paylocity very long, but I have watched many people transition in and out of client services. The upper leadership meaning directors, senior directors, VPs, etc. are completely out of touch. This has turned into a complete call center rather then a client relationship driven place. We fix issues as they come up, not when they could have been prevented, and every executive wants it fixed immediately and wonders why we messed it up(Hint it’s cuz everyone good has quit and everyone left is annoyed or new). The culture and moral is worse then low, and I know this is across sites from friends in other places. Leadership is so lost on how we actually do our jobs that they change what we do every day.Leadership implemented client retention reporting systems quickly, but they are so far from reality about the horrible workforce they have. Pay is far below market and the industry. Raises this year were a slap in the face 3%. But oh wait we have almost 40% revenue growth. So instead of hiring better people and more people, they are removing WFH for us leads, paying awful, and hiring anybody and everybody who applies. Recruiters may talk like they vet, but the reality is you have low IQ Account Managers messing up your clients businesses. It’s really a disaster waiting to happen and many small ones happening each day. I would suggest getting a reality check on your team as it’s going awful. Internal opportunities don’t pay enough to justify moving, the only option is to take a job at a competitor if you like this type of Industry. I will be leaving as soon as I find another position where I don’t work 70 hour weeks. My time at Paylocity was marked by some concerning challenges, particularly in the areas of training and consistency. The training process, in particular, was disappointing and left much to be desired. With minimal training provided, it felt like there was a lack of investment in adequately preparing new hires like myself for our roles. The disorganized training sessions only added to the frustration, making it difficult to fully grasp essential concepts and strategies. One significant consequence of these training shortcomings was the high churn rate among sales directors. This constant turnover not only reflected a lack of stability within the company but also had a direct impact on the consistency of our sales efforts. With a revolving door of sales directors, each bringing their own methods and understanding of the company’s services, it became challenging to establish trust and build lasting relationships with clients. Addressing these issues is critical for the overall success of Paylocity. Investing in a more comprehensive and organized training program would undoubtedly result in more confident and effective employees. Additionally, tackling the high turnover rate among sales directors would go a long way in establishing a more stable and consistent approach to client interactions. In conclusion, my time at Paylocity was marred by inadequate training and a concerning turnover rate among sales directors. By prioritizing a more robust training program and working to retain experienced sales directors, Paylocity has the opportunity to create a more positive and stable work environment.None so far to report Pay. Internal teams could be more willing to work with one and other. You don’t have set working hours. You will work until you’re off the phone with a customer which can be 10pm and beyond when you’re scheduled to leave at 6pm. Their managers don’t respect employees with families or children. The Account manager role is hard because the training never prepares you for what the client will call about and help doesn’t exist at times. Other positions their look great, my position as Account Manager 1 was awful. I left a week after my 11 week training because they wouldn’t accommodate me leaving at my specified time. Spoke to my manager about my concern and she stated my daughter was my problem and I needed to figure it out. During busy times they cut your lunch by 30 minutes and expect you to be on the phone immediately. They block out November through February for vacations. You have to be at work no matter what those days. I have been with Paylocity for a long time and the last 6 months has been a complete shift in management style, culture, values and workload. The new leader in Operations is completely out of touch with the workforce. It is very clear that they don't care about employees or keeping what made Paylocity such a wonderful place to work. Workload has become unreasonable and leaders keep asking to do more and get faster. Employees are unhappy which makes our customers unhappy too. Every email, phone call I shudder, knowing I’m going to get gutted by either a customer or my boss. More than 2/3 of my peers are looking for jobs outside of Paylocity, not just in my department but across the org. I can guarantee that in 1 year more than half the workforce will be new. I have been with Paylocity for 9 years and I’ve had enough with the politics. Raises are horrible. If you do good you’ll maybe get 3%. The way they handle raises is by having a set amount for the department. For example, they give management a set rate for each employee. If you have someone who does better than others, you have to take from someone else’s 3%. So if you get 6% that means someone else is getting less than the allotted 3%. The other downside of this model is that they never give raises to retain employees or when an employee requests one outside of compensation cycle. If I didn’t need the insurance I would leave in a heartbeat. The vibrant atmosphere and sense of camaraderie have been replaced with an atmosphere of uncertainty and dissatisfaction. The feeling of being part of a united team has been compromised, and morale seems to be at an all-time low. Our inability to support customers because of bad product, tools and appropriate staffing have made it almost impossible to survive here. There is no more collaboration, everything is from a top-down approach. Ideation or feedback is almost non-existent. The new leader has been making swift changes in long withstanding policies in the organization, like remote work, promotions and customer experience. Making it more like ADP rather than the innovative SASS we once were. They are disconnected from our employee and customer experience. They roll out changes without input from employees. Leadership expects quick resolution on things rather than the right resolution. This causes a lot of rework for the front line employee. It seems that they are more concerned about their own reputation rather than doing what is right for our customers and employees. Employees are now working longer hours, off the clock because they are scared that they will get in trouble for OT and having a customer complaint. It's impossible to keep up with the expectations that leaders put all employees. One of the most disappointing aspects was this August merit cycle. Employees who are meeting the expectation of their job were not awarded their full bonus despite announcing to investors record 38% revenue growth. Those same employees only received a 2-3% increase in their base salary. It's frustrating to witness that even though Paylocity has achieved record profitability, the executives are primarily concerned with margins. The relentless pursuit of higher profits has taken precedence over the welfare of both employees and customers. This short-term focus on financial gains might have severe long-term consequences for the company's reputation and overall success. I'm paid under market value for my position but constantly tasked with doing more than my job description. With the type of job I have, I should be able to sustain myself, but I do have to work side hustles to afford my medication and rent due to inflation and the rising cost of living. After years of financial growth trending upwards, you would think the compensation would at least be above market level. I have never experienced an environment as toxic as Paylocity! Management is biased and they divide employees. They have a bullying culture and do not care about employees' wellbeing. The HR is not there to protect employees; they are there to protect management! It's ironic that this is an HR software company. Management is essentially a cult. They talk in echo-chamber and ignore disagreeing voices.

It is a bullying and hostile environment these people have created. I did not even think that it'd exist in the tech world! Compensation is lagging. We're told how competitive our overall package is, but our teammates who leave report incredible pay hikes. I have a friend in software development who has essentially the same overall compensation package as myself... with 20 years less experience, and far less responsibilities. For many years we had insanely low turnover on the software development side--I've never seen anything like it. But the last couple years the amount of smart people leaving is worrisome. Micromanagement. Its hard to get out of department if you arent succeeding in sales which they said in training that if sales doesnt work out there would be lateral career options."
