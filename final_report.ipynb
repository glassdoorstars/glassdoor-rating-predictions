    "**Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, company reviews (pros and cons) on Glassdoor are analyzed and modelled using natural language processing techniques. The reviews are scraped on Glassdoor's most popular companies and the companies are grouped as 3-star and 4-star companies. After the data is acquired, the review contents are cleaned and prepared so they can be analyzed. Statistical analysis is done to identify words and phrases that make a company 3-star or 4-star. Lastly, NLP techniques and classification models will be used to predict whether a company is 3-star or 4-star based on the company's reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "- identify words and phrases that suggest whether a company is 3-star or 4-star.\n",
    "    - ideally, these words will represent positive and negative things about working for the company whether it be pay, work-life balance, or management.\n",
    "- build a machine learning classification model that will accurately predict whether a company is 3-star or 4-star."
