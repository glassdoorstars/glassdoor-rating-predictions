company,pros,cons
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Asurion-Reviews-E16924.htm,"Good place to work at
If your perform well and apply feedback, you’ll improve. Local culture can be very good with engaged management.
Fast paced, room for growth, changes in scenery, benefits include company compensated access to ubreakifix. Extremely generous mileage compensation, decent health plan.
Diversity - Asurion is easily the most diverse corporation I have been with, from race, ethnicity, age, gender and sexual orientation. The organization transparently updates all employees with progress and offers vast employee resource groups and clubs to join. This diversity brings the best ideas to the table. Results driven - Asurion values its people and the results they bring. If you treat others with respect and produce results, you will have a great career here. Fast - Asurion is a massive company with a lot of people, but it doesn't take long for great decisions to get action within your team or partner teams. Everyone is running in the same direction and accept great ideas no matter where they come from. There's even a place for ANY employee to suggest ideas and process improvements to the C suite. People - There's a theme here with people. From the interview process to the onboarding process to the continuing education inside the building - this is a company that really, really cares. People are recognized and celebrated for their successes. It helps develop a culture of the behaviors we celebrate so employees can model. Amenities - The corporate HQ is gorgeous and modern. Ergonomic, state-of-the-art gym and dining, and amazing collaboration spaces.
Freedom of driving to new places, only deal with 8 customers a day good pay, not a good position if you have children and family. Get off late often overworked and lots of pressure to sell. Commission sucks. Hourly is average and benefits are great. Get paid mileage and hours. Overtime is allowed if legitimate.
Pay is decent for required work
There are great pockets of people within the company if you happen to be in one of these then you life is going to be easy here. all of the cheesy things said and done in public there are people that really live those values
Great people, reasonably understanding and flexible with schedule, decent pay rate and benefits. I work 100% remotely which is my preference, my team's home base is in a different city/state than where I live. Monthly performance based bonuses. Abundant incentives and employee groups to join. I do not perform any sales in my current role.
Lots of resources and helpful managers
Great pay and benefits for the position
Pay is decent for required work
Good starting salary and benefits.
Great work environment, tips, a little bit of freedom since your driving the van
Worked the chat platform so didn't have to talk on the phone with anyone, work from home, could easily move your work shift around as needed
Good benefits, reasonable salary, parental leave and PTO are solid. Diversity is good on the surface level, but no room for advancement at the end of the day unless you are a white male.

Flexible hours, work isn’t hard, easy to do school work while there, and you can make good money if you are good at sales.
Pay is good for what you have to do
Great pay and benefits for the position
The low call volume on night shift. Free coffee and tea. Sometimes even cereal and ramen! Made some friends that I miss. I learned great lessons about how to work with other people from different backgrounds in a very confined area
Work location flexibility, competitive salaries for new employees, unlimited PTO (depends on role how often you can use it)
Travel, company peridium, Teamwork, Benefits
They offered a lot of VTO and PTO They were understanding when you had things to do and needed to take off

Flexible schedule . No set time to come in or leave
Decent pay and solid leadership develop program
Very Generous Company, energetic and young culture.
Covered Parking ,friendly employees, large break room

Best tech job I've worked with. Great coworkers, busy days, not enough pay.
working from home was the only pro because pay was a slap in the face
My store had a fun team.
The pay is GREAT! Over $24 an hr plus bonus for meeting goals. The benefits are also great! 2 wells of to start PLUS 5 floating holidays on top of that! The insurance for health and etc is good as well and they give you many options to choose from. Work life balance is amazing too! Maybe it's because my manager is also amazing but I really love working for this company.
There are none they don’t care
Pay was decent, but thats about it
I learned a lot while at Asurion and was able to carry over many skills I learned there to higher paying positions with other companies.

Good work is rarely rewarded, but this means you be terrible, do the bare minimum and get praised lol

Shift variety, remote opportunities, paid training.
Good bonuses you could get each month

Hours are pretty good and you work remotely
There are nice people in the company and at times you can find a team with good culture. Doesn't pay terribly higher up but doesn't mind paying entry level roles at minimum wage. Unlivable wages in certain cities.

I worked in a pretty solid department. The people were great. I give my coworkers and direct supervisor a 5/5. However, that will not be the case company wide. I'd check out reddit to see more on what it is like working there.

","No cons to speech of.
If the feedback is vague, non existent, or lacks direction, you are still responsible for your performance. Going above and beyond in other areas are not considered and equality of performance between team types and tenure are not considered. Pay is based on region not performance. Lack of accountability amongst teams site to site. Closure of sites. Lack of growth opportunities if not in Nashville.
I worked there 6 months and it went from a customer focused service to deliver and set up electronics to a sales position. The commissions are pitiful, at most $25/sale and their rules about trying to record people in their own homes make customers very uncomfortable and distrustful, and since you aren't allowed to contact customers after the deliveries you're given no opportunity to save a cancellation, but the company still counts them against you. I was #1 salesman in the region for 3 months, even met the ceo and had a photo op, but because my numbers were good they gave me more stops on my route, which I appreciated, however, since I was then seeing 2x the customers as my fellow teammates, my numbers skyrocketed despite the percentages remaining reasonable albeit ahead. I have prior sales experiences which was why I was successful to begin with. Then, witb no warning whatsoever, I was placed on unpaid administrative leave while the company investigated my sales tactics, I wasn't asked to give any statements or elaborations and after the ""administrative leave"" the company completely ghosted me. I never got any resolution whatsoever. This job is, in my opinion, extremely volatile and I strongly recommend against working here as you can be terminated either for not making enough sales, or apparently, making too many.
Not many Cons. Once you get a company that cares this much about its people, stay. You'll find a lot of people who have been here for a long time.
Remote support is not very good especially if you are new. No stock options, low-ball commission, no bonus, can't make it to 80 hours. Have to use mileage reimbursement as supplemental income. Use your own vehicle and devices for work.
Sometimes long work hours daily
The duality of this is that there are wolves in sheep clothing that act like the values here matter and then turn around and undercut at every turn. We hide information from the general workforce for months knowing it will negatively impact everyone's lives while telling them we are one team and we care its nonsense.
Lack of interdepartmental communication is the biggest issue I experience affecting my ability to do my job. I wish we were able to get a cost of living pay adjustment, the company provided a market adjustment in 2020. I have previously suggested opening the opportunity to request unpaid time off. One of my greatest concerns is a lack of remote opportunities to advance my career within Asurion, also I am unable to travel with my work away from my physical home address due to the client restrictions.
Pay is kinda low for crappy hours
The amount of work that had to be done documenting
Sometimes long work hours daily
Lots of layoffs. Remote work is going away. Director positions and above are nepotistic. Diversity and inclusion are talked about a lot, but this is a ""good-ole-boy network"".
Long hours, no insurance, low pay
They really wanted us to be sales reps, that became the main focus! No longer customer-oriented, complete disregard for customers' needs unless you got a bad survey or bad quality score, then management would act like they cared about the customers' experience, just sell sell sell...
Leadership does not care about its people. When a new leader comes into your department, they will micromanage you and gaslight you until you are so miserable that you quit. White males are the only ones who get ahead. They force people to work in person even when that creates great hardship.

Inconsistent communication between management, numerous changes,
The lack of prioritization by Sr. Leadership is real. When everything is a “priority”, nothing is. Nothing was done to adjust volume of work, even with layoffs and attrition. Sr. Leaders just expect you/your team members to do the work of 2-3 people with no change in compensation.
no phones at all only 30 min lunch breaks
Pay is kinda low for crappy hours
Sales is everything does not matter what you can fix as long as you can sell the insurance.
No job security. They set impossible expectations and and get mad when you don't meet goal. You are constantly reminded that your job is in Jeopardy at all times. Every aspect of management is an absolute joke
The amount of work that had to be done documenting
Terrible culture. Very much a click orienteered structure. You could tell who was with who.
Negatively competitive atmosphere. Teams compete with each other in order to ""prove themselves' and wind up just creating double work. In doing so, innovation as stagnated. The core business model remains strong but all new initiatives have failed and resulted in many layoffs. Further, C suite is mainly old-school white males and not equipped to be the voice of a business anymore.
Being laid off without warning
The pay Customers could be irate sometimes
This company doesn't pay more then $15/hr to new techs, so a lot of them leave before the three week training is done because they get a better offer. The people that stay get terminated for silly reasons and without any warnings. This leads to many stores only having one or two people and those people don't know much because of the constant revolving door of employees. This leads to a stressful work environment because you are pressured to sell the Asurion Home+, quickly turn around repairs, answer phones, and handle the front. Often you are alone at a store for a day and you can't get anything done. The upper management will not pay more for staffing because they are focused on profitability. What they don't realize is that it is impossible to be profitable with two team members at each store. If we can't provide great service to customers by providing quick turnarounds and good pricing, people will stop using us for repairs.
Not enough career advancement. Lay off happened due to oversee hiring
Inconsistency with leaders and departments
Arrogant, Not good at anything but cell phone coverage. They believe the rest of the world is just like the cell phone business. Not particularly good at operations.
Absolutely horrible management, never constant from manager to manager with instructions regarding policy and procedures. Huge turn over rate . Stupid adjusters that screw everything up for the customer . Preventing them from successfully completing the insurance claim to repair or replace the damaged cell phone. No consenquences for them. But the customer service rep / claims expert is held accountable for it. We get the blame for the adjustors causing problems. Asurion also features Mobile Techs who are supposed to come to you to take care of the problem. Via repair or replace. All too often they don't keep the appointment with customers. They never call to tell them they will be late or are not coming. Again no consenquences to the mobile tech. But the claims expert is blamed for the customer being mad about the problem. They expect you to sell a home electronics insurance plan to EVERY s called eligible customer. They continually threaten the experts with termination if they don't reach the sales goals every single month. Every single eligible call. They refuse to provide appropriate training for the experts that need additional help. The overall atmosphere is extremely negative .
Stressful and never know what will be introduced tomorrow Do a lot and get payed less
You will need to have passion if you don’t it will be tough
Not enough pay for thr job
too many changes/ overworked and less pay. the raises are given once per year and its pennies on the dollar. a slap in the face with the high cost of living. Also, they are always changing things, like now in order to get your bonuses, your reship rate is now included which is rediculous because they have you on lite TS and tells you to not reach out to anyone just reship. now i guess the company is having to pay out too much money for reship so we are forced to meet these unrealistic metrics. Its like you have to sound like a robot and not have a heart to lie to the customers. the phones they send out to customers are trash. customer get the phone today and then the phone is overheating or doesn't work at all. It became too much and it went against all my moral beliefs. I just didn't feel right lying to the customer or having them do crazy trouble shooting steps that probably will not fix the issues with the customer phone. Management have no clue about what is really going on, weekly coaching meetings will be cancelled at any minute based on service levels and everyday, was a joke. always having to help out front line agents which for the most part works out of another country. Putting more work on the warranty department. calls come in so quick you hardly have time to swallow your own spit. and if you complain about something not being right, they start to act petty. the job itself and the company is toxic as heck. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone
Zoom calls that didn't even need to be emails. 2023 still having clowns as managers because they bring ""Company Energy"". Major push to cut employee hours on a phone calls notice. Poor money management is going to kill this company by 2030.
No sick time so if you call out sick you have to use your pto. They started making is message from home quick to some getting used to but I don't mind it and we have to now sell their warranty when messaging now. I don't like sales, I did it for over 20yrs so I was happy to be done with it but the goals are low so I don't mind so much, it's a new skill that you can add to your resume.
They have no way to fix any issues
They fire management pretty consistently.
My specific location had questionable management, a lot of blatant nepotism.

They have no way to fix any issues
all about the sales, customer service is not that important
They fire management pretty consistently.
Have pay docked when write ups occur PPX pay model Forced to push sales on ever customer that is eligible before ever addressing their issue Constant micromanagement of metrics Unrealistic expectations for sales Unable to move position if in write up for not being a good fit for current position Good management is very hot and miss- they will laugh and be nice to you like they care as they are planning to reprimand/write up/terminate in the same conversation Offer only 2 total weeks to improve whatever metric you are behind on even if that is not a possibility Withhold paycheck until equipment is returned after termination They base the pay examples out of the top performing employees instead of the majority of the employees
Constantly changing your job role without further compensation. Always making changes to “save” the company money but you never see any extra pay for those changes.
Customers are terrible. You learn loaded of technical stuff only to be a certified claim filer. They are constantly changing the bonus requirements to unattainable minimums and can be very nit-picky
Has turned from customer service to sale sale sale or be fired
-work hours can be lacking
-Lot's of down time depending on location.
When I applied, the role was advertised as a tech service job, but it wasn’t until after I was hired that I learned it’s all about sales. The management didn’t know what they were doing most of the time, and all the fuel burned to drive 120 miles to deliver one phone (not kidding) so that customers can get it same day is insane. People can wait. I don’t get it. You get paid the standard federal rate for mileage, but your wear out your car and contribute to waste culture and pollution. It’s NOT worth it.
No sick time. A lot of office politics.
Only issue is that they make a lot of changes.
None that I can think of!
they can do better with pay
Peers having to teach management because they dont know whats it like being on the phones with customers Graded based on average call time sucks When things get rough for management they become even harder on there team Back to back calls Mandatory OT PTO sucks you work 8hrs and only get 30 mins of PTO so it takes longer to take a vacation You may have to jump through hoops to get your LOA approved If you’re paying into your retirement account making sure what comes out of your checks matches with their system
Difficult when you have new hires that arent confident in their repair ability
Toxic workplace culture, practices are to remove employees that use their benefits. HR unhelpful with helping employees resolve medical familial concerns. Grieving etc..
Stressful handling so many calls with angry customers
Sales they didn’t used to have
There could be less emphasis on sales/signups for a customer service role. At times, it’s as if that’s all that matters to management. You could excel in every KPI but if you haven’t gotten a sale in the last 3 weeks you are on the chopping block.
Selling is the only thing you can focus on. 3 Layoffs in less than 12 months
Lots of executive shuffling instead of promoting. Most execs have no idea what goes on in the business while making massive business decisions. Kind of a crummy insurance company at its core.
no benefits no pto alot of partner issues
Company can move quickly so need to be ready for change.
The offer letter implied that the part-time position was eligible for health insurance and that I would work 25 hours per week. They delivered neither. I left a job with healthcare for this job because it was closer to my field of study, but I definitely would not have if I had known.
Has turned from customer service to sale sale sale or be fired
Bad morals, feigns caring about employees
-work hours can be lacking
they will smile in your face with dagger in hand. a lot of supes go against company policies, like don't rush a call, don't bug the customer, and soft sales only. I was literally hired for a soft sale position that all of a sudden changed once they saw how good my team was doing
How workload is managed along with training
Management is over worked and you’re basically a number. Little to no advancement options.
Pay raises are just a few cents yearly highest I ever got was 25 cents. Getting a promotion is nearly impossible regardless of furthering your education.
Every position in this company is a sales job. No work life balance. Taking leave is a nightmare. You will be ridiculed for being sick or having emergencies. Wage theft here is like no other. The interview is a lie. You will only get 2 paid holidays in a year. I think 5 holidays total. Managers get free reign of their location and district managers are pretty much there to make excuses and ignore problem’s unless it hurts their wallets. They will change your hours at anytime. There is no job security. You will randomly be let go. The expectation is to go above and beyond. Your job is the person above your jobs job. You will not be protected. You are expected to be the human body shield for management. This might be isolated to my store or district but it isn’t right and I can’t support this company on any level.
Disorganized structure Management does not support different opinions Frequently hold workforce reductions Pay is not competitive
I could write a novel. They do not care about you as a person. I don't care how good the offer is, you will thank me later for passing on the opportunity. You deserve better. Go to Reddit to form your own opinion.
Only issue is that they make a lot of changes.
If you work for any asurion corporate store or position be prepared to sell your soul to sales. Despite what they may say they aren't in the business of helping people it's about scamming people into an insurance program that by design doesn't work. Training was 3 weeks of sales 1 week of repairs when I started and they have made it shorter and shorter. Upper management called me out of lunch to help people do their jobs and got mad when I reiterated I was on lunch. I was almost written up for that but then I explained to my district manager I was on lunch and I will immediately go to hr if they try anything. i tried to work with hr on accommodations recommended by my doctors and actual management refused to listen. Employee feedback forms only get read if you say you will kill yourself! I love helping people but this is no way to do that
Poor Work-Life Balance, Management treats you like a number, and REPAIR TECHNICIANS are made to sell product (???)
None that I can think of!

You’ll only move up if you know people , not into very friendly
They focused too much on sales and less on helping people with there phones.
flexible pay can also suck
Selling home-plus or you get penalized, walk-in
Do more with less. Programs are not tested before going nation wide resulting in a mass hiring and then mass lay offs
Stressful handling so many calls with angry customers
Work-life-balance, unclear expectations, unclear on company fiscal performance, unfair performance evaluations. There are more cons that pros
Sales they didn’t used to have
There could be less emphasis on sales/signups for a customer service role. At times, it’s as if that’s all that matters to management. You could excel in every KPI but if you haven’t gotten a sale in the last 3 weeks you are on the chopping block.
no benefits no pto alot of partner issues
The job itself is fine, and if I only had to deal with Asurion directly I'd be happy. However, the partner company you end up working for will dictate everything and Asurion will always take their side ""for business needs"". I've seen multiple people get written up or fired because a manager of the partner company decided they had a problem with them. The employee handbook is also kept vague enough that they can interpret it as they please depending on what the partner company requests.
to many priorities to deliver well
Company can move quickly so need to be ready for change.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-Ohio-State-University-Reviews-E2923.htm,"good workplace because the university cares about mental health
a great place to work while you go to school on campus because of convenience and the ability to connect with other students if you're new. Managers were respectful and diligent, and scheduling could usually always fit your needs because there were so many students available to work. The type of work you did each shift rotated to give everyone a chance to do different things and be fair, but they'd take into consideration what you enjoy doing if you have a preference. You get food before/after your shift, being buffet style- this perk is pretty nice.
Faculty doing excellent work in their field good stipend considering the cost of living in Columbus
Benefits are great, tons of sick time, flexible/hybrid-remote work arrangements available, work/life balance, emphasis on employee health and wellness, generous bereavement leave (much more than most places offer). The sense of community is great. Great people to work with. Employee salaries are transparent and made available to everyone publicly.
Can schedule early hours in desk work for completion
Good benefits, great community, respect for work/life balance.
I always appreciated the freedom imparted by my professors, as a grad student juggling class, family and this assistantship - I was empowered to get my work done at my own pace and at my own time. Great Leadership!
Amazing! Fun place to work and grow. Great staff.

The access to OSU's benefits is pretty wonderful. As a GTA, I had full access to all the rec centers, tech, bus pass, DTix, etc. The Student Health Insurance is excellent, especially if I went to OSU doctors/dentists. Teaching isn't too hard, and it's a good way to gain experience.
PHD student, I do not need to pay the tuition.
work/life balance, flexibility, and pay.
Like many higher ed institutions, Ohio State has great benefits, is accessible to many different career fields and is generally a desirable place to work for its educational mission

Benefits, free school, nice group of people.
This is a very nice, chill and flexible job for students.
OSU provides all the normal things you can come to expect at a large research institution. Due to its size, nearly everything and anything an individual could want to do or be a part of is available. As a 50% GRA, your entire tuition is covered including various fees. You are a public employee and can contribute to the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System, but have the ability to opt-out if you would like. There's also a form of healthcare, that I do not personally use nor remember many details of but do remember that there is a subsidy paid by OSU to make it more affordable.
The flexibility was really nice to have, being able to prioritize classes and not worry about losing my job was reassuring.

Achieving a good work-life balance and being surrounded by positive individuals are important factors in living a fulfilling life. Additionally, having a satisfactory salary can contribute to overall contentment.
the work was pretty straightforward
It has great management and perks
Training available on systems used
","no money in academia but thats to be expected
Not too many cons, however the work gets repetitive and you have to stand long hours. There also aren't too many opportunities for growth, feedback, or creativity in the role since it's such an organized operation.
Majority straight male department Female faculty are mostly jaded and unengaged Overworked and underpaid Lack of care from the college / university DEI programs milk underrepresented students for extra work, burn them out, and ultimately cause them to leave Administrators of TA program are incompetent and rude old white men
Pay is lower compared to other universities, and it’s generally hard to get promoted unless you leave for a different position. Pathways to career growth are not well defined in some places. High work volumes depending on the unit which can make for a very stressful environment. Some units aren’t as bad. Lack of communication and guidance across the university causes a lot of frustration and roadblocks, especially surrounding the new financial system. In four years there have been three university presidents (no transparency for why the last one resigned, causing a lot of uncertainty and rumors). OSU gave everyone a winter recess for the last two years, then decided to cancel it going forward. Because it’s the state of Ohio, hourly staff are treated as a different tier of employees (classified civil service) per the state. Even if a CCS employee works 100% FTE, they get lower vacation accrual. There was a whole restructuring of career bands a year ago, resulting in many jobs converting to hourly CCS positions, especially administrative jobs. Participating in the OPERS retirement plan is good but makes it hard for some people to leave even if they’d like to, since you have to commit to many years of service. Parking on campus is expensive. Research funding keeps increasing but the current structure is having a hard time supporting it by not being able to retain talent. OSU can feel somewhat old-fashioned in some of it's practices. At the department level, there is a lot of politics.
Minimum wage pay for student work
Some areas lack opportunities for advancement. Network within the campus to advance.
Wish it paid lots more!
Pay your adjuncts better. Pay for their parking.
Location of tOSU is not comparable to NYC or Boston.
no bonuses very little time off for staff
None for me while I was there.

Low pay (could be higher)
Need to be fully devoted, if on fence do not apply
Graduate students are notoriously taken advantage of and underpaid.
The salary is too low.
absolutely no cons at all.
Pay and total compensation, particularly for staff, has not kept up with local and national competitors; additionally, the institution has grow too large resulting in many bureaucratic frustrations and inefficiencies; my own career has been limited by few opportunities for promotion and growth
Not paid to market value.
Limited on-site parking, complications of working at a Hospital. Shuttle service was well run.
Lots of politics...don't you dare not share in someone's views.
working in a student life position requires you to work far too many hours outside of the 9 to 5 for how insulting the pay is for positions that require masters degrees. Yearly 'raises' are about $0.25 and don't even cover inflation
Pay increases are marginal no matter how well you perform (2-3%), not to mention we had raise increase freezes for over a year during COVID and that was never made whole. In general, staff salaries are not at market rate. Faculty-staff relationships are toxic in some academic units. A lot of faculty mistreat or treat staff as lesser
Pay, it is hard to get an increase if you're in a mid-level job. It is difficult to get a pay increase even with a promotion. Not much room for growth in this position, in others around the university, yes.

-Very large place to work so it is hard to get to know people across campus
absolutely no cons at all.
Experience will depend from manager to manager
There is a limit on the amount of hours a student can work weekly.
Work could sometimes be draining
Job previously required a BS degree, after reclassification, only requires a HS Diploma. Pay rate well below industry average
I cannot say anything negative about working for my school or department.
Work Environment is not the best
consenting patients all day can become redundant and boring
Work spaces; lack of flexibility on WFH; pay

There is none as an employee
It sucks being low in seniority, but there's so much turnover it doesn't take long to build.
Low pay relative to industry positions
the salary is a little bit low
Pay is not the best.
-Very large place to work so it is hard to get to know people across campus
The benefits with opers is confusing.
The company has a very flat organizational structure.
Parking is expensive and limited. Short maternity leave and paid time off.
Pay and hours are cons
Low salaries High turnover Insufficient resources Chronic under-staffing Arrogant and sometimes demeaning leadership Limited ability to take advantage of tuition benefit due to unnecessary inflexibility of work hours, which drastically limits what courses you can enroll in
Staffing decisions, even in the face of a nursing shortage, are profit focused rather than people (patient & staff) focused. Union isn't allowed to strike, so true power is limited.
HR and senior leaders could be the worst group of humans I have ever met in my 25 yr career. There are so many layers of HR to get through it takes on average two months to even start a new job. Plus they implemented “career roadmap” which was supposed to improve salaries so we would be more competitive with other institutions. Now every new admin assistant or executive assistant who is hired has a lower salary than the previous posting. Senior leaders were so happy when most of the support staff was switched to salary because now they can email, text or call you 24/7 - because they believe since we are salary we should be available around the clock. Almost all managers show zero respect for their support staff. Even when bad manager behavior is reported through an anonymous hotline nothing is ever done. I’ve been here 20 years and have heard of horror stories from many staff members who report their managers. In all my time here. I’ve seen one manager fired. HR’s position is that the abused staff member will move on and there will be five other warm bodies to take their place. It’s easier to hire staff vs a manager or sr. leader
Not many cons at OSU
Difficult to work interdepartmentally and collaborate with the medical center
I don't really have any cons.
Poor pay and small annual increases
consenting patients all day can become redundant and boring
Work spaces; lack of flexibility on WFH; pay
Staff at this university are treated like chattel. They are expected to be highly educated, experienced, flexible, and resilient, but do not see the compensation that folks outside the university do. You have to pay to park on campus (between 50-100/month-probably more now). The campus is very siloed by college and expectations for staff vary by college and even by department within colleges. No matter how many hats you wear or how much you take on, you will never get ""promoted"" or get a pay increase above 3-4% per year (don't let anyone on this campus try to tell you there's an advising career ladder, it doesn't exist). Anything and everything gets dumped onto academic staff, especially advising staff. The university and the colleges are constantly asking for employee and student feedback and doing nothing with it. The university states that it values diversity, but does the bare minimum to support diverse faculty, staff, and students. HR doesn't value talent, nor do they care to retain the folks that do great work.
Low pay, faculty respect, hierarchy.
pay is not great because it's a university job.
The pay as a GRA is capped by the university across all departments and disciplines. Unfortunately, this amount of money typically means that one has to hold a second job off campus to live a stable life.
My location was often understaffed which made it impossible to be fired as they were so desperate for student workers. The turnover rate was quite high, in the four years I worked here, only one other human had worked there as long as I had. The administrative staff was always changing and people were constantly frustrated with the lack of resources such a large university was unwilling to provide. They refused to hire enough full time employees and during my time there, people often had to work late in order to fulfill orders for the cafe locations. Despite relying on students, they could not reliably take the bus to my location and either had to pay for an expensive parking pass to park in their one lot or hope that the bus was running and if it was running, they would have to spend an extended time waiting for the bus and then waiting on the bus for it to finally make it back to campus. I loved this job, but it was sad to see how little the school prioritized making sure its production kitchen for the entire university was running the best it could.
Outrageous parking, minimal raises,lack of training
- About minimum wage (but isn't even that much of a con) - Exam weeks can be stressful given the abundance of students in office hours
Hourly pay not as high as surrounding areas
-Relatively low pay compared to other internships outside of the university
The teaching schedule is linger than many other universities.
low salary location not good around
There are no cons working here
Salary depends mostly on the department you get to.
Can be dull and repetitive at times
Lots of time standing Many things to learn and remember Bosses can be difficult
Slow hiring process for onboarding
Time management is key for a healthy work life balance
Cold winters and large campus.
Not many people that care about the graduate assistants
Large organization and lots of moving parts
Could do with the availability to work more hours
Long and variable hours depending on lab
Outrageous parking, minimal raises,lack of training
- About minimum wage (but isn't even that much of a con) - Exam weeks can be stressful given the abundance of students in office hours
Low pay, Low mobility or opportunity for advancing, Promotions given by picking favorites instead of experience and qualifications
Somewhat poorly organized responsibilities and vague instruction
Extremely low pay, low vacation accrual. Leaders disconnected . This company is too top heavy. Never money for the workers, because they have do many levels of management. The board makes all the decisions, but we pay hundreds of managers hundreds of thousands.
Not ideal for growing ""beyond.""
Parking fees and hard to move up in this profession
Incident reports can take hours, residents do not always appreciate everything you do
Not anything specific to mention
Professors are inconsistent with adherence to grading guidelines.
For retirement benefit, if you choose 401k type of plan, you basically are subsidizing the pension plan.
parking is horrendous minimum annual pay increase pay ranges for the same job too broad
At times, I may face challenges in completing my job due to difficult and complex circumstances.
not many people to help during covid
The hours could be tricky
Pay not competitive in current market

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UPMC-Reviews-E14679.htm,"The hours, no weekends, no holidays. Can cash in PTO, affordable health benefits, good retirement package. Great management. Rural setting yet top notch healthcare.
Recently improved career ladder for PCTs
Where I was located, I had my own office and it was a nice big area for patients feel comfortable I was away from the other staff, didn’t have to hear them, i.e. gossiping, arguing, love lives etc. I was allowed to decorate the way I wanted, I made it feel relaxing and welcoming for patients
Great job with a lot of potential for those who truly want to make a difference. However, one can’t work effectively within the toxic culture fostered by bad apple employees and the management who fails to pull the weed out by its roots.
Most patients were relaxed and not too complicated to deal with.
Nursing is fulfilling. UPMC offers good sign-on and compensation initially.
In my most recent experience, my direct supervisor is awesome. She has been very supportive and accommodating. She is very approachable, and down to earth with her approach to the job. she enables me to feel very comfortable and relaxed while at work. We still get the job done without it feeling a ton of pressure. She has shielded us from the heaviness of the job itself.

I have nothing good to say, DO BETTER.
I enjoyed helping people but compensation from the company was terrible and UPMC as a whole is a horrible organization to work for.

Solid long term company, lovely Superviser,
There is a lot of stability in healthcare so this job is not going anywhere.

In academica/research, the PI makes or breaks experiences. Fortunately, I have a PI who works to create a good lab environment and has always been very understanding. Pretty good health insurance
Not sure what that could be.
Wonderful hospital good place to work
Individual manager and colleagues were wonderful. Health insurance was good.
-Working from home full time. -Great variety of voluntary benefits (AFLAC is AWESOME! I purchased the indemnity and STD coverage and it has come in handy) -different pay grades pay different benefit prices, which is nice for those of us who aren't higher up. -EAP has been helpful - pension plan and 401K is decent. - if you have a disability, work partners helps protect your job and are very underatanding. Management in my dept has always been very empathetic to my disability and needs -my health at work. Super great, no copay for sick visit at work if you have an office. - cheap copay for virtual sick care as well - Leslie Davis seems to be doing a lot more than Jeff Romoff ever did. - lots of advancement within company once you get your foot in the door. - they added an HRA for employees at no cost to help cover out of pocket costs and it rolls over! It's been very helpful. - doing TAHS makes your deductible go down. It's as easy as yearly exams you get anyhow, plus a few extras.
Some good employees, have a strong unit

","I don't have any cons to type.
Pay ""raises"" through merit and performance are garbage and capped. Even if your boss feels they should more their hands are tied. Those choosing what we are making are choosing this number without experiencing/ witnessing our work ethic and skills. Makes zero sense
Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians I worked took care of our office patients plus the office below us I was the only phlebotomist so patients had long wait times when I was extra busy, lots of complications. Management didn’t like my bold approach to the docs and residences, I can’t help it the continuously put the orders in wrong and I have to keep correcting them over and over
Some places have a great culture and staff who are friendly and professional, as well as management that take care of their employees. Other places (Cole Place in Coudersport) have remarkably toxic work cultures, which are maintained by the way management treats the staff. Employees are threatened with the “do not hire” list should they in any way speak up or out about the way they are treated. CNAs are blamed for not working hard enough when the real issue is that the facility is short staffed, and hence CNAs who do reliably show up to work are doing the job of 2 people. This creates tremendous stress and burnout, an d the scapegoating culture blames the CNAs for the problem that the management created (treat your staff better and perhaps you’ll retain enough reliable help). The lowest level positions (CNAs) gossip incessantly about each other, creating needless drama that absolutely destroys the team atmosphere necessary to care for residents on the SNF. I stayed for only a month before resigning - a decision I did not make lightly. Toxic work environments damage one’s mental and physical health irreparably, and management needs to do a better job of identifying the bad apples so that the good ones stay around.
Had many patients and a hard caseload. I was a new CNA and did not understand I was not suppose to have 10+ patients at a time.
Hard to advocate for a good work life balance, because units have little to no say in the system. Nurses feel like just a number!
Mental health is typically the first place budget cuts are made when choices are made and being a new ""rehire"" I had hoped to be in my current position for an extended period of time; however our program is being discontinued and I will have to apply for and get hired at another site or position without a promise of a transfer as if I am being hired ""off the street"". I feel like since this is ""out of my control"" I should be given a better than average shot at whatever position I would be qualified.
- Pay is not great - No bonuses - Annual merit increases are minimal (although management makes it sound GREAT!) - Employees are expected to take on many projects, a lot of work, and perform at a very high level - Employees must work at a higher level than they're being paid and prove their capabilities before maybe being considered for a promotion - VERY political
The pay isn’t great Higher ups come in once a month or so to see If we need anything and how things are going but they don’t usually do anything about it
The epitome of the corporate medical model with focus only on productivity, capturing money from insurance companies for quality measures, questionable and secretive salary structure, poor wages, poor management
No room for growth, large caseload
Short staffed (its a feature, not a bug) Incentivizing the wrong work Poor management in some areas HR is wildly ineffective Low pay (UPMC is finally realizing they need to catch up for front line, but everyone else is still underpaid)
Transparency is lacking. Asking nurses to do more with less.
UPMC does not give letters of recommendation for future jobs and is difficult for possible employers to get in touch with
-understaffed -micromanaging from high rank and low rank employees -4 cent raises -overworked and underpaid paid -they make more money off of employees
UPMC as a whole is not somewhere I want to work again.
Medicare team is given way too much on their plate (tech support, billing, pharmacy, enrollment, dental, authorizations, grievances, etc). Other teams are not overloaded like this. We get 15 minutes of updates that get crammed in. No time to review information provided cause phones ring or your on auto generated outbound calls. Too many drop down options for note categories. Some times you have to enter over 5 categories each with its own note. Resource Unit is designed to help teammates with issues they can’t resolve but not everyone is helpful or knowledgeable. Sometimes you get different answers to one question. Others feel annoyed and don’t want to speak to member. During peak season your over worked and exhausted. Most people’s goal is to transfer once they made it a year…if they make it a year
They really only care about their bottom dollar. They can make it all sound good for the employees and patients, but in the end it's all about the money.
Everything sucks this place sucks
Upper Management ""Office management"" had their favorites. It felt like high school. behind the scenes.
UPMC as a whole is not somewhere I want to work again.
UPMC and Pitt both are nightmare bureaucracies that sometimes make it very difficult to do your job. No potential for upward career growth for scientists who are not on the faculty track. UPMC wage is better than Pitt wage but with housing price changes, the wages do not cover half of the cost of living for a dual income couple with a child in a reasonable neighborhood of Pittsburgh - people take this job for love of research and/or excellent health care.
No room for advancement if you’re not a nurse. Social workers are underpaid and under utilized. People with undergrads make more money than masters level licensed social workers.
pay scale is to low
Lots of micro management but it’s ok

Decent pay, overtime. short staff
Scheduling can be chaotic and needs more organization
Chaotic Overworked and underpaid Unappreciated
It’s a far commute to Oakland from Cranberry Twp when you factor in off-site parking, which requires taking a shuttle and paying monthly.
No advancement opportunity within the company.
Work life balance is not the greatest
Your PTO is accumulated over time, but it gets better after 3 years.
Lots of HR. Lots of rules. Almost impossible to fire anyone.
Abysmal salary, expectation that you'll see more patients than you were told, expect absolutely bare minimum barebones training, expected to work overtime and not get paid for it
If you work in the Finance and Accounting Sectors of UPMC and are not an FMR you will get ZERO opportunities. Expect to be passed over for someone with little to no technical skills or knowledge in your field as they have the FMR title and you don't. In general, the FMR program creates an unnecessary level of toxicity to an already toxic company. It merely churns out subpar micromanagers who don't have the necessary skills to succeed and will take all the credit for your work. Additionally, pay is a complete joke for your job title. Expect to be paid far below even the horrendous market standards. Raises are a complete joke, and they will look for any way to give you a hit on your review to give you the lowest raise possible. In my time there, I saw managers treat employees like actual garbage, micromanaging their emails and every move in such a hostile and toxic way that it negatively impacted the team's morale as well as mental health.
Industry lagging compensation, unrealistic expectations for that pathetic compensations, toxic culture, and a healthcare system that has a monopoly on care and insurance with no incentive to actually care for patients.
Learning environment not conducive to most learning types

I’m general, do you what you need to do to get some experience and get out. There’s a lot of favoritism. The schedules are horrendous along with the attitudes. It’s a depressing work environment.
The pay is not competitive.
Very hard to promote outside of steps for concierge. No control of schedule. Program director and manager tone deaf
Limited room for upward mobility once you are assigned to a certain pay bracket
high demand, stressful, unsure future path
Mostly telehealth Union Pay cuts Staff leaving No incentives Hardly ever any pay increases Pay caps out at 35$ an hour
Pay, management, benefits, no personal life, more and more responsibility and little pay
There were some opportunities during the acquisition.
The management and problem solving lacks
Health insurance for employees could pay more for employees and the pay could be a little higher
No issues were found with UPMC
Pay is a low compared to other companies e.g. tech companies. Growth can be slow depending on the manager
no cons at this time
No decent raise Micromanaged You are just another number

Long hours all year log
Pay could be better and more comparable
Very hard to promote outside of steps for concierge. No control of schedule. Program director and manager tone deaf
Not so great pay, being a big company you become a number really, not so great compensation for the 24/7 on call
Call center environment leaves little flexibility with scheduling.
Limited room for upward mobility once you are assigned to a certain pay bracket
They only hire people they like or don't want to have to find a replacement for. Low pay across the board.
Most things. You are underpaid, hard work is not recognized or rewarded and there is no room for growth or development.
Work life balance is not how fair the company claims it is
Pay & PTO could be better
Racism. Out right discrimination by peers and others. When you report to HR you become the target.
Accrue PTO can be challenging
Incredibly low pay for the work required. I quit to work in a restaurant part time and made more.
-The health insurance has gone up a lot. The copays are rough, especially the ER copay. - the pay... You get a review yearly and it's always under 50 cents. Leslie Davis did give us non clinical employees a bonus (it was taxed which sucks) but they will sometimes adjust your pay due to national average, but I got a few pennies. Kind of a slap in the face. Hasn't alleviated any inflation. - work partners is great but they are short staffed a lot and people take a long time to answer questions. - talking to IT does nothing. It takes forever to get help, if at all. I think they have a high turnover rate. - we had great vision one year, but they claimed people complained about it being ""too generous"" and they got rid of it. What the heck?
Lack of employee parking Lack of positive culture High turnover of employees, a lot of students
wages could be more competitive
Work wknds, work nights, short staffed
Lower pay doesn't value employees
High turnover rate, company seems to undervalue staff, staff feels like they’re expendable.
Just a number, not listened to, APPs are looked at as people to only serve the physicians rather than an autonomous provider
Caseloads are approximately 75 or more participants
Under paid, expensive parking etc
Upper Level Management wasn't the best
Off-site parking requires 7-8 minutes of walking in to work. Facility is outdated in some parts of the hospital, could use some some upgrade.
- lunch break is only 20 minutes -you have to clock out for lunch
In my area in particular, coworkers regularly say bigoted things including but not limited to racism, ableism, and transphobia. Poor work performance is sometimes ignored and sometimes highlighted depending on your relationship with your colleagues and higher ups.
They don’t value you. They don’t stand by you when you can prove malice. No one actually cares about you just do your job and even then you are replaceable. Pay is lousy and don’t expect them to be competitive with other companies on pay.
Not very sure on that
Poor leadership Poor compensation - fear of paying at it above market in most areas which creates self-inflicted wounds of not being able to attract or retain top talent. Too many initiatives and not enough staff, specifically with administrative work. UPMC will burn you out!
Upper management is absolutely ridiculous with their demands. I was asked to do a home visit when there was a blizzard warning.
Low Salary and No Equality
short staffed, rotating day and night shifts
Long hours all year log
Need more incentives for employee bonuses or cost of living increases.
Pay could be better and more comparable
Bullying, bad management, low pay
Not so great pay, being a big company you become a number really, not so great compensation for the 24/7 on call

Schedule is not very flexible
I have no cons. Everything was great
Management is horrible. No type of professionalism
Schedule can be difficult to control
Schedule is not very flexible
The amount of work we were putting in didn’t match to how much we were getting paid
Not concerned about employees well being. Didn’t care about hours you stated unavailable to work. Hours would randomly be cut and employees would be sent home to stay in budget.
Air often broke and was often not fixed for weeks at a time, and often covering shifts due to them hiring almost anyone
I honestly don’t have any cons. Run
it was okay time to be honest
I have no cons. Everything was great
management plays favoritism and so does HR
They were mean to me
Your experience will depend on which store you work at. I worked at 2 stores that were fantastic and 1 that was not so great. The not so great one was in the Chicago area, but the other two were in Virginia.
Minimum wage position back when I was employed there (2007-2009 timeframe)
Not enough hours for working
No advancement and appears unstable
Bad management, put 2 weeks in and they wanted me to work longer and I refused so they marked me fired and ineligible for rehire
shut down years ago, sadly glass door forces at least one post and I don't have another job to post.
Pay was minimum Horrible around holidaya
The faxr that it went out of business pour one out fr fr
Some days were not that new
Not being able to cover shifts

What isn't there to be annoyed with this company over
none, I really enjoyed working here
management consistently made poor decisions.
Un organized Bad mangers Toxic
The pay rate was horrible
no room to grow; no pay increases; unnecessarily stressful
Not good because now closed
Candles smell great in aisles
No payroll heavy work load.
The pay wasn't that great. They also had difficulties with scheduling. Then expected people, especially part-time workers, to be there for whenever someone called out sick.
Terrible pay. District management was a nightmare.
Hard to deal with customers.

The Pay is not the greatest and definitely could be improved.
the manager watched everyone like a hawk for no reason.
Low pay, no benefits at the time
Unfair management. No room for advancement
We would get our minimum wage increased by our hours would get cut
Too little of pay there
kind boring but what else do u expect
It's usually located right above the train station so it can be unsafe. Sometimes management is due to favoritism.
No cons to the job
Pay, weekend work, company struggles
Sales were low so they closed.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Leidos-Reviews-E730545.htm,"Great salary and benefits. Minimal supervision from offsite supervisor. Enough meetings to have good colleague relationships. Flexible hours, some of it remote from anywhere. Fairly casual dress for working with children.
Great learning and growth potential with lots of internal mobility
Note that Leidos offices are quite federated. So experiences are heavily dependent on location. This review is for the Bethesda office doing physics-based work. Despite the cons, it's a good place to use as a stepping stone since you have exposure to a lot of different technologies. * The work is very interesting from a mathematical standpoint * The tech stack is modern, especially by DoD standards * Some teams are well-run with clear communication on deliveries to our DoD customer. Coworkers were generally very nice, interested in their work, and personable. * Upper management is nice and professional * It's refreshing to interact with the analysts at customer sites. They're professional, personable, and often come from different backgrounds. * The office is very accommodating and understanding of those who come from diverse backgrounds, in both the racial and social sense
Flexible schedule and work environment. OK benefits. Values automation and guides to help the team. Flexibility if you want to transfer to a similar group of work for switching things up.
Competitive pay salary. Can jump around to other jobs if the contract runs out. Job security. If you get a Security clearance, it will last at least 5 years, allowing you to apply for other government based jobs.
I always enjoyed my work from home status.
- Everyone at the Charlottesville location is very nice and did their best to help and support each other - Inclusive and supportive environment - Good work-life balance (can usually flex hours around appointments, childcare, etc) - Work is fairly easy - 13 days of PTO as first-year employee, increases slightly with time at company - 3 floating federal holidays annually on top of PTO
They company had a goal of work/life balance. As long it doesn’t get in the way of their needs, it’s not a problem.
My work environment had great management /leadership
Reliable employment Decent Benefits Good Pay
-Great teammates. -Flexible hours. -Help you with certifications, to further your career.
Only 40 hrs a week max, people are nice, great job security.
Great team of people to work with
Working on systems that are not common. Access to large budgets and unique systems provides experience that cannot be found elsewhere.
Flexible and growth potential if you stick with it.
Great company to work for.
Competitive pay Good CEO Flexible schedule
Pay is above average, corporate organization and structure is excellent. Very solid reporting and HR related systems in place, inclusivity is a focus.
It is chill and cushy
Great interaction with general public, real estate and industry with an extensive need for information or servicing
Company culture is inclusive which is a definite plus.
Great communication, benefits, advancement opportunities
The Pros and Cons that you experience at Leidos is entirely dependent on the team that you're on, the project, and the customer. With that being said I enjoyed the following pros: -Good Work Life Balance -Great People -Great Benefits
No micro-management from leadership which is nice.
- Flexible work-life balance - Plenty of upskilling resources and opportunities - Assistance in finding other opportunities internally
If you have a solid manger most of the bureaucratic nonsense is minimized. Good benefits. Competitive salary. Remote work.
Great learning experience for beginners and a good introduction to the corporate world.
Nice place to work. Wish it paid more
Manageable workload and government clearance
Flexibility at work. Young engineers
Pay was above average for area
Lots of different and interesting work. No shortage of things to get involved in. Company gives employees latitude to get the job done for the customer.
Relaxed environment Friendly coworkers Good benefits
Easy job, great people, lots of good skills to learn
Great benefit plans A lot of Remote roles.
No weekends, work from home at times
Supervisor's are very helpful and encourage people to strive for career development.
A diverse team of engineers, incredible managers, and a great work life balance makes Leidos the perfect place to work and maybe even retire.
Reasonable workload, and reasonable vacation policy.
Hybrid work environment; get to go out in the field to survey jobsites which helps break up office work lulls. Immediate exposure to cutting edge industry design principles and rich experience environments (Storm recovery work and large complex projects). Willing to train entry-level hires to a good degree of competency.
Good easy to work with.
Great leadership, competitive salary, great benefits
Good work environment Great benefits and payment
This particular job is at a customer site so there's almost no ""Leidos culture"". The job itself is rewarding if a bit tedious at times
Job options; growth potential; stable employment
Many interesting projects to work on.

","The only downside is they are kind of famous for technical problems on the company issued iPads and iPhones. However, this is a known issue and technical problems have never been held against me, or have slowed work during work hours, which are pretty flexible anyway. Some of the on-site staff are not exactly warm to this contractor position, but most are and I just steer clear of negative people. I do have a minor disability and the contractor site was not helpful accommodating me, but Leidos did try. That won’t affect most people.
None that I can list
* High turnover causes work to be shifted onto already stressed and overworked middle managers. If I recall correctly, in our office of around 30, ~5 people left within the span of a year. * Middle managers on certain teams can be toxic. I was, however, personally warned of these individuals by my coworkers when I joined * Code quality is below-average. One bug in a deliverable was a simple producer-consumer problem. * Career progression is unclear. Some teams didn't communicate their development plans and key deliverables, so one couldn't be proactive in choosing work to further the bottom-line. * The salary and benefits (insurance) are pretty terrible, and below market. I got a 20% pay bump by jumping ship. Other DoD contractors gave me similar salary estimates when interviewing.
In the utilities department, pay is smaller. Highly focused on numbers and not accounting for how lengthy or difficult jobs can be. Annual raises are 3%, even if you challenge the managers in a professional way. You would either have to bump up to a lead or supervisor role to see an impactful salary increase or throw your off-work life away. Decline offers where you get bounced around from group to group of possible, it is much harder to get proper annual raises this way. Also if you have a bachelor's degree that isn't Engineering specifically, you are considered an Engineering Technologist and will receive the same title and pay as if you had an Associates degree.
Your job is usually tied to a contract. Layoffs all the time. Working for the government is slow and they supply you with outdated used equipment. Because of Security clearances, you cannot take your proof of work with you or showcase your artwork to your public portfolio, even if you're an artist, like a graphic designer or 3D artist. Having a ""Black hole"" on your resume is a huge con, because new employers will want to see your work.
Lack of upper management engagement.
- Low salary & salary growth (up to 3% per year) - In-office or hybrid only - Opportunities for career growth are heavily dependent on major new project developments, which can be few and far in between - Little to no onboarding - Little to no mentorship - Benefits are not particularly great and can be hard to actually use - Only 7 federal holidays off annually - Social life in Charlottesville can become a bit of a bubble (could be a pro depending on your preference), as the residents are primarily college students or retired folks
Benefits could be better. Could offer sick time PTO instead of including it with annual leave. Force use of PTO on days they are closing the the office. Example the Friday after Thanksgiving. You are not given the option to work, but you have to take leave. Training could be better.
Not hybrid or remote work
Career Growth can be limited within your area
-Pay could be better in my opinion.
The rauses were below average for the area but I imagine that has changed
Long hours and not enough staff to complete task
Maintains large government contracts that are driven by process over product.
Business segments are separate and not as collaborative as they could be.
Need a year working for recruiting company before hired on.
Easily toxic work environment depending on the team, and nothing will ever be done about it
Benefits are average to good, PTO is below average and outpaced by similar companies.
Outdated tech, older people, no culture
No opportunity for advancement, if additional training is requested is denied with multiple excuses that only keep you stucked in the same position. Lacking insights what good customer servicing means. Being a sub contractor for HUD, means that managers and team leaders treat you as they see fit or their mood for the day
The company is behind in PTO. No allotted sick days (you have to use vacation time or WFH), and the PTO accrual leaves much to be desired.
Maybe could be a little more competitive with employee pay
This may have just been limited to my project, but I did not enjoy the following: -Comically large amounts of bureaucracy (I've been in government contracting before and this was the worst I've ever seen it) -Extremely little opportunities for actual software development. This really depends on your career goals, but if you're looking to grow and/or test your skills in programming and as a developer in any capacity, avoid projects that include supporting and maintaining end of life legacy software
Pay doesn’t reflect experience. Leadership has little to no involvement. Little to no way of career advancement
- Salaries may lag behind the market - Extremely service oriented, it does not try to build products meaning your career will be only secure in getting some poly level clearance working with some government agency.
Personal management. I used to love working around people in leidos, however since the pandemic seem like there is a general lack or comradery. I've experience passive aggressive behavior, lies, and manipulation at the hands of other employees, and in one case, a ""manager"". When a person request for items needed for a project one should not be met with hostility and resistance. Standardize on boarding to eliminate gate keeping by some developers whom want to retain an upper-hand on a project over other developers.
Pay is considered low for other companies offering the same positions.
Poor pay and okay benefits
lack of pay raise unless in higher position
Compensation not too good at power delivery service
Poor Supervisor , poor attentiveness to needs.
Contracts come and go, staff size balloons and shrinks quickly making it hard to scale operations. Company is not helpful in execution. Indirect staff are difficult to engage.
Work comes and goes Pay is below average Turn over rate is very high Raises are minimal Hard work isn’t rewarded
Lots of sitting around or having to do other people's job who simply arent doing their job
Does not meet industry standards on PTO Policy Needs improvement in Workplace balance Management needs improvement Compensation could use some work to be more competitive
Working in the call center at Leidos in the civil unit is very stressful and we do the job that no one else wants to do and get paid about 15 an hour. We take identity theft calls and fraud calls and we are constantly bombarded with calls from insane people, lawyers, auditors, innocent victims. Some of the calls are very detailed and complicated. We get paid like cashiers, but do the work of psychologists, detectives, police, counselor, grief counselors etc
There a jobs with the same roles that pay a lot more.
Tight on budget so not a lot of financial help like relocation.
Low pay, poor benefits, low retirement contribution.
Utility work can be on and off at times; managing billable hours while learning entry level engineering is tough to juggle especially when there are crunch periods and slow periods. At the time, remote work was a detriment to the learning process, although the flexibility and trust from management was solid.
None that I want to include
None that I can think of at this time
Not really any cons to note
Because we work at a customer site (which is a gov't site) it is blatantly obvious that we don't get the same time off as the rest of the building. IE they get all the gov't holidays and we really don't. I also keep hearing from more senior staff who worked for Lockheed before the contract changed hands how much better of an employer they were.
Employee ownership was better; going public changed the way employees were treated.
Can be stressful as there are a lot of challenges in R&D work.
Pay not good in this area.
Standard Pay for defense industry
Not much leadership. The work can be thankless at times. In many cases your career development is solely your responsibility and no one is looking after your best interest.
Sometimes it is a time crunch to get projects out. Metrics are tracked to insure you are making the company money pretty strictly
It's alot to learn and take on at once so be ready for a lot of things thrown at you
Administrative work you have to do at home for time keeping purposes is more than most gov contractors
Contact ended, worked many long hours late evenings. World be nice to have dinner more even work family life balance...

No negative comments for this particular role, as everyone was great.
The daily goals are too focused.
Rarely if any ladder climbing. There's a huge divide between corporate and the workforce. The workforce are just numbers. Minimum pay raises that don't keep up with inflation. Corporate blows money on. I've never known any of my peers to get a performance or any other type of bonus. But of course corporate people get all types of bonuses and blow money on expensive parties for themselves. So yeah typical corporate company. And and for the size of this company the healthcare is expensive. $1500 - $4000 deductibles. Thats the best to lowest plan.
contracting can be messy and its all about the customer.
High turn rate of employees and management. Pay is not competitive.
None I can think of
there is less of a focus on building team cohesion and morale
Toxic environment. Underpay. No support. Can't get their act together. They will MOVE you to a new team (whether you want to go or not), and you can't do anything about it. No safety for employees. No ability to be promoted. Raises are almost non-existent even if you reach all your goals. When you hire on, they will promise the moon and the stars, but after years, I've yet to see any promise fulfilled. As an employee, you are a nameless, faceless consumable to be used up as needed and discarded because there are plenty available to replace you. Beware and DO NOT work here.
It's alot to learn and take on at once so be ready for a lot of things thrown at you

The job description, tasks and purpose needs to be defined more specific. There are no guidelines or tasks designed for an MFLC and you can feel so out of place.
No sick leave, insurance is horrible, and pay is well below market value. Remote status with hire but was changed even with client fully remote. If you don’t have an immediate project (no built in overhead for slow times) you’re forced to take PTO or unpaid time off. Middle management’s only focus is to exploit employees—Jr/Mid level are constantly being given Sr/Management level tasks but they won’t hire at the needed level. Turnover is at an all time high (even if they won’t admit it). Insanely unstable teams and no communication or process planning by upper and middle management. No promotions, even after 3 years. Abysmal annual % raises.

No negative comments for this particular role, as everyone was great.
Work is pretty boring and uneventful, compensation and benefits are below average, really nothing spectacular. Very few opportunities for advancement.
No relocation assistance. Training/Orientation could be improved.
There are no promotion cycles. You just have to talk to your manager and hope they fight for you when you think it is time to be promoted. Leidos also does not do very good yearly raises. They only give their best engineers 5% raises....
Salaries can be lower depending on locality
Too much micromanagement and not enough leadership.
Continue to find new ways to cross connect staff in different parts of the business.
Do not expect to work up the ladder.
None that I can think of.
Not easy to get a pay raise
Lots of turnaround, people come and go
Not a place for accelerated development.
-Low salary -No way to get promoted -Poor management -Atmosphere of lies -Leidos values are not followed. Performance is measured on how popular you are with your supervisor.
Management sets very unrealistic goals for designers. You could meet them if things came together perfectly but that was rare. Something always goes wrong there. Our system never worked correctly which made getting the work done even harder. If something went wrong and was blocking you from working and you needed a manager then you may hear from one after 4 hours at best. If you go on vacation and don't work the full week you still better have a full week of work done (yes even if you return on a Friday. The design standards were always questionable because Management says they heard this or that but they could never be on the same page. It was a nightmare. They don't care at all about people. They work them to death until they fall over and then just hire someone else. I can say they didn't get the 2 weeks notice when I quit. They got the same day notice they deserved. I will be honest, it is not worth it for what they pay. Way to dysfunctional and toxic of an environment. The stress they cause in every aspect of work is unbelievable. Very unhappy team. The days are incredibly long and you feel so tired on Friday that you are still burned out on monday. No work-life balance. I dont know how I lived with this job for so long.
They hire on low salary.
Sometimes feels less personable. But they will support their employees when in need.
If you are a contractor it is likely that you will not be working on a Leidos job site. With that, you do feel a bit excluded from company events and other activities or meetings that arise.
Scif work, poor communication and leadership
All of the management/supervision is awful.
No complaints at the company
Salary doesnt mean salaried, must occur PTO before taking time off
Pay is below market value Pto could be better
Rarely if any ladder climbing. There's a huge divide between corporate and the workforce. The workforce are just numbers. Minimum pay raises that don't keep up with inflation. Corporate blows money on. I've never known any of my peers to get a performance or any other type of bonus. But of course corporate people get all types of bonuses and blow money on expensive parties for themselves. So yeah typical corporate company. And and for the size of this company the healthcare is expensive. $1500 - $4000 deductibles. Thats the best to lowest plan.
Not enough man power to support the mission at times.
contracting can be messy and its all about the customer.
High turn rate of employees and management. Pay is not competitive.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/University-of-Texas-at-Austin-Reviews-E133952.htm,"Great work environment, let me pick my hours, lots of career development.
Phenomenal Research, cares about students and equity
Each college, school, or unit sets it's own salaries, work from home policies, etc. So, there isn't really a trick to getting in. It is totally dependent on each place hiring. For example, the School of Law has different standards and budgets for hiring than say, College of Liberal Arts. Benefits are good (health insurance is fully covered) and it's often the kind of place where you clock out at 5 and get to enjoy your weekend. Of course, that depends on which part of the university you're working in. Generous amount of vacation time and holidays. Usually, you get December 24th through the first business day after January 1 off. That may not apply to custodial or dining employees though.
Working for UT Austin conveys a lot of benefits, such as a defined pension program (deferred compensation, effectively), generous leave policies, and decent insurance. There are also educational benefits some staff can take advantage of.
- The tuition reimbursement plus the hourly pay works out to be a decent job for a student - Comes with university healthcare which is much better than nothing - Workload for a FT (20 hour TA) is definitely manageable - Location is on campus, typically within minutes of classes, so no big commute issues
Great benefits, nice people, good work life balance, good professional development programs.
Flexible work schedule. Nice Employer. Accommodating of full time student status.
Working with people who are leading professionals in their craft.
Good benefits, awesome patients, fun work environment

There are very few admin jobs at UT Austin, and they can be okay. There is some support. If your job allows it and you're accepted, you can pay to go to school slowly. Inter-department transfers are possible.

The environment at UT is amazing - a lot of alumni choose to work at the school, and the sense of community is really nice. You also have the opportunity to work in an area that interests you, even if you aren't a practitioner (language, science, art, etc.) I'm still astonished that I had the opportunity to work with such interesting, dedicated people and feel very grateful for that.
Freedom and welcoming people everywhere
UT Austin has some serious donors, are great at acquiring funding, and will likely be a U.S. research leader in the next decade. Is attracting a lot of high quality talent. Grad student career support is excellent.

Low key, low stress, great part time job and great superiors
Best first job I could’ve had on campus
Friendly, committed staff that are passionate about helping students and appreciative of student employees. This part-time student job offers great flexibility and a positive work environment.
The chemistry graduate program is overall not stressful.
Work in the costume shop is very flexible and understanding.
- People are interested in my advancement - Great research opportunities - Good colleagues
Flexible and good job for students.
My supervisor was so good to me! She was so respectful of the fact that we were all busy students and was very flexible with our timing.
The benefit is good for graduate students.
Amazing manager and hard-working team
Amazing benefits and good team culture within my division.
You learn a lot more as a teachers assistant as you have to teach what you've mastered to other students
1. Good pay,c heap to attend
It was a good experience for undergrads
Get to work on a ton of different projects Supervisor was very helpful and gave good guidance Cool work environment
- flexible schedule - decent hours
Tight knit, friendly, understanding and supportive
Very friendly managers and staff, good pay for a part-time student job.
Low key, low stress, great part time job and great superiors
My HR representative was attentive to my needs.
Best first job I could’ve had on campus
Decent pay, nice health insurance but the quality of the work and actual number of hours per week depend highly on what professor you work for.
Depends heavily on the team that you work with. The university is very large with a lot of different departments!

","Not enough tasks, I think I could have learned more
No pressure to improve because students demand to attend this premier institution for in-state prices continues to be high. Accepts top 6% of each high school class in Texas. Well funded with oil reserves; UT system beats Harvard's endowment as #1 in the nation. However UT Austin is a highly federated institution that does not meet it's full potential due to lack of oversight and accountability, fractured tribal politics, and protectionism due to fear of losing pension. More time is spent talking and communicating than getting real administrative work done. Staff are treated as second tier citizens.
Pay is often low and usually not competitive. Parking is complicated and you are put onto a waitlist based on how long you've been there and the level of your position. Which means you may be walking a half mile in the Texas weather to get your office.
The downside of UT Austin is your experience will vary widely. UT is intentionally federated, which means each college, school, or unit defines their own internal processes and procedures; for example some staff in one department may be able to take advantage of work from home while staff in another will not be able to, because the local director forbids it. The culture is local and which unit you end up working for will have a big impact on your overall job satisfaction. As a state employee, your salary and holidays are largely defined by the state legislature, and Texas is not a state friendly to the civil servant. A consequence of this is compensation lags other area businesses. Furthermore, while there is a pension program, it is of highest value to those who start young and stay for decades; employees who are looking to explore various career opportunities at multiple companies will find the package lacking in value.
- Depending on the class you TA for the professors or job responsibilities can be a hit or miss - Undergraduate TAs do not get close in terms of compensation so the job is less attractive to them
Salary is low for the area.
Not the most livable wage for Austin, Texas.
Balancing work and school is difficult sometimes.
Parking is awful and you have to pay if you can't find free parking
Not many cons, except the lack of bonus structure and career mobility. Those would've been great.
-Favoritism - Challenging at times - n/a
The hours sprawl and the pay is a little on the low side considering how much the cost of housing has gone up in Austin.
Austin living cost has increased while the salary increment is less than that
No growth possible, of course. The pay could be better but it is not bad.
Low wages for students and hard to get work hours in when students aren't on campus; when they are, the schedule can be overwhelming.
nothing is not good at all
The pay is not that great.
- Compensation was not competitive - Raises were small and not guaranteed - Tons of red tape due to its public institution status - No 401k - Parking sucked - Getting to campus, even your work station, requires some planning - The mandate to work on campus wasn't great, I left for a remote position
They’re remote averse even though my position could be 100% remote. Pay is very low for Austin. Yearly increases are small- less than 3%. They load you up on work. Three people should be doing my job- not just me.
The pay has become a con I cannot overlook anymore. The great benefits don’t mean much, when you can go elsewhere and make 20-30k elsewhere for the same job. Little room for advancement if you do not have a doctorate. It feels very much like a caste system at UT. I’d be willing to put up with more, if I was paid a living wage, but as it stands my salary barely covers my mortgage. If I weren’t married I’d qualify for government assistance. Also, you are paid by job title. The ceiling for my position is around 50k. Unless you change jobs, don’t expect to make more. Although my job title is project coordinator I work far more in the capacity of a project manger, but will never get paid as such. Only way to advance here is to change departments or leave UT completely. Not a very sustainable model if looking to retain dedicated and passionate employees.
In my experience, this is not an inclusive environment for African Americans to advance their career while having a sense of belongingness.
The hours sprawl and the pay is a little on the low side considering how much the cost of housing has gone up in Austin.
Slow to accept change. Everyone is always overworked and exhausted.
No room to grow, very poor salary given the level of work
It's just an odd environment as it's a state school that acts like a private corporation. Lots of private donors, all departments are siloed, the Gov and state legislature get way more involved than they should be. It's preferred that candidates assimilate into the burnt orange football culture and not stand out. Every staff, faculty member, and student must pay to park. And they kick you out of certain parking garages during football events. Some people retire and keep their garage parking benefits. This and the commute can take the fun right out of any job.

Pay was not great and how well you are supervised can depend on the lab you're working with.

13$/hr, no more free pizzas :(, jay hartzell
No thought required for work here
Academia is toxic and they severely underpay people who are not tenured.
Where do I start. I dont get bathroom breaks or water breaks and certainly don't get meal breaks.
salary is not so high
Grad students have poor benefits and pay, grant funded positions tend to pay relatively low and don't have much upward mobility
Downtown issues that most normal urban environments have
pay could be better in the beginning
Not paid very well compared to other departments
Almost too quiet, not sure if you're able to listen to music
Terrible pay for the experience required
Less pay than the private sector
Expensive city and huge pupulation
At least initially, administrative staff are paid far below the market value. This may improve a little as you move up, but you will never make enough to live comfortably, especially if you're a single income person or family. The math just doesn't work. I left before 2019, but that's as far back as it allows you to select in the box - but I just checked a current listing for the same position and was shocked to see the pay rate is the same as it was when I was there. Austin has not been a particularly affordable to live since the 90s, but now it's very expensive. I would love to return to an environment like that, but frankly, I can't afford to work at UT. I don't know how they justify paying so little to the people who keep the place running. (And I don't know if they still do, but at that time, they charged employees quite a lot for a parking pass! What is that?!)
Hot weather in the summer
UT has a high tolerance for bullying and you should too if you work there. Ridiculously low salaries for city living. Career suffers from poor group management. Uncomfortable work environment (racism, sexism, classism). No meaningful career support for young PIs or postdocs.
In my opinion, there are none.
Salaries are lower than private industry.
I don't have any negative comments
Gets very busy during career fairs
No thought required for work here

- can't work over 10 hours per week
Low pay for graduate students.
Bureaucracy within the College of Liberal Arts system
* Some system environments are a bit outdated due to licensing issues. * Vislab tours happen at random times, so you have to learn to speak even when you feel anti-social. * Be ready to clean up regularly since people on tours can potentially leave footsteps on the floor and finger smudges on screens. * You must learn to work on projects in the lab, where there will undoubtedly be people in and out at all times. * You must learn that giving tours doesn't guarantee that the public will be engaged in what you are saying. That's okay.
The pay could be better.

a little boring but nothing bad to say
Can’t think of any cons! Really enjoyed my time
None. Communication/organization and training of student employees continues to significantly improve.
There are limited social event to gather students together.
No big cons at this job!
- Academic work load - Project requirements always come before research
Hours allowed to work changes based on semester.
The pay is not incredible
Salary cannot cover daily cost
Lower salary compared to other institutions
Not much flexibility or consideration for remote work, even when it makes sense to work remotely.
Grading times can sometimes be inconvenient as they can coincide with days you have exams.
2. Weather is Hot, summers are unbearable
The pay could be better for the amount of work you are doing
Designs limited to university brand guidelines
- lower pay than if self-tutoring
No answer for this question
Scheduling isn't always great but you get a good number of hours!
a little boring but nothing bad to say
No opportunities for growth or raises other than 2% cost of living. So much “politics” BS to deal with when trying to do the right and ethical thing.
Can’t think of any cons! Really enjoyed my time
Grad student in STEM departments got WAY better benefits than the humanities.
Can sometimes be a challenge to balance work with school.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Rocket-Companies-Reviews-E7856.htm,"There wasn’t a lot of money to be made but it was a good company. Great benefits, atmosphere and support system.
Great health and dental benefits. Very good PTO schedule (4 weeks first year, 5 weeks 1-5 years, 6 weeks 5-10, 7 weeks 10+). Lots of perk programs. Can be involved in interesting projects and new technologies. Support for trying things that might not work, with three one-week innovation periods at the end of each of the first three quarters of the year. Team members tend to be supportive and great to work with. There is a very strong DEI culture. And general work/life balance has been very good. Rarely overtime or grueling deadlines.
The legacy team members and leaders are some of the smartest people I've ever worked with The ""for more than profit"" rhetoric is good to hear Superb benefits Relaxed work environment overall

The culture is rich. The atmosphere is fun. Leadership is supportive. The benefits are unreal. Always awarded for your accomplishments financially and through recognition. You hear banking and likely assume it's boring until you step foot on the floor and throw on a headset. I'm not talking Wolf of Wall Street. Maybe more so Boiler Room, except folks are actually making a fortune - no gimmicks. Just hard work and determination. Everyone is here to help, and no one is willing to watch you fail. No man left behind mentality, and it's a beautiful thing to see every day.
Well, you're employed in the USA.

I like that we can move to different positions within the foc. Timing is a big part of that but you pay your dues and eventually can try something new.

I'm 61 years old and didn't think they would hire me (I've read lotsa of comments that 40-year-olds consider themselves old compared to their peers). I am grateful that they gave me a chance. They have a super upbeat, supportive culture. They are very clear on their policies. Thank you Rocket for hiring an older person.
None that come to mind.
Great place to work for. Fast paced. Very motivated employees. Tech Savvy - Technology upgrades to the latest and the greatest. Excellent ISIM’s - Corporate Culture!!
Amazing culture of meritocracy. People who are hungry for growth are noticed quickly and moved to the right places. You are given every opportunity to learn the right things from the right people. If you have good habits and take as many leads as you can, you'll make 12k/month in a bad year once you hit a stride.

Remote worker and perks are great
New workspaces, great benefits and culture.
There are good benefits and company culture
They will teach you everything you need for a successful career
Starter with rocket in 2019 during the low low rates. Training was exceptional, bonuses were amazing. As time progressed it got better, then it went down hill fast. As soon as rates increased they started thinning the herd. 42 loans a month! To reach bonus. About $500 or less per loan on average. Then rates increased and it tanked. Within one year numerous demotions, cuts in pay. Obtaining one loan month became challenging for many people. The work hours are horrendous and unhealthy. Work until you can't is the motto. Left the company since pay was basically minimum wage most months. Great company, if you can weather the storm and survive with little during the hard times, like most mortgage companies.

The culture here is amazing. I've never seen an employer care so much about their employees, and the sympathy/understanding from my immediate leadership is astounding. Even as a new employee I could feel 100% of their support for my personal wellbeing from day 1. They do honest business and take care of their clients, which is another great motivator to contribute the best you can at work. You can feel that you make a difference to individuals, communities, and the general public as a whole.
There’s opportunity to work a lot of hours but it’s a low salary. There is OT that’s paid out once a month with your commission check.
- Good work environment for employees. - Great diversity and inclusion. - Compensation oppurtunities are available.
Good benefits such as PTO and healthcare
Culture was good Location Office

Good benefits and work life balance.
Opportunity to make more than the vast majority of other professions. Also the team, it’s definitely not everyone or even the majority of people there but the few that matter you meet along the way help make it worth it.
Great environment with a healthy life/work balance for my position. You get weekends off and a reasonable amount of time off yearly. Compensation is great and growing in a team oriented environment is very fun and rewarding. I have made lifelong friends since I have come here. When the work gets challenging you are not alone and will always have assistance if you need it here. Buying a home while using rocket gets you very good discounts as well so there are some perks that you would certainly benefit from just being part of the team.
","Low commission, it could have been more bps instead of set pay per file.
Since Dan's stroke and the company going public, leadership is steering away from the ISMs culture to become just about the bottom line. Decisions were made this year and pushed through with no input or reason given other than ""because this is the decision senior leaders made"". Instead of supporting team members, it's becoming more"" coaching out"" than ""coaching up"". Leadership used to be a great Pro and fed into a great place to work, but not so much the last few years. With the poor mortgage market, I'm not confident if the calculated risk taking that moved the company forward won't give way to conservative ""keep the gears going"" mentality. Consistent feedback that salaries are below market in team member surveys. They are not poor based on my experiences, but yearly raises are miserly and fixed (generally 2.5% or 3.5% regardless of market or inflation conditions), and raises and promotions are hard to get with no negotiation on pay increases. So over time, salaries tend to lag the market.
Appalling lack of diversity among senior leadership for a Detroit business The pay is grossly below what is standard in tech The entire organization has lost the plot since Dan stepped away from the company and especially since they went public The ""perks"" when I first joined are completely gone and the company barely resembles what it used to be The company doesn't live the ISMs that attracted the best people to begin with Promotions remain elusive and there's no rhyme or reason to who receives them The company says good things, but rarely does good things outside of a few splashy things for clout
It takes a long time to learn about the mortgage industry.
Long hours, high demands, too many hours per day and week.
Vulnerable to market down-turn, management often does not communicate major changes in a way that helps their staff adjust or make hard decisions.
Rocket is selling you on a dream that isn't really attainable with the restrictions they put on you. They guilt you into giving up your personal life and work 90 hours a week with garbage leads.
Hours are long. Typical workdays are 10 hours, and maybe 4 hours total on the weekends. You get out what you put in around here. If you're putting in the effort, you're walking out handsomely rewarded. With that said, if you do not like always learning, you will hate this job. You are CONSTANTLY learning and growing in this role. It's amazing, but some folks may not find joy in growth.
Hours aren't even a thing, you will be there from 7am to 8pm most days, low pay for wayyyyy too many loans per month ( 22+ closeable loans will net you about 4-5k in commission) and if that isn't a HUGE red flag I don't know what is. Team environment, your personal production doesn't matter. If you smash sales goals month in and out, you will be coming in every Saturday or Sunday with your team because the ""team"" isn't on pace to reach the ""team"" goal. Do yourself a solid and pay for a couple state licenses for 1-2k and be a Broker working for yourself.
Tough market with interest rates means that there's a lot of cost saving measures being taken. Lots of change in the last few years which makes having a plan forward hazy. Lack of collaboration across verticals. Lots of historical bad blood between design, engineering and business. Lack of UX maturity and missing seat at the table means that the design org is still just seen as people that make things look pretty.
The compensation plan constantly changed. Long hours
Worked in excess of 40 hours a week to stay on track for monthly sales goal.
direction changes quickly very large complex bureaucracy entirely non-technical leadership structure
They are grossly overpriced. They don't offer anything extraordinary from other lending companies. They force very very long hours on their employees due to the nature of their business and they select who they choose to enforce their non-compete agreements upon. Sexual Harassments and hostile work environments are rampant at this place. I've witnessed senior leadership partake in the use of illegal drugs with team members. They pay their bankers HALF TIME when they work overtime. This is as ""big corporation"" as it gets - they care about nothing but their bottom dollar and protecting their picturesque perfect image to the public. They are far from it - if you're looking for a place to originate mortgages, look elsewhere. This is no home for a real loan officer. If you're new to the industry and wanting to get your feet wet - fine, but get out once you have a year or two of experience, be quiet about where you go and don't go to a broker shop that they have a personal vendetta against or you will end up in litigation over their egregious non-compete clause.
Do feel like a slight cog in the machine, but will happen at any big company.
Project management is absent on most projects, so the teams have to figure it out themselves. They are constantly reorganizing trying to align with the latest big business initiatives, and that's very stressful to the team members.
No work life balance. The directors expect ( every other weekend you'll work one day) you to work every weekend and it almost seems like they don't care about us but earning their commissions. Burn out is real. You'll do really well a few months to carry you the whole year but they will increase your lead flow the point that you are completely burnt out. At that point they put you in a low level lead pool and you'll be broke. So you can choose the company or self care.
- Changing culture since going public - Mortgage industry doing very poorly - Forcing people out with ""Optional buyouts"" - Constant reorganizations of teams can slow promotion process
-Chooses shareholders over team members -Enthusiasm from upper management is very staged -Lead distribution is extremely top heavy; clearly designed to maintain tenured bankers -One bad month puts you in the lead pool of recycled, disinterested, and recently denied applicants -Fired 1,000 bankers in one fiscal quarter -Pushing (in some instances, requiring) people who aren't performing to work extra hours and weekends, but with minimal change in the lead quality. While some would say ""the banker is weak for not being able to make more of the leads,"" and I'm sure there's some validity to that, it's nearly impossible to convert the leads who have been denied in the past few weeks or purchased their home less than 9 months ago. This place used to be amazing...I was so happy and proud to be a part of this organization, but ever since interest rates drastically increased, the culture has turned sour and the ""excitement"" passed down from above has been so outrageously fake. Management (meaning the people not in Cleveland) likes to poke fun at the people posting in the Reddit thread about everything going wrong with the organization, but there is SO much validity to what is said there. Several people have had to take a leave of absence because of the strain this company and industry have had on their mental health. I have yet to see someone return from that and succeed. With the upcoming financial decline on the horizon, it's almost certain that things across the board are going to get worse.
Mortgage Industry has highs and lows. I believe the company remains strong in the lows but it's something to consider if thinking of joining.
A lot has changed within the last few years.
Lots of vulnerability because of being in the mortgage industry
The culture is gone since the company went public - strategy is lacking in senior leadership - lots of red tape regarding execution - low wages - they over-hire to solve problems, then lay-off people when they realized they’ve over-hired, this is a chronic problem - working til 10p is rewarded despite work-life-balance initiatives - constant restructuring and reorganization
With mortgage rates, bonuses and pay raises are lower than usual.
No cons it just got pretty bad after pandemic
Position is dependent on the current market.
I think this position is best suited for someone who is single and career driven or starting at a time where mortgages are hot. Being married with two kids myself I don't think I have the runway to stay here much longer. I know there's incredible earning potential here if you hone your skills and put in the work but in this market there will be a long run time before you can likely start making good consistent money. I'd say expect at least 6 months-1yr of training and general dialing before becoming an intro banker and then expect 1 yr before you can make an income above $60k. There are people here earning above $200k but it takes ramp up time. Go in knowing you're going to have to work your tail off for little for a good while before tasting the fruits of your labor that's worth the amount of your labor.
Long hours of working it gets exhausting
Long hours when you start
Working alot of hours when slow
Lack of compassion for team members, few feedback opportunities, leaders have too much power to make major decisions that impact more than just their individual business areas.
Health insurance can be cheaper and 401k contributions can be higher
Long Hours with no set end time, Sometimes unrealistic goals to meet, Business ALWAYS outweighs your personal
I was not a fan of Jay Farner and what he brought to the table. Happy to see he has moved on.
The current (interim) CEO has a habit of speaking to people with no empathy or consideration, and doesn't seem to respect his people's time or humanity. Sometimes the ""Isms"" are weaponized to encourage less-than-sustainable working habits.
Little to no free time, work weekends every week. Zero work life balance. They recently started letting go all of the experiences and senior banking staff because they were paying them too much money, they are paid more per loan than untitled bankers. Old CEO drove the company and it’s stock into the grave.
Lot of meetings, evening & weekend working
What was once a strong culture is now quickly eroding that it is a public company. There are no opportunities for career growth based on merit and accomplishments but instead based on favoritism and bootlicking ability. There is also little difference between what junior, mid-level, and senior developers do.
The pay isn't the best if you're not a top performer in your role; you may have to shift teams multiple times within a year as the mortgage market shifts.
M1 macs are not provided.
Everything else. Company is declining fast.
productivity is measured the same among team members regardless of how many hours they do or don't work (ex: 40-60 hrs, grouped the same), consistently given high volume workload and being expected to work overtime to complete everything without any end year after year, pay was good but significantly reduced in 2022 with the market, although workload seemed to stay about the same (reason for resignation)
1. The specific tasks as a Communications Specialist are easy but the Algorithim favored a specific group of aprox. 6 or 7 out of aprox. 35 people. They would have significantly higher lead volume resulting in much higher success. Not one of us from the next production tier down were able to break into that group after 2 months. Ima guessing they got into that group by doing really well in the first couple of weeks of OJT. That favored status (more leads) once earned continued favoring them allowing them to stay in the top tier. The fact that not one of us knocking on the door of the top tier were able to break in was a source of frustration. Akin to being in a race but a rope is slowing your pace. There were days where I was top producer, that did not help my lead flow as the next day started. 2. At $18 an hour I was motivated to try and get as much OT as possible (for the time and a half pay scale). OT is competitive, not pushed on us. But when I did get it I ened up working way too much. Which was my choice. But if I was at $25 an hour I wouldn't have felt as complelled to work 7 days when I could.
10-12 hour days. 6-7 day work weeks. Leads suck. Cult atmosphere. If I had to hear ""Let's Goooooo!!"" one more time I might explode. Toxic environment. You're made to feel guilty if you don't work 6 days a week. Management lies constantly. No work - life balance. If you have a bad month you're put ""On opportunity letter"" which is a fancy way to say you will be fired next month.
Work can get hectic at times.. Does Balance out.
Being a purchase banker is demanding, but that is not lender-specific. This job effects your life in the same way that being self-employed would. Can't turn it off. My family hates it, but deals with it because we're on track to pay off our house in ~5 years.
Everything else, word 3, word 4, word 5
- No strategy from senior leadership; corporate goals are nebulous - Values tenure at Rocket more than anything else, which is short sighted`- creates a bit of an incestuous culture. Going public requires growth and new leadership not doing more of what you've done for 35 years. - Lack of appreciation and value for back office roles - values only production/banking roles and this comes from the CEO and other leaders because they were all MLOs previously - PTO is archaic and very controlling - Not a remote first or even true hybrid org. They are so stuck on supporting Dan's real estate investment in downtown Detroit and getting everyone downtown every day to spend their lunch money they are losing good people. Those who are remote are made to feel awkward and are waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Upper Management is always changing things.
- Frequent Layoffs - Low Intern Pay
Very low pay are made to be replaced you're just another number to them not an employee
would not recommend, burn out career
Lot of meetings, evening & weekend working
- no career progression - micro management List goes on
The pay isn't the best if you're not a top performer in your role; you may have to shift teams multiple times within a year as the mortgage market shifts.

No work life balance Not the work load that the recruiter had told me

Extremely long grueling hours, boys club, kool-aid
- Company is quick to cut employees loose without regard for their skill level or contributions - Company is currently in a financial free fall due to poor leadership decisions and inability to diversify - Work can be grueling
At times not enough emphasis on living the culture.
Bad market for mortgages. Otherwise great company.
Long hours. Very stressful. Unrealistic expectations
Work life balance is not the best
layoffs, mortgage industry, poor communication at times
I do not have any words
Not an employer for slackers. No matter the position you are held to a high standard to take pride in what you do and have respect for yourself and others.
Laid off after 3 years
Large company, slow moving, some oppertunities
We get a negative reputation from our sales/banking team. There's more to Rocket than the sales/banking group. Not everyone is cut out to be in a sales role, the expectation is set during the interview process that the banker role is demanding (especially in a turbulant market). If you're looking for a long-term career with opportunity for advancement, Rocket can be that for you. It's all about your mindset and drive to make it happen.
Re organization Access issues in work
Our job is being automated which means more of us are being laid off. They have us giving tips on how to make the thing replacing us better. They only care about the numbers we put out not the quality but quality is used against us. Leadership and TRS are not helpful and team members are not treated equally or fairly. We have six different audit teams and training is lack luster. Remote team members are being isolated and pushed out including those with work accommodations due to disabilities. The culture is toxic and there is a lot of racial bias going on. It’s known that the peopl of color are treated worse than our white counterparts and when it’s addressed we are retaliated against. Rocket Mortgage is NOT the best place to work. Our pay fluctuates every six months based on the amount of loans you write. Low loans equals demotion and pay cut. People of color or with a disability I would NOT work here. Everyone else the jobs are being automated so I wouldn’t waste my team here.
None that I can think of.
Hours worked, no freedom, decreased pay
Company has a high turnover.
No cons to talk about now
constant change in the business
Long hours No work life balance High pressure hard core sales think wolf of Wall Street style
Intense and can be stressful
Leadership is lacking and the good ones leave the company fast.
Pay is low by comparison to other companies
Long hours. Very stressful. Unrealistic expectations
Lead distribution makes it impossible to get to the top. antiquated work group approaches. Constant changes. Arrogant team leads.

The health insurance and 401k benefits aren't as good as other places I've been. I pay $330 a month for a high deductible plan for myself and family, where my previous employer had a similar plan for half as much. 401K isn't a percentage match but rather a 50% match of your contribution capped at $2500, which isn't as good as a percentage match for higher salaries.
You make commission when your loans close. You need to close loans to maintain employment.
- There are ""suggestions"" for work that are not just suggestions. There are weekends we are not schedualed to work but are required to by the hire ups. - The rehire process is a pain to go through. Even with years of experience you are required to go through at least 6 months of training and do not get to keep your title.
The industry plays a large role in company success
Hours were long Managers were hit and miss
Pay could be better but it's not terrible
Little product vision. Work isn't that exciting.
Constantly moving the bar. You’re new? Work your tail off to produce. You’re experienced and producing above your goals? The company needs you we’re making a push it’s all hands on deck. There’s a real boys club element to it. Almost an unspoken like oh I’m sorry I thought you were here to succeed. Just realize that even if you are exceeding expectations and on a rotating shift to work the weekend you’ll still end up with extra time during the week or extra Saturdays on the computer just to “help the company”.
When the market is slow, there may not be as much work to go around which can lead to internal changes and adjustments that sometime have to be made on the fly. These can include changes to compensation plans and also employment status. Only in extreme cases is this ever a true concern. Having been here for 10 years now, only prior to my arrival in 08-09 and recently after during the pandemic did anything really pose a threat to our business. Even still we have found and are still finding our way to be one of the best in the business.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Workday-Reviews-E197851.htm,"Everything you read about Workday as far as how they treat their employees are true. People Leaders ensure they are there to support you in your work and in your personal life. Workday has very smart and talented people, but they also have some of the most caring and compassionate people you will ever meet and work with.
Ability to pivot into different roles within the company (started as a QA with no technical background, now moving into software engineer role). Actively working as a company to solution based on internal employee feedback. Large world-wide company but still feel like my opinion/voice matter.
Fantastic pay, great benefits, opportunity to learn new skills with gigs and lots of wonderful people. I truly did enjoy most of my time at Workday.
Individuals still believe in the culture that was present when we joined. Time Off flexibility is still good at least in the teams I've been part of. Great healthcare benefits
- Most of the workmates, team leaders, organization leaders, and project leaders are excellent at their jobs and supportive of their fellow workmates and teammates. - Somewhat unlimited PTO. - Comprehensive benefits and mental health support options.
When I joined during Covid, culture was everything you have heard of. Very diverse company except for most senior leadership. Nice campus. Supportive.
Overall, it's a decent place and people still want Workday to be what is advertised. Generally, there is respect for individuals
IC's are great and try to uphold the remainder of the culture that used to exist here. Expect to work day to day with some really fantastic people.
Company and product is in a steady state, its needed by numerous paying clients with no real competitor.
They really care about their employees.
- Interesting Products to work on - Fast moving - Care for their employees
Great benefits & Great Workmates

They really do put employees first
Great culture, training, products, people and tools.
Great benefits and diversity efforts
Workday coworkers are all very out going and kind. They always have time to meet and rally behind our core values
Benefits are amazing, Insurance, Unlimited PTO
Never have I worked for a company that wants you to succeed and stay there as much as Workday. Everyone is friendly and ready to help you whenever you need it and the provided training sets you up for success
Good pay and benefits. Work experience is very good on some teams. Strong market share with HR in US.
As someone who is more laid back in nature, Workday provides a good fit for me. It's the type of company that allows me to dictate the way I work as long as the job gets done. In general, the workload is definitely more manageable in comparison to other roles in finance and consulting.
Feeling like employees are usually put first
Excellent software, excellent CEO leadership, growing and no signs of stopping, dominant in HR and growing in FIN space, happy customers, cares about employees, cares about diversity, asks for feedback
Workday can be a comfortable place to work if you're a follower.
The product is important and will always have a market
Great benefits and generally people who are always willing to help and share knowledge
Work can be very flexible, sometimes there are exciting projects, generally most people are good to work with
- decent autonomy and flexibility - cared about as and employee
Good perks decent wlb in most of the teams.
Great benefits, good people for the most part, helpful product
Excellent Leadership, Culture, Product and Technology
It's one of the best companies out there, with an emphasis on employees and employee well-being. Many great companies I know of do not treat their employees the same.
Depending on your org, you can rest and vest. Very chill and cushy since you have a ton of autonomy. Most people are cool, but quick to throw you under the bus if it means they can look good. Benefits package is solid, RSU, 401k match, office snacks,bonuses…
Smart people, doing great work, truly focused on the customer.

Managers are absolutely wonderful and there is a lovely culture at Workday. Most employees prioritize work life balance without bleeding into the quality of work. You do have to put in the work but when life takes unexpected turns, your workmates will always be there to support you. Great culture
great wlb. Everyone care about each other wellbeing.

Depending on where you are located determines if your role is a dream or nightmare. The most diverse offices are in NYC and HQ-CA. You feel the Workday value in those offices. While I was there marketing worked on great initiatives, and I learned a lot.
Work culture amongst Individual contributors
Great culture, great work life balance
Good pay, good marketing, good products.
I had a great experience working for this company as a contractor, and I was impressed by how they treated everyone equally, including contractors, while working with some of the most talented and friendly people I have ever met.
Good work life balance and opportunities to work on interesting problems

it was an alright experience
I love Workday. I love my manager and my clients. I have gotten very lucky with all the support and resources that our company offers. I like being in house. I have grown and learn so much. There are a plethora of opportunities and tons of guidance from upper management. Well paid role. Prioritize work life balance as well.
The team culture is amazing
Benefits/Perks, great brand, fun teams
People respect your time and life. Everyone works hard. Very little politics at the engineering level.
Amazing product and company outlook
Good culture and great environment.
I've been in 3 multinational tech companies, but i think Workday has the best company culture so far, at least in the Presales organization. The team is so supportive and helpful with each other. The presales leadership team also really care of their team member's development.
Benefits, flexibility, brand awareness, new CEO
Good culture and easy collaboration with peers
The benefits are very good. Great people to work with.
Main product team would be good, HCM, Finance
Too many to note here
The people you work with are great. Everyone is trying to work collaboratively in spite of the lay off climate. Coworkers are supportive and smart.
Employee centric, Lots of growth
Workday has a great culture, where employees can grow. 1. People are very smart and nice: I have never encountered a person who would not take the time to answer my questions. 2. Always evolving products, either with enhancements, or brand new features. 3. Excellent work-life balance.
Good Work place for work
Culture, collaboration, talented individuals, work life balance.

- Working with people that are cutting edge and innovative - The role challenges you to be your best - Benefits - They take great care of their customers, which makes for longevity in business relationships
Still some hard working engineers hanging on with the hopes of a culture turnaround. This company wouldn't last a day without them. Good people but in roles they shouldn't be in.
Company culture is very employee-centric. Lots of benefits, good pay, flexible work model. All of my coworkers have been really cool people to work with.
Good culture, great workmates to work with. Supportive environment. Lots of opportunities to learn and develop. Market base pay but with great benefits, all together makes the package attractive.
Life balance was amazing. Product dev was really slow, and Workday really emphasizes employee well-being. Beware XO ""app development"". Career stunting type of tech to learn.
Great people, excellent at what they do. Great management in my department.
company meetings are cool parties
","There are no cons that i have seen or experienced.
Lack of diversity. Customers have a lot of complaints about or growing products.
AWFUL middle managers. My Director was based in the UK and he was a complete joke. So arrogant and cocky. He came into the team and was just a tyrant within our organization and never provided actual constructive criticism. He brought in a few other employees from his last role and they all 3 were just on their own planet and acted so much more superior than everyone else. I never understood their attitudes just because they came from another enterprise company. My 2 direct people leaders, my other colleagues, other teammates within my organization were all fantastic, but this one director was just a joke. Shame that he is still there, but he is arrogant and that fits in with Workday leadership styles.
Lack of transparency and sense of company direction. We talk a good game but have lost our commitment to customer and instead are focusing on flashy sponsorships, company acquisitions, and developing large amounts of low-quality content to give the appearance of progress. Layoffs. We were told we wouldn't be laying off, then they said the layoffs would be limited, but we gave the laid off workers rules around what they could and could not say to give a flowery appearance while threatening the livelihoods of the talent we let go. Many job offers rescinded and forced to re-apply or kicked out due to the new back to office policy. Baseless 'return to office' requirements. Sheri is mandating new roles be located near offices significantly reducing talent pool. We have yet to see any real data supporting the claims for their decisions. Pay cuts disguised as updated compensation philosophy. Good ol' boy culture among Sr Management and above. The executive teams are very preppy and there is no defined path to leadership, only the in-crowd seems to get promoted.
- Non-competitive salaries. - Forcing a return-to-office schedule despite the data (strange for a data-reliant company.) - Mixed messaging of company strategies to employee populations leaves workmates in a strange middle-ground (inconsistent leadership messaging). - Employee feedback is rarely addressed with action (while it is collected, and perhaps acknowledged, the response is closer to 'I hear you' than it is to 'Let us work together to find a solution'.) - Unless you are near HQ (SF/CA), resources are not distributed equitably.
Something changed at Workday when Carl joined. The culture is noticeably declining—and fast. Many of us did not receive bonuses and merit increases this year with management making up excuses despite record profits. Layoffs (after the company lied to us) decimated morale. Return to office was sucking the life out of all of us. You didn’t pay us Apple and Google salaries to micromanage us 3 days a week? Internal mobility seems like it has stagnated and there have been whispers that management has been ordered to deny promotions.
* Understanding how to operate as a diverse workplace is largely lacking. Rather than updating our ""game"" and making new inclusive ways of working, people who have different backgrounds or approaches are seen as low performers and get pushed out. * Managers talk and gossip about employees entirely too much. It's unfair to the individual especially when they don't hear the feedback directly or given a chance to share their side. *Org leaders don't know what is going on with their teams. They are too busy helping sales or making the senior leaders happy with unhelpful processes to spend time on managing people. * Internal applications to other positions require current manager approval, which makes the process difficult. You are treated differently as soon as they know you're interested in something else. There can be micro-retaliations that are hard to prove, but you can feel it. When we apply outside of the company, no one knows. Why is it acceptable to require we share for internal?
Management is horrendous. No transparency, blame culture for shifting priorities, revolving door of middle management leaves churn for ICs to pickup the pieces. WLB is out the window. First it was talk to your team about return to office. Then it was this hybrid work model. Now its sit here from 9-5 3 days a week and we monitor that you do so. I can only imagine what it is like for folks with kids. It is not flexible at all. Stock incentive for total comp is out the window unless you work in PLS. New goal setting strategy for management is glorified micromanagement. Toxic politics lead to a revolving door of middle management without room for internal promotion. New CEO is a VC bro just milking every last drop of cash. DEI is out the window and it SHOWS at the leadership and team level.
As an induvial its incredibility difficult to be noticed and now in 2022, they had many layoffs.
In the effort to be engaged, they sometimes don't tell it like it is.
- None at this time
Salarys are low if you are long tenured
There is little opportunity for advancement and the wrong people are rewarded if they play the political game.
Lack of diversity in senior management across the business. Very small number of minority IC's within TA to include people leaders. People fear leveraging Peakon surveys for fear of retaliation from management. Many workmates feel they have no voice and it's best to hush up do your job and don't challenge. The process for recruiting minority talent across the board is really sad and slow. Most of the leaders received their roles from word a net work at Workday and NOT solely because they are the best qualified for the positions they have. Leadership, does not like the low numbers of minority/diverse talent and complain about it. When offered suggestions to do better and improve. Many leaders would argue with extreme tension/aggression but not willing to change their ways or processes. Workday places profit over it's employee's. A shame when Employee focus is claimed to be a core value. Many of my workmates lost their jobs right before the the super bowl 3% company wide. But we were able to invest millions in a ad most people I know didn't even see. Those funds could've kept my workmates employed a bit while longer.
We offer you an exciting opportunity in a global company. In our team, we are passionate about our work, but there is always also time for a good laughter! You will get the opportunity to learn and take responsibility on variety of aspects of service. We are developing our ways of working to serve our customers even better in the future so with us you won’t get bored!
No cons at the moment
none to be shared, this is a great experience
Its a boys and girls club, if your not in your out. That simple
Company is growing so fast it is hard to keep up with the hiring demand and some processes are not streamlined.
Constant changes to territories and account sets.
Had cliques that are too hard to crack through.
Workday struggles to adopt new technology and decisions fast. This leads to slow turn around time for features and tedious process in some things.
No growth opportunities. Very limited to Grow
The management waters are a little murky at times
Heavy emphasis on in-office attendance.
Despite my thoughts on company culture, I do think that it is changing with the recent changes in upper management. I see a shift towards more focus on profitability and impressing Wall Street. I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing, because those who are able to ""stick it out"" will be generously compensated. That being said this is way different from the company's culture of the past 10+ years, which understandably is polarizing for employees who have been with the company for a long time.
Constant change and poor communication in my organization
Presales is shrinking in its actual function in deals, sales teams are gigantic (3-4 reps, 3 presales, 1 services, 2 managers per deal), business is very corporate now, integrity within sales teams has slowly eroded
Leadership is resistant to real change or innovation, and plays a very wrote hand at managing the business. They also have an extremely liberal bias towards people management coupled with a cut throat mentality inherited from many ex Amazon leaders....a bit of doctor jeckle and Mr Hyde scenario at the extremes.
Extreme toxic culture exists. Some senior IT leadership that was brought over from Operations was a disaster. She had absolutely no idea about IT and destroyed morales, made bad decisions and got complete rockstars to leave (flee!) because of her own inefficiencies. As a result entire teams broke into shambles. The work of years destroyed in mere weeks. The biggest shock is that she is still there at Workday because of some big shot that ""knows"" her and has ensured that she can remain untouched even with absolutely no talent and so much destruction.
With the new leadership the company seems to be heading in a more 'corporate', less generous direction.
Some team/org cultures suck. Long hours, high stress, or lots of bureaucracy. It can be incredibly hard to get promoted despite good performance.
- corporate - after 5 years there i felt like i really out grew my role. particularly i thought i found the role got mundane
new leadership brought a lot of new rules thats anti employee friendly.
Leadership pushing return to office too hard, culture has declined in the last 6 years
Compared to other options in this SaaS domain, there aren't not many.
So far no cons I could think of.
Dysfunctional leadership. I’m talking middle managers and their directors- it’s like watching a bunch of kids make up goals just for the heck of it so they can say they’ve actually delivered on their OKRs. Base salary is low vs others in the tech space, no room to grow. They say they drink their own champagne but that’s not the case.. Honestly, WD has gotten way too big and is terrible at retaining top talent. It’s no wonder there was a mass exodus of high level people. Those still there are underpaid for their role, but hey, they’re chillin right?
There are no cons to discuss.
Salary could be better Culture is changing
None right now to think of

Supporting a team. Can vary how much the the enterprise AEs want to work with you.
If you can only work from home because of your family dynamic, Workday is not the place for you. There is no understanding or accommodations for working parents who have responsibilities for their children that makes going into the office very challenging from a work life balance and the ability to do you job during working hours. Expect to put in many hours in night making up for work that couldn’t get done because of your family schedule. Workday is making its employees pick their family obligations or a successful career at Workday. Both are not possible here.
We recently had Carl join our leadership team and everyone seems to live in fear for their jobs. Also, they claim they only laid off a small number of people. They are still laying off people that are top performers one by one quietly. It is very sad how this culture changed so quickly.
Low salary Too many middle managers
Hard to get cross functional work done as company grows and becomes more complex Lots of turnover in leadership
Mid-level management has deteriorated as the company has grown.
Depending on team may have to use proprietary language
Workday has its share of inept and toxic managers with significant tenure (blind eye is given to their behaviors). So your experience will be highly dependent on who you report to. As long as you report to one of the solid managers who show real leadership then you’re likely to have a great experience.
mandatory rto wlb going downhill
NA - I like everything about it.
-Sometimes workload is overwhelming -Salary could be more competitive
N/A do not have anything to share.
With the pandemic ending, the company is strong-arming most (for those to whom it applies) to be in the office at least 50% of the time. Which often means going in to the office just to swipe a badge, even if it's a day your coworkers aren't there. Seems like a bit of wasted energy to travel to the office just to say ""I'm in the office!""
During my time there, I did not see one person of color in a marketing leadership role, specifically Director and above. I can assure you at the VP level; there are no marketing leaders of color. People of color, especially women of color, are not safe, nor do they have psychological safety within the marketing team. Do you think I am lying... Read some employee reviews here spewing hate on Glassdoor with awful comments like ""wokeday"" talking about liberal lefts are taking over Workday. It's disgusting! On my direct team, I was the only person of color and was eventually pushed out of my role. My former manager was aggressive and was only in the role for one month before attempting to put me on a ""coaching plan."" Every day I was e-mailed and told what I was doing wrong. I told HR I felt psychologically unsafe, and I felt extremely anxious. I was harassed every day about nonsense i.e. an extra space between two words or a comma splice. It's not a surprise my manager was based in a smaller region where 90% of the office staff was white. The only person of color in that office was a sales assistant. If HR is willing to look at themselves and pull in marketing leaders (senior directors and above), they would see 90% white professionals with blonde hair and blue-eyes. While there, I attended Workday's intentional sales kick-off, and marketing held a breakout session. There were only five black/brown marketers internationally out of the group of 300 that attended. Lastly, if you are a person of color in marketing, you are not getting promoted. You will be considered next to last for any type of leadership opportunity.
A clear bias against women in engineering leadership roles Poor compensation compared to market. Poor health benefits
On the other side, MGMT has changed and culture is shifting
You’re an idiot. Everyone above you is smarter than you. You have nothing to contribute outside of what you are micromanaged to do. Stay in your lane or they will take away your lane.
The only downside was that FTE opportunities were limited to on-site work, so remote workers weren't able to be considered for full-time positions.
Less fun activities than it use to have but still not too bad
- Constant reorgs means lost knowledge shifts in priority - Failure to retain key players - Some managers are toxic, don't care about their employees - Tech stack is a decade old - The customer needs an engineer to just configure the app - Failure to recognize the product has a bad reputation with customers
Fun was a company value that died years ago. The company solely exists for profit, even at the expense of their employees. Pro Services teams, and rest of the company, are expected to work 24/7 and ALWAYS be available to drop what you're doing and make work a priority.
not the best experience ever
There are some characters that I really truly feel do not belong at the company - completely different culture than the rest of us. They lack ambition and work ethic. There are very very few of those people but they do impact project timelines and make projects just a little bit harder for everyone else. Still manageable. First time I have ever heard of Workday doing this but did lay off people with the current recession. Very few teams were impacted but it was unfortunate.
No Cons to think about
Workday has been promoting long time employees into senior leadership positions but it doesn’t appear that leadership training is being provided during those promotions. This has degraded the culture incredibly over the last few years. Senior leaders don’t know how to have difficult conversations and deem anyone who shares concerns as a problem employee and rather than engage them in meaningful conversation, they ignore them. It’s deeply concerning that this will drive all legacy employees and top performers away.
Very slow to promote from within.
Understanding changes from upper management
Less flexibility with working remote.
Some may think that Workday is too rigid in terms of engagement with customers and ask support of internal team.
I had a really bad experience at this company. In the short time I was there, 3 levels of leadership turned over. Leadership in the org I supported was all promoted from within and struggles with making even basic decisions. Everything moves very slowly and it’s difficult to drive any sort of internal innovation. I never experienced the workmate culture and instead it felt like a clique where people that had been there a long time or had been practitioners were not open to new people or ideas. I think bringing in the new CEO was a great idea and hopefully he can turn things around.
hard to move to higher level
The proprietary language is disgusting and it's not used anywhere outside. Waste of time, energy, and brain cells. Too heavy management, which adds overhead to the developers under them. Too much hierarchy in management, which is not needed nowadays. Should actually have a somewhat flat structure where everybody produces. People are smart enough to manage themselves and their work. Use your knowledge and skills in building something not to poke into and give suggestions of what to do.
Analytics UX has no good culture. manager and director has toxic relationship pursuing authority.
Work life balance difficult to manage
The software is proprietary so if you spend years devoted to Workday, and they decide to do layoffs so they can afford Superbowl ads and expensive, unnecessary real estate, they you will not be marketable to other companies. It's a big problem.
None that I can think of
Not sure if the base compensation is on par with other similar organizations. Although hybrid model is okay, I would prefer fully remote option.
none none none none none
NA - I like everything about it.
Recently, Workday has been having quiet layoffs. Unlike transparent companies that do not shy from publicizing layoffs, Workday is gutless and dishonorable accepting skill imbalance as the reason for termination. This was never brought up in years past, but suddenly it's in vogue? Workday's core values are Employees, Integrity, Innovation, Customer Service, Fun, and Profitability. How is this an example of any of their values? Core values mean nothing except to superficially attract talent and customers. Workday hypes its values, whereas internally, these are only empty ideas and perceptions. Affected employees were not extended a dignified layoff departure even after years of faithful, dedicated sacrifices for the company. Shame on you Workday. Out of all the impacted teams, one team in Payroll QA was impacted the most. Folks with strong performances were let go or transferred to other teams while other average performers were untouched. The Payroll QA Director stripped the soul from one Payroll team, and there is Twitter-like insecurity for current employees. How does this Director of Payroll QA continue to walk the office corridors when everybody is eyeing her with disgust and disdain? If you apply for QA positions at Workday, avoid Payroll to save your career.
-Sometimes workload is overwhelming -Salary could be more competitive
N/A do not have anything to share.
When I joined, I only knew my manager. What used to be great was an almost flat hierarchy where all team members came together to solve problems and the only person asking me for an update was my manager. Now even the Senior Director will reach you directly to ask you about something you worked on and so will everybody in between. The direct low level managers are hand puppets that the Director and above control. These were mostly developers or automators who failed at becoming good engineers OR just didn't like the technology but somehow managed to score in interviews OR pull the right strings to become people managers OR can thank Workday's diversity goals (true story!). All they do is look at dashboards, scoreboards and make sure no work goes unassigned. Primary reason for no career growth for aspiring engineers. Meetings have gotten awful with everyone trying to give their 2 cents and ultimately adding no real value to conversations. Every effort is to make yourself look good because if you are not valuable, you become an easy scapegoat or get pushed aside. Not a fun place anymore and now just a race to get ahead of the other instead of working towards common goals and delivering features that wow. We also have a new wave of product managers who really have no true sense of product ownership and need a lot of hand holding and reliance on engineers to get their work done.
With the pandemic ending, the company is strong-arming most (for those to whom it applies) to be in the office at least 50% of the time. Which often means going in to the office just to swipe a badge, even if it's a day your coworkers aren't there. Seems like a bit of wasted energy to travel to the office just to say ""I'm in the office!""
Complex environment and ALWAYS evolving, you can hardly understand the entire stack, long learning curve . Often the stuff you learn applies to Workday only, you can't use that knowledge eleswhere, In Workday you are expected to work hard! Which isn't a bad thing but can burn people out if not careful. The new hybrid working model isn't working for parents
Technologically, fairly behind. Only a handful of really amazing engineers. Most engineers are pretty average.
In my 8 years there I’ve seen the culture shift from customer first to sell first. Employees not considered as much with mandates like must be in an office 50% of the time and we’re tracking you. Very difficult to change jobs.
dictator/jerk bosses, horrible work environment

","Due to Business Alignment Strategy - Site was identified for divestment.
The past 3 years with WFH has been transformative to the organization, but for some reason, they are attempting to drag the company back into the 1980s like the internet doesn't exist. C-level and VP-level executives are obsessed with RTO at the SSF site, even for people that work in globally distributed teams. They have begun to count badge swipes to punish employees that don't comply to set an example. Yearly cost of living raises are not keeping up with inflation and most employees have lost somewhere in the range of 10-15% in spending power over the past 3 years. HR will claim that yearly cost of living raises are given to keep up with the cost of labor, but words like these don't pay for rent, food, or energy costs that are spiraling in the Bay Area. The lab scientists have seen massive budget cuts this year and are forced to scrounge and negotiate with all of their suppliers to have reagents, materials, and basic lab supplies to perform their experiments or risk missing their goals. DEI efforts are talked about like things are going great, but the newly formed gCS department leadership team was just filled entirely with middle-aged white men.
The expectation for metrics in unrealistic. They push metrics really hard. Definitely quantity over quality!
Career development opportunites are limited Bonuses are not what they used to be Salaries have not kept up very well with inflation Takes forever for IC's to get promoted, while folks in upper management are promoted every 5 years or so like clockwork Too bureaucratic at times wrt decision making
Lots of change and lacking investment in change management and bringing people along
Large company dynamics, not for everyone. This can be difficult to navigate. Wearing a lot of hats. Flat org can be challenging depending on your work experience and ability to adapt.
Sadly, some departments do not value their support staff as much as others. The bureaucracy and politics can hurt those employees who really love their job and give 150% every day. After thriving in a remote environment, culture, employee morale, and mental health suffered with the on-campus requirement, don't get me wrong, the campus is INCREDIBLE, but more remote options for those who cannot afford rising costs in the Bay Area would be appreciated.
Working from the office is required and inflexible.
decision making is slow reorg happening every 3-4 years
Look at the reviews for Tailored Management because that's who you'd be contracting for.
-More long-term career pathway options
I can't think anything for Cons
As part of a global organization, sometimes hard understand why some decisions are made
Basically everything related to culture. -Maybe you'll have a team outing twice a year if that, no sense of community within departments -One manager for a lot of employees so barely any time to discuss career opportunities, feels like very limited interaction with manager -Promotion structure is terrible if you're entry-mid level and only happens in infrequent cycles (once-twice a year max). So many hoops to jump through to get promoted, but they're more than happy to bring in external hires above you that you'll end up training. -Management is out of touch with their employees experience despite receiving feedback -High contractor turnover so always dealing with people ""getting up to speed""
Toxic culture, senior people taking advantage of juniors. Everybody knows and nobody does anything about it. A lot of politics. Monotonous job. Salaries should be more competitive.
Nothing major so far, may need clearer advice on career development path.
creating new opportunities can be difficult
The workload can be a lot. The pay is on the lower end when compared to other pharmaceuticals companies.
Promotions can be slow in some departments, particularly in technical or research fields
Slow Work processes at this company
hard to get full time opportunity
I do not have bad things to say
upper management turns a blind eye to what goes on in departments

Constant transformation and certain very poor leaders being promoted beyond their ability

Leadership unsure of site direction/ mixed signals Job feels like it has no direction/ goal Don't feel effort is valued or rewarded proportionally within MSAT organisation

I am a contracted employee, so we don't get the same benefits (healthcare, etc) as non-contracted
big company so hard to be promoted
slow career development for researcher track
Not a great deal of opportunity to be promoted
Company has utterly lost its way from a Commercial standpoint. Hierarchies and silos were demolished and new ones created with power concentrated in a failed design and lackluster implementation.
Limited growth opportunities with PhD.
None at the moment. Great company
Living under the Roche umbrella has arguably taken away Genentech’s unique innovation capabilities.
Getting more engrained in Roche business
Too large of a company leading to lots of red tape
Toxic environment. Enables slacking employess. Highly political.
Genentech talks about work/life balance. However, this is not consistent across the organization. It is dependent on your manager and having a good manager is few and far between. My time at Genentech was not positive from a manager perspective. But, I did hear stories about good managers at Genentech (but not many) and their fairness regarding work/life balance. Same goes for approval to attend conferences or training. All depends on whether or not your manager has your back.
To commute to South San Francisco is too long when you leave in the East Bay.
It was never decided to maximize profit or invest to improve the site of Vacaville.
Feels like you have to alter who you are to get promoted Big focus on what language/words you use Opportunities for growth Having to be on site more and more I dunno?
Company would benefit if senior management would reconsider their managerial style
leadership isnt tenured and they've lost their focus on employees.
-There are some supervisors that do not help their workers and just downgrade them all the time. -You will also get that one worker that complains about the simplest thing and not a team player. -Working graves can be extremely difficult with a 13 hour shift and you are worked to your bones.
Everything was positive here at the company.
I cannot think of any.
lack of a vision for introducing novel technologies and/or unifying informatics work
Extremely large company. Difficulty making large impact on big projects. Not too much room for creativity outside very competitive early research labs.
Senior management not onsite as often as some would like, but are almost often responsive.

Manufacturing management and politics are the worst. It’s best if you move out of manufacturing into more technical positions.

Nothing bad to report here.
difficult making a meaningful impact, hierarchy,
Bad things are staying bad year after year because the measure of success is just to have an idea , implement it and then shout it from roof tops to get that next promotion, No one follows up to see if the idea actually worked. Emphasis is on looking like you are doing something good rather than actually doing good. IT environment has remained a couple of decades behind , since emphasis is on doing things cheaper with no regard for the users who have to deal with the poor decision made in that arena by spending time doing workarounds. The phrase digital transformation is used a lot but in practice nothing much materializes and folks are still dependent on spreadsheets and macros. Bottom line current corporate culture is geared towards defending the status quo
Several to mention; Mgt dysfunction in Commercial
Unqualified personnel managing who were hired because of whom they know.
Leadership team clogging the pipeline and hardly moving making career progression very hard. Also a very flat organization.
Politics. Interview process feedback none. Not clear.
They are no longer top leaders in oncology and their drug pipeline sometimes struggle. Lots of meetings, though they are making them less mandatory and attendance is encouraged agenda-based.
Extremely large company. Difficulty making large impact on big projects. Not too much room for creativity outside very competitive early research labs.
Very slow promotion/advancement cycles Budget challenges
-Growth in SSF -IT Management is all in EMEA
No direct hire positions super long shifts
Typical office politics can be frustrating to deal with at times
average pay and some toxic teams
-extreme politics. Management heavy -leadership completely disconnected and out of touch with individual contributors, top down leadership approach. Lack of appreciation for employees. Saw one director cancel $200 awards sent to some senior employees for a grueling 1.5+ year project with non-stop 12+ hour work days sent by another leader as a thank you, because it ""didnt fit within their dept budget"". Dozens of other employees outside of that dept did receive their little award for putting in 1.5 FTE time for more than a year. Not even a verbal thank you or congratulations other than an email sent out to the large (~30 person) team. Project was on top of normal day to day responsibilities. -over proceduralized, very hard to get work done within expected timelines -most days now mandated on site, for many people this means 3-4+ hours of commuting each day unless you can want to move to the area, leadership tracking attendance with threats against performance reviews, even for employees who already work extremely long days at home. Knew of many employees commuting 5+ hours in a day without ample salary to live in the area. -leadership with no knowledge of work processes, bottlenecking, hurdles -non-existent resource management for project loading -extremely hard to influence change, lack of decision-making causing extra workload for individual contributors -significant waste on outlandish projects and fun items people dont need, instead of hiring enough employees to get the work done properly -not enough staff to support GMP facilities, often no backfilling for lost headcount
Takes time to grow at a small site
Cross functional/department collaboration needs attention
Upper management has gotten more and more detached from the company over the years and seems to be stuck in generic corporate culture. For years we were told that flexibility would be an important learning coming out of the pandemic, yet leadership bait and switched employees in September 2022. Prior to the pandemic, Genentech was a very forward looking and progressive company. Despite the company operating quite well during the pandemic now employees no matter their role must be on campus “the majority of the time”. It feels as though leadership may have forgotten that fundamental to our culture at Genentech is that we trust our employees. Going all the way back to Art Levinson haven’t had a command and control culture. We’re non hierarchical, we agree on a vision and those who work for Genentech come together to make it happen. I’m hopeful that upper management can figure it out before it’s too late, but I fear that the lack of trust that has now emerged between employees and upper management may hurt this great company. In addition, for several years there has been a big focus on cost cutting, largely due to biosimilar competition. While some of this was healthy there seems to be an overly optimistic view on outsourcing processes, particularly in the IT space to the lowest bidder. I don’t think that we can claim to be an innovative Bay Area company when our IT stack is from 1998 and maintained by consultants from India.
Huge company- despite efforts, feels very “corporate” at times
Not the best pay grade. Seasoned employees are payed the same as new employees, sometimes less.
Nepotism. They do not have a sales incentive in the role anymore so it’s hard to understand how they promote people to new roles
Bad things are staying bad year after year because the measure of success is just to have an idea , implement it and then shout it from roof tops to get that next promotion, No one follows up to see if the idea actually worked. Emphasis is on looking like you are doing something good rather than actually doing good. IT environment has remained a couple of decades behind , since emphasis is on doing things cheaper with no regard for the users who have to deal with the poor decision made in that arena by spending time doing workarounds. The phrase digital transformation is used a lot but in practice nothing much materializes and folks are still dependent on spreadsheets and macros. Bottom line current corporate culture is geared towards defending the status quo
Several to mention; Mgt dysfunction in Commercial
Many of the co workers are Aggressive coworkers
Unqualified personnel managing who were hired because of whom they know.
No career growth and limited opportunities
Leadership team clogging the pipeline and hardly moving making career progression very hard. Also a very flat organization.
Politics. Interview process feedback none. Not clear.
You sometimes are not guaranteed placement to the rotation you want
Typical down sides of a large company
Very slow promotion/advancement cycles Budget challenges
Although there are many development opportunities, depending on what role you have or what department you're in, you might not be able to take advantage of those opportunities. You are basically stuck wherever the business need is when it comes to rotations. Which is understandable but also a con.
Although senior management are great, not all middle management embody value based leadership. Some do the command and control type of leadership that’s why some people in the manufacturing floor are not too happy.
Nightshift workers often had the short end of the stick in regard to support, accommodations, and opportunity.
Constant transformation and many additional new working models and processes being implemented
High work load and work with mediocre providers
They take advantage of their workforce
Sometimes slow with layers of mgt
Hard to get hired on as a permeant position as a postdoc Work culture depends on departments and your manager's style
Technical roles don't pay quite as well.

You get to work most weekends and Holidays, even though they tell you these are days off and part of your benefits package
I enjoyed my time at Eaton. The people I worked with were top notch and work/life balance was very good.
Currently, there is no mandatory overtime, which is great for us salaried employees. Solid leadership team, and we get along great with our peers.

Stability, strong employees and fair pay
I loved Eaton as they were the first company to ever give me a chance in the HR field while I was still in my Master's program. It is a manufacturing, power management company so their locations are usually pretty remote or not the best, even the HQ is in Beachwood, OH. The pros are that they do take their HR seriously and the further you move up, the more strategic the work, but the entry level work is pretty grunt. It's just the day to day taking care of a facility kind of work and having to work alongside hourly employees and build a rapport with them so that they trust you and will come to you. The pay is middle of the pack, the benefits package is middle of the pack, their vacation is subpar (start with 2 weeks and after 5 years you get 3 weeks with the opportunity to also purchase a week of vacation by using your own money) and somewhat archaic. Company culture is very laid back but still very serious with its supply chain and the demands necessary for it.

","None really, good company to work for
Millennial leadership who got raised on participation awards who apparently never got challenged with the word NO. If you have a position that gets asked decision questions, if your answer is what they want to hear they're OK. If you give them a fact-based God's honest answer they don't want to hear, ""You need to consider how you're perceived by leadership because this will affect your year end review."" Better yet, they manage by results knowing nothing of the floor because all they know is staring at spreadsheets. This place is the most unconnected, unorganized organization I have seen. It lacks leadership from the top as they have no connection to the floor. Executive leadership is worse, doesn't matter because the plant manager doesn't advocate for the customer or for the people. I give this place 3 years before it gets shut down and moved to Mexico and Poland.
Office politics would get in the way from time to time.
No personal time/sick time. Only 2 weeks of vacation time is allotted at the start, but you have an option to buy an extra week of vacation.
None that I can think of
As with most large organizations, there are times when Eaton doesn't react in a quick manner.
Opportunity for advancement unfairly leveraged Some managers lead from their office Large gap in compensation between workers and office personnel Repetitive and sometimes boring work Outdated facility that feels too cramped for the number of employees
No cons to give at this point in time
Large company size makes it challenging to move quickly given the need to involve stakeholders.
High stress environment at times
Market drven so Q3 and Q4 are challenging as well as associated cost outs were common practice
I was recently laid off due to company's business direction/strategy change, and my position was eliminated. Fortunately I had been looking for other opportunities outside of the company before I was laid off, so the next job had been already aligned when I was informed lay-off. There are multiple negative factors as below in this company. - Double standard between senior management and working level - Strong favoritism in the group - Lack of transparency about company decision - Lack of communication about group/division's business environment - Too many locations to work on one product whereas limited/no opportunity to work together face to face (except senior management which does not do actual work) - Lack of knowledge toward vehicle development in emerging technologies If you would like to enhance your career in new emerging technologies of vehicle world, there are many other companies to choose from.
No cons everyone was nice and friendly
A little crazy now to go through the changes
No movement in career, bad management, bad raises, union disagreements between depts
Health insurance kind of sucks
required covid vax to work
Not set up for remote work Lacks Procedures and training
Feels like limited growth opportunities
Pay needs improvement. Locations are remote
Difficult to climb the ladder
The company is huge and therefore often siloed, but the enthusiasm to break walls and collaborate is real. It’s a great time to see teams and the systems within evolve.
Hard to advance unless you are part of the right network..
Supervisors heavily played favorites among employees.
Not an excellent salary, not a lot of opportunities
Nothing that I can think of
Often the corporate red tape can be restrictive
Vacation time is garbage. The locations are really rough so if you get moved around, there is a huge possibility that you will be placed somewhere in the country or away from larger cities.
Some strategic plans the senior leadership made are kind of confusing.
still loving the job .
No downsides noted, quite reliable
Trying to convert the aerospace into a commercial site was challenging.
Minimal training. Machines are not maintained.
low work flow, and low motivation to people.
No work life balance. People are severely overworked
Overworked. Too many hrs a week
Company struggles to innovate, very risk adverse. Teams are becoming to spread out with a lot of focus on offshoring technical capabilities. This makes the product and its designers too separated.
Large disaggregated organization. Needs to take on ""blue ocean"" projects.
A large percentage of the office works from home, so the office is like a ghost town. The issue is there is little to no team camaraderie. Moral seems the lowest its ever been when we show up to the office.
You can't switch positions within the company within 2 years.
can get lost in the crowd
Health benefits could be better
There are several challenges with supply chain.
the hours are crazy and there is way to much drama everywhere you turn
Not too many things come to mind.
Much like other industrial jobs, there is favors that are given to certain employees that are not presented to others.
The software they make us use is ancient.
The union is ridiculous here . They are constantly trying to force you to be a part of the union and if you don't become a member they harass you the entire time your at work
Insulting raises despite gaining knowledge in every position in the facility
Promotions are not always based on success or ability.
Limited vertical movement within organization
could do better with Communication
Working as a Sales Engineer at Eaton has been a challenging and disheartening experience, primarily due to the toxic work environment, lack of adequate training, and combative coworkers. From day one, I was thrown into the deep end without any proper guidance or support. One of the major issues I encountered was the lack of training provided on bid manager. It is disconcerting to join a company and be expected to perform tasks without the necessary knowledge or skills. Eaton University's basic training simply did not suffice, leaving me ill-prepared for the demands of the role. As a Sales Engineer, bid management is a crucial aspect, and the absence of comprehensive training in this area has been a significant setback. Furthermore, the presence of hostile coworkers only exacerbated the challenges I faced. Instead of fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, I encountered colleagues who were uncooperative, competitive, and often combative. This created a toxic atmosphere that made it difficult to work effectively and productively. Adding to the frustration, the area sales manager lacked training in bid management, further hindering my professional growth. It is disconcerting to be under the leadership of someone who does not possess the necessary expertise in a crucial aspect of the job. This not only impacted my ability to perform but also eroded my confidence in the company's management and commitment to employee development. Additionally, building relationships with distributors proved to be a daunting task. Many distributors expressed dissatisfaction with working with Eaton, which added an extra layer of complexity to my responsibilities as a Sales Engineer. It is disheartening to find oneself in a situation where external partners have reservations about collaborating with the company. To make matters worse, the prevalent attitude among sales engineers of ""faking it until you make it"" is deeply concerning. It undermines the importance of proper training and proficiency in a field that demands expertise and knowledge. This mindset perpetuates a culture of mediocrity and hinders professional growth and development. In conclusion, my experience as a Sales Engineer at Eaton has been marked by a toxic work environment, a lack of training in critical areas, combative coworkers, an inadequately equipped area sales manager, and difficulties in collaborating with distributors. These factors have greatly impacted my ability to perform my job effectively and have left me feeling disheartened. I hope that Eaton takes these concerns seriously and makes significant improvements to create a more supportive and conducive work environment for its employees.
•Long hours •There isn't any air conditioning in the warehouse and it often gets 99+ degrees in there in the summertime •High turnover •Little room for advancement
Very technical internal relationships, takes time to ndevr stand positions and perform well
Zero work life balance. Constant weekend overtime.
Health insurance is awful especially if having to put family or kids have medical issues. The pay for amount of work you do tends to not line up.
Antiquated processes, toxic culture and mid management has no comprehension of processes.
Travel is required and not always convenient
Management and sometimes mandatory overtime when there are no parts to run.
Promotions are not always based on success or ability.
Limited vertical movement within organization

Nothing special, work loads on some people are too much
The day to day organization is a disaster with way too much turnover and too much focus on specific financial metrics. It can be nearly impossible to get things done because of all of the turnover and lack of processes. HR parades around all day about how great they are and how much they care, but are no where to be found when you have an issue, including compensation errors. Despite the mediocre internal employee survey results and poor ratings on external sites, the organization continues to lecture employees on how great they are and mansplain away the poor results. Most of HR and many of the managers are professional presentation givers who attend meetings with each other all day to promote themselves while leaving employees with no support. The ""most ethical"" company claim is a complete farce.

I didn’t have any negatives
Career Growing Paper Shifts Old Restroom
Travel is required and not always convenient
HR is a major problem. You ""hear"" about following the policies, but when it comes time to deal with people who do not follow the policy, you cannot get the results needed to continue achieving your goals. Company needs to take a more neutral position on political and LGBTQ topics insteading leaning far left. People in charge ( engineering, managers, safety, HR, planners) often do not work well enough together speaking with 1 voice.
It's not very easy to move up in the company unless you're in good with the leadership. Leadership is too busy saving money to supply the tools and repair the equipment needed for day to day work. Management is out of touch and dont know anything about the manufacturing process.
Outdated work environment and software, high turnover
I have found nothing wrong with this company in the year that I have been here.
Culture needs to be revived.
The company does not care about their employees.
large company that can be difficult to navigate at times
Company leaders emphasize the importance of retaining employees, however they only will retain you if you abide by their micromanagement. Your individual culture work experience depends upon what division and site you are at. No training for manager positions when onboarded but expected to know everything. Growth and development opportunities always mentioned but you have to wait 2 full years and have approval from direct manager before being able to even apply and need their permission. Toxic culture and leadership. Company has 0 work life balance and expects you to work 24/7 because that’s just the way the company has always been. Be ready to work on your PTO days. You might have a “seat at the table” but that doesn’t mean you have a voice at it sadly. Not a good fit for anybody under the age of 30.
Large organization, sometimes it becomes difficult to get things done quicker .
transition between roles, not fully remote
Departments can be siloed at times.
None. Loved my time working there.
Large organization and moves very slowly.
Lack of training, lack of support
Nothing I can think of.
Week management, low salaries, low diversity
management direction lack of opportunity
-This job can require a LOT of travel depending on your office location. It can be difficult to balance personal and work life. Best suited for the highly independent. -This job is dangerous. Working closely with high voltage systems and new hazards at every job site. -Some work requires little to no critical thinking and is just manual labor. I have used little of my engineering degree.
a little laid back, could be a little faster.
This is eaton company work so good
Departments can be siloed at times.
You have a consistent workload almost every day coming in!
Toxic work environment, unethical, common biggetty, sexism- women will have to fight for promotions
None. Loved my time working there.
if you are diverse, it is a very tough place to be, there is minimal diversity in most of the locations and I have been to a lot of them there was a lot of racism that was covert, so you couldn't pinpoint it; however, it was very tough for a minority.
Management, Mandatory Overtime, 1 Sunday every other week off
Large organization and moves very slowly.
Lack of training, lack of support
Building was outdated, and management didn't seem to want to put any money or effort into updating it. Not many young people working at this facility. The company also didn't offer any amenities that most workplaces offer their employees.
Nothing I can think of.

- Old guard are still on their way out - Many POs are out of touch with how to manage the platforms they own, as they are not keeping up with the technology well enough - Corporate shake-ups can be off-putting
I don't have any cons.
- Prudential tends to be very metrics based and cares heavily about the company statistics.
No cons. Absolutely loved working with Prudential Financial.
As with other companies, lay offs, cost cutting initiatives are quite frequent at the moment
Medical benefits steadily worsened over recent years.
Cost cutting has resulted in many competent and necessary people gone.

- limited impact on the team - hard to get noticed in such a large business - limited opportunity to learn outside of your direct role
While this is a Fortune 500 company, multiple Prudential Investment arm teams are overworked and don't have a great work culture. Senior management doesn't care much about employees' well-being and work-life balance. They expect you to work almost 7 days a week (for weeks and months) to meet their astronomical prediction to deliver complex effort. On top of that manager scolds the entire team for falling behind the timeline. Forget about saying thanks or acknowledging your hard work and sacrifices made by you/your family for working over the weekends/long nights. Bottomline: If looking for a new job, stay away from Investment House unless you can't find another job.
very limited career opportunity for most
Very little room for growth. Majority of management positions are filled internally from other areas. Often times the person hired never worked in that area as well.
Stuck in old way of lead gen, they nickel and dime their sales reps charging for everything and you basically are broke at the start and that's when they nickel and dime you the most. Takes forever sometimes to get a policy written
Terrible health insurance. 401K match only 4%
Pay did not equal role.
The culture is starting to change due to management continuing to focus on cutting costs.
All about making 50 dials a day to make appointments to try and get strangers to agree to give their cash value in their policies or other investments to Prudential or it’s affiliates through Crump brokerage. It is 100% commission with some reimbursement during the CDP training program if you meet thresholds.
An aggressive push back into office at a new location pushed me away.
some promotions clearly based on time employed there vs. production, lack of credit for individual accolades, pay less than competitors, hard to enter from the outside
low pay. should be in line with the industry
Commission only structure makes it difficult to get started-- CDP program is to train candidates on how to sell, they give you up to 6 months to bring in $10,000 GDR if you cant do it then you fail out. You're paid 59% of what you bring in, its very difficult to do and if you're not passionate about life insurance try another broker focused more on the wealth management/financial planning side.
Get thrown into the mix real fast once you start
The work load at times was alot, lack of growth
None that I can really think of
long hours and lots of travel
Not convenient for people from NYC to commute to work.
Unpaid while you are attaining licenses.
Changes are made in a random manner
no base bay, most FAs make around 20k a year. commissions only mean no matter if you are sick, you want a vacation or you are on parental leave, there is no benefit. Well, there is..... but only if you still have revenue. Where does those revenue comes from? You have to keep selling insurance and annuities. They will let you keep calling their existing clients or friends and family, brining them in, and keep exchanging their current clients' insurance and annuities, a lot FAs don't care what's best for the client, they keep replacing those policies so he can get paid. Even those senior ""successful"" advisors, they are only make 100k plus, and you can easily get paid that amount anywhere else. For who ever get paid over 100k here, they have been in business as least for 15 years, and that's a low salary comparing to experiance. When you leave, they mail you a collection ticket to collect some money they already paid you. The more revenue you had, the more you have to pay them back, it's ridiculous.
The pay could be higher.
Lots of middle management has left and new management is undertrained. Expectations used to be manageable but with “transformations” happening the shift in expectations have become unmanageable. New hires do not last and management takes forever to onboard new employees. There is also the issue of antiquated IT systems and numerous contradictory ways to get the information you need to do your job. With new expectations these outdated systems hold you back and lead to bad outcomes for anyone involved. The point of the job is to help people, we cannot help them when organizationally we are setup with IT infrastructure from the 2000nds and everyone else has different ways to do things. There is no standardization in processes, middle management is constantly changing, IT is outdated, and turnover is a huge problem.It’s time to head for the door.
Not all of the management are on the same level and need more experience.
Higher management distance Low market pay
Mandatory OT because of lack of workers on PTO. Ridiculous metrics too meet with weekly team huddles to compare you against your peers. Not always assistance out of training. Thrown into the lions den once in coaching phase with coach rarely being available and you can sit fir hours waiting on a response. Alot of favoritism, if you were favored then you got help instantly, if not, then go figure 😉.
The training is awful. I spent way too much time independently studying procedures and manuals, all of which are more helpful if you already have basic knowledge in the products and processes already. They don't vet their trainers well, some of them should absolutely not be training new hires. I came away from some trainings more confused than when I first went in. I even ended up finding information during all those independent study sessions that contradicted what my manager was teaching us. When I voiced my concerns, asked for help, and requested some accommodations I was told no. Not indirectly, mind you, just no. Everyone had to go through the same training, on the same schedule even if that schedule didn't work for the assigned trainer. Yet it was somehow up to me to know what the trainers schedule was.

No cons very good culture
none that I can think of
Constantly more things added to job with not much of an increase in pay
It can take a long time to move up and out to become an external.
The company's benefits package keeps shrinking and getting more expensive. They are cutting staffs down too much which creates a large amount of stress for mid level employees and below.
Too many people on same function
Constant layoffs every six months. It’s nearly predictable timing in Nov & May. And it isn’t exclusive toward poor performers. They will even lay off, pay a severance and then rehire the same employee 2 years later. Promotions to director and above are rare. When they do happen, it’s all political and not job performance related.
Very big company sometime tough to find what you need

It’s a large and bureaucratic organization with many leaders who need to agree and align, and they often don’t. It’s hard to make meaningful progress without that and leadership has been slow to take action even when there is recognition that it is needed.

I genuinely have no real negatives from this internship; I would absolutely recommend this internship to anyone who would like to go into corporate real estate.
Work/life balance can be difficult depending on the group.
SOC envrionment analyst are not respected and get treated differently from everyone in the company. The upper managers have total disrespect for the SOC team. Great company just avoid the CSOC, terrible work-life balance.
They always work overtime hours
Really not much to be said. At worst, it's the cost cutting times that the company has been in.
the culture is changing and it looks like the good folks are leaving
At the time that I was there, there was a structural change in how work was processed which actually slowed down review time. I felt that the ""great"" idea looked good on paper but wasn't realistic to process the work to meet SLA's. Wholesalers would be rude to own Prudential employees, and overall felt that this change was unethical for the company. I decided to leave earlier than intended because it was way too crazy with unfortunately not enough support.

There was a leadership changeover in the technology organization, which left it in disarray and created a toxic political environment. Except for the lowest levels, promotions aren't automatic. Either an open position at that level must exist, and you can apply for it (a job transfer), or you can persuade your manager to eliminate your position and create a position at a higher level (presumably for your additional capabilities); however, that is a competitive open position that anyone internal or external can apply for. If you aren't selected, you cannot go back to your old position, and run the risk of losing your job and being terminated.

Terrible training. Terrible support when finally through training. They rely strictly on chat for assistance and managers tell you to “reach out to a senior res presentation” for help. When I’m reality those representatives have no incentive to help you, so why would they. You’re stuck on calls waiting for assistance and never receive a response. If you do. The call is already over by then. Everyone has a different understanding of product. Ask 5 different senior reps a question, you will get 5 different answers. Lack of adequate training and support makes this job a nightmare unfortunately. No help line for support. Just chat.
First and foremost, the technology (if you can call it that) is archaic and unbelievably outdated. There is no “ease” of doing business, even the most simple and mundane tasks like opening an account are complicated. Clients and advisors can find better investment tools for free online anywhere. Management and support are non-existent. They make it easy to sell anything proprietary (Prudential Products), but much more difficult to sell financial and insurance products from other providers. Call wait time for head office support is ridiculously long. When you reach out to a manager for help or support they refer you to someone else who refers you to someone else. It gets very frustrating. They show you a great compensation package when you start. However, they fail to tell you about all the expenses and costs they deduct from your pay or about all the high out of pocket costs you are directly responsible for.
The job is a commission based job.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Food-Lion-Reviews-E16998.htm,"Good people and good hours
Food Lion is one of the better grocery chains to work for in the region. They pay better than Ingles & Food City. There always seems to be a chance to work more hours if you want them. A good employee nucleus with the long term employees who are a wealth of knowledge and full of kindness. Employees are constantly thanked for helping the customers and the count on me mindset really helps us take care of customers and fellow coworkers. Work and life balance is good and asking off for important dates usually gets approved.
Experience in managing a team: yes but the turnover rate is insane, you can't build a good team here. Customer service skills: Customers are generally nice, you talk to a good bit of people Food handling and preparation knowledge: They are very strict about doing things by the book, however it almost never happens and they cut corners everywhere. They wouldn't even check the temp of the food sometimes, it would be so busy they're just going.
I have always worked on really good teams at Food Lion. Leadership has always been supportive of my career endeavors and helped me grow. I think most of the people I work with are very genuine. They really love the company and have helped me to see the advantages of working for the company.

","No phones, no sitting, and basically nothing fun
Quality of pay is still lacking and needs to improve. It's gotten better especially with new management being opened to discussing this topic. Even if the region is lower cost of living, the base pay rate is still too low. Also, factoring in cost of living on the rise, company sales continue to grow, employee pay should reflect that. Employees keep hearing about record sales, while hours get cut (in the past) the week after.
Toxic work environment, employees and managers essentially get away with bullying other staff. Hours: They say they can give you 30+ hours but then after a week of two it drops anywhere from 12-15 hours a week... a lot of empty promises High-stress environment: This store is the only grocery store in town so it is extra busy. Plus you're already overworked and understaffed. Limited growth opportunities
I enjoy the flexibility of a hybrid schedule however I would prefer having 2 days in the office rather than 3 because of my commute.
work environment could be better
Management wasn’t the best at communication
Its retail and retail hours
Standing in feet all day, yelling customers, holidays/bad weather. ...gets extremely busy, called in on day off a lot.
10 minute break No discount Workload(need 2 more associates)
Wish we gave associate discount while shoppping
I was never able to clock in or out of the system they were using at the time
Horrible schedule Not really a long term job unless you work full time No discounts or amazing benefits Late November & December are definitely the worst time to work No overtime allowed due to the fact managers want a bonus
It's a Food Lion, you have to talk to a lot of older people that always think they're right.
Even full time, pays less than the cost of living in the area. Corporate interference in store operations. Front-end workers lose hours based on store sales, making it hard for everyone. Constant turnover. Management favors customer complaints over employee testimony. Track record does not matter.
I have to work so I go to work
Short staff, coworkers who are bad at their job being kept only because nobody is there to replace them. Corporate is very out of touch with what goes on at stores. Benefits not very good outside of dental.
Terrible middle and upper management. Very narrow range of acceptable uniform options (that they do not provide). The workload is absurd, you will be expected to do 3 times the work you would do at any other grocery store. Some departments get truck shipments every other day of the week whether or not the product is needed. Meaning there's a lot of waste. You will lose hours every day just throwing away expired food. Extremely anti union and will fire you the moment they believe you're even thinking of it. No joke their ""classroom"" style hiring/onboarding meeting we had spent 40 minutes talking about why they think unions are bad and the consequences for trying to join one because of it.
- My best friend (assistant manager of the store) lost his job because he chased a shoplifter in his car. The thieves made off with 5/6 of the cases of beer. - The store that I work at is a converted BiLo and they didn't bother repairing the floors in the back. I have gotten pallets of dirt and water stuck because of how worn down parts of the floor is.
End up doing more than your own job entitles
Despite being one of the busiest Food Lion delis in the region by a wide margin, store management keeps hours low and allows for cut corners such as leaving hot food out hours past its time, and the business leads to some employees cutting corners such as not properly cleaning up after raw chicken, not temping food before putting it out for customers to eat, and other concerning things that put people's health at risk.
Some of their technology is outdated when it comes to ordering and product management. They cut hours as much as possible for departments, forcing employees to get in trouble or wrote up for going over the scheduled hours, even though the job is not finished/shelf is empty. Often times associates may do things that are not standard practice, or short cuts in order to save time and get everything done. Their statisicians and supply chain experts really have no idea what goes on at an associate level, Awarded hours(per department) and work processes have no consideration for consumer trends and product popularity. This often An example of this is their diagrams/schemes/planagrams for shelf display. Often times, my department and team members had to adjust shelf displays for products due to local/customer popularity, and we consistently had to order extra, or the opposite, cut items out of the order because we knew they wouldn't sell/go bad on the shelf. However, their system would keep sending them in, or telling us to order them. Understanding, each company pays for a certain amount of shelf space, but it's also an employees moral, and profession obligation to ensure your trying to adjust and make the company as much money as you can, and making sure the customer gets what they want.
Some management are not properly trained
Inconsistent hours especially during downtime
Too understanding sometimes, allow people to do whatever depending on what manager was working each shift.
Horrible schedule Not really a long term job unless you work full time No discounts or amazing benefits Late November & December are definitely the worst time to work No overtime allowed due to the fact managers want a bonus
Can have long hours, inventory is brutal, can get dirty
The only major cons are holidays. You are working in retail so no day is an off day beside Christmas.
At times they don't pay you your whole pay check and everybody is trying to tell others what to do
Lack of Training of Staff

Shifting leadership, asked to go above and beyond
Pay is not the best but you get small raises every year
The workload vs pay Corporate cutting corners
Long Hours-10 hr days, often don’t get breaks Low PTO Grid
No bonus and long hours.
Food Lion does not like to pay well for the amount of work that is required for this job,
Corporate sucks, they are constantly complaining if things are not done a certain way but the people creating these rules have probably never worked in one of our stores before. The upper management (assistant and store managers) did practically nothing but delegate work to everyone else, also the current ones at my store did not even know how to run a register properly. Front end is held to a higher standard than every other department but is paid the least in the store. Multiple deli associates at my store were caught stealing and nothing happened to them. Smokers would essentially take a 10 minute break every hour with no repercussions.
The pay isn’t worth the stress they put on you. I don’t know how things have changed since I left, but they were extremely short staffed and the old manager didn’t hire people.
You’ll have slow days and fast days and getting carts is a real workout when your short handed
Hours. Short staffed. Wages are low

They pay isn’t that great.
Low pay for work, not sustainable

No sense of teamwork or humanity
Lacks an atmosphere of any sort.
They play too much when it comes to promotions. They will literally expect you to do the job without the pay and then finally promote you after you’ve done it for awhile.
As many people have experienced the turnover in different locations since Covid,but getting better.
There were no cons! great place
Constantly needing new people due to little pay
The hour pay is not big, sometimes hours are cut or not being given many.
Janitorial Work is unecessary for scope
Cons Pay Management Rude Customers
Low pay, uniforms suck bad
Pay is not the best but you get small raises every year
Training on register wasn’t very clear, lots of things left out
The higher up management at the store and at head quarters because I was working full time listed as part time and come to find out they didn't take enough taxes out all year while I was claiming 0 single. I was employed here 3 years and the last year this happened
Long Hours-10 hr days, often don’t get breaks Low PTO Grid
Food Lion does not like to pay well for the amount of work that is required for this job,
Poor upper management. Hard to move up unless you are a kiss a**. Can get into trouble over small/ridiculous issues. Bi-weekly paychecks. Management hardly cares about whatever issues you’ve got going on, ex: if you call out over a sickness, death, pretty much anything it seems as if unless you’re a favorite they don’t really care to understand rather question you, get mad and act rude/ignore you when they see you/demand evidence whether it’s a Dr. note, obituary… etc which I understand to an extent but they do this even if they’ve known about the issue in which you’re calling out over or they write you up. Before I left I got wrote up for calling out due to pregnancy sickness and one time I even had a note from the Dr.
Pay No bonus Not appreciated
not a sustainable job to pay bills, out of work at times, yelled at superiors
You’ll have slow days and fast days and getting carts is a real workout when your short handed
Not a lot of room for growth and
Working 9pm to 5-6am Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday and 3-11pm on Mondays. It sucks. Never have a weekend. You don’t vacation time the first year… have to wait till year 2 for a break. People get hired and quit almost immediately. High turnover. Managing a bunch of dudes that don’t want to work and then getting talked to about working “too much” and told I need to “stop working so hard”?? Weird. Also got hired in making $23 an hour and was only getting $21 for months before I noticed. Nobody did anything about it. I’m not the only one that happened too, so if you work for Food Lion check your pay stubs!
The list is endless…..long hours, you are expected to live there, you have zero chance of success, hourly associates can literally do whatever they wish and simply call some line and they get a pass.
Not very good pay for the work you do, management is only concerned about themselves but want you to be a team player, if you get into a good store it might not be an issue.
Turnover after pandemic leads to you supporting every department.

They pay isn’t that great.
Low pay for work, not sustainable
Lack of strict rules and competent employees
Associates are not consistently held accountable so work load for those that do the work is heavy for the pay
Low pay and no room for growth, no raise.
The communication from the mangers
Everything is a big con.
Part time employees could only work approximately 56 hours every 2 weeks, and full time jobs were limited.
Favoritism definitely plays a role. Unreal expectations with a small stock crew
Technology and layout are somewhat outdated
Horrible managers, no opportunities to advance in positions, bad pay, rarely any pay raises

","Far commute for me. Bonus is not guaranteed.
Covid has caused teams to be no show in the office and other teams suffer from it.
Lower pay, programs kept changing or canceling, so the team kept shifting gears which makes for lot of lost time and causes confusion. A lot of unknowns.
Since WDC took over, company benefits are in the down hill trend. Unlimited PTO policy really means no PTO. You need to “fight” time off with coworkers. And you have to explain to your manager why you are taking time off “again”. As to management, flash group turned a family business. The VPs, Sr directors, they are all friends and buddies, hang out at family level, bbq at each other’s home on weekends. Some even brag about their closeness with the bosses. If you are in that circle, you will have a good roles, get promotions. Reward far exceed efforts. If you are not in the circle, you can work 16 hours a day, so real meaningful works, yet, get a pad on the shoulder only. And worst, get more assignments because they know you can get things done. You are simply their tools. At the time of layoff, you will sure be on the chopping block long before their family members. They blatantly act like this in your face as if saying “yes, we are like this, so what, what can you do”. I am very disappointed at this manage style.
Financially in a bad shape (as of 2023) Salary and bonuses are not good NAND is cyclical
challenging markets, strong competitors and dependent on a few large, demanding customers on the enterprise side
Cyclical industry with ups and downs, not high growth business. No bonuses during downcycle environment
weak executive leadership, lacking to navigate the company
No food accommodations, office space is not the best, could use a remodel. Suspended 401k and STIs indefinitely because the company is losing money.
Bad management, bad business choice,
Reorganization and reductions in workforce that get rid of good people.
Cyclical industry with ups and downs, not high growth business. No bonuses during downcycle environment
top-down management reorganizations need to be well thought out
Because they are a global company, you have to maintain flexible hours and sometimes have meetings and phone calls in the evening to work with those locations.
Not very exciting and repetitive work
Hybrid work environment- not full remote
high turnover rate, reducing benefit
Too much turnover, difficult to accomplish tasks
Bad management, bad business choice,
Business uncertainty. The management is not able to set the long-term target right. The engineering teams cannot focus and execute.
Not very generous with paid time off.
top-down management reorganizations need to be well thought out
- They play favorites - Generally not competitive - Lost many seasoned engineers with no background ups - Development team lost many heads and are in a very weak position - Organizations are heavily bloated by management - Executive leadership team keeps making poor business decisions and pushing woke ideologies
Poor leadership from Directors and up. Culture from when it was WD/HGST has changed significantly. Lots of organizational challenges. Too many layers of management. Morale has been declining for years. Flash industry is weak.
Because they are a global company, you have to maintain flexible hours and sometimes have meetings and phone calls in the evening to work with those locations.
Top Management sucks No Clear Direction from Upper Management CEO compensation is very high No clear leadership
Not very exciting and repetitive work
Management going overboard with tasks.
Once my boss lefts, the group I was in closed down and I moved position putting product into production. The requirements are 12-14 hours a day, with meetings called at 8am and 8pm 4 days a week, with lots of requirement in between. When I commented to my new management, I was told it used to be worse, we have it good. To add to that, the buisness is not doing well, and benefits have been reduced.
Hybrid work environment- not full remote
high turnover rate, reducing benefit
I feel compelled to share my experience working at Western Digital as it has been a source of immense dissatisfaction. The company's poor management, ineffective leadership, low compensation, lack of motivation, long work hours, and recent removal of benefits have contributed to an overall demoralizing work environment. One of the most concerning aspects of my time at Western Digital has been the lackluster management. Decision-making processes appear disorganized and detached from the realities of the workforce. The leadership, particularly the CEO, has demonstrated a lack of vision and direction, leading to a decline in progress and a sense of hopelessness among employees. Compensation has been a significant letdown, with salaries falling well below industry standards. The remuneration offered does not reflect the level of responsibility and effort required in our roles. This has resulted in a notable lack of motivation and decreased morale across the company. Furthermore, the long hours of work have become the norm, leading to burnout and a poor work-life balance. The expectation to consistently put in extra hours without proper compensation or recognition has created an unsustainable work environment. It is disheartening to witness the removal of employee benefits such as the 401k, gym access, and bonuses. These changes have left employees feeling undervalued and unsupported. Coupled with the company's precarious cash position, it has added to the overall sense of instability and uncertainty. Western Digital's decline in progress and market position is evident. The lack of innovative strategies and a clear path forward raises concerns about the company's future viability and success.
Pay is low. Benefit is cheap. Bonus is small.
The company is in a serious downturn. Poor upper management and not competitive compensation among the peers in the industry.
hard to seek promotion and no bonus at this time.
WD has acquired many other big companies, HGST, and SanDisk being the biggest. This has led to a having a lot of upper management, organizations spread out all over the world, and annoying geo-politics.
Terrible and dishonest management No clear path for growth
C-Level team is not from industry and is a disaster. BOD is terrible for hiring team. Too many Execs from Cisco. They are learning on job and have failed. Layoffs is the only strategy to deliver business targets.
Could be more flexible in approach to Projects & team.
Inefficient management due to lack of technical skills. Not employees friendly. They would do anything to cut costs. Two layoffs within a year. They are asking people to come back on-site even when the work could be done remotely. Highly likely Kioxia merge will happen and result in more layoffs
More traditional work culture, large age gap between new engineers and experienced engineers.
Not much room for advancement
Nothing is consistent in the company. It starves itself of basic investments to hit quarterly profitability numbers. The result of this is over-worked, under-resourced team members. It also means 50+ years of bandaids on basic tools and systems which causes some major inefficiencies and pointless problems. You'll find a lot of those issues at any public company though. At least that's what everyone at Western Digital tells themselves to cope with all the headaches.
Below average benefits for health.
None love every single day
Company depends on layoffs too much
Career Growth and work flexibility
Abrupt changes in the team In most the team- reporting to someone else & you do work for someone else No signs of career development & growth No clear guidance from managers
Collaboration with staff worldwide creates long workdays. Managing Work-Life Balance is challenging.
Not a job for the long term. Unforgiving high ranking managers. Bloated management organization.
I don`t have a con for the company
Nothing comes to my mind.
Time management and projects get hectic.
no other cons that I can add
Barely any benefits left, and those were crappy to begin with. CEO and executive team is useless and doesn't communicate anything of substance, they show up once a quarter for AHM only. It took the CEO a month to send employees an e-mail regarding the data breach. Pathetic.
Managers are often out of touch with technology and workplace morale
Constant restructuring and layoffs. Need a better and systematic approach towards organizational structuring
Work long hours specially 12
No snacks in office, dinosaur of a company, way too many people doing low impact work
- Limited growth in career - Irregular yearly bonus / annual payment due to budget issues

Bad Process, need time to learn
Downsides is the rate of churn at the senior leadership level causing a lot of turbulence.
Managers are often out of touch with technology and workplace morale

Do not follow their corporate philosophies
- The memory market is extremely cyclical, expect good times but also bad times - They could do better with the benefits - Not always a lot of room for career improvements
No snacks in office, dinosaur of a company, way too many people doing low impact work
My commute was too far
- Limited growth in career - Irregular yearly bonus / annual payment due to budget issues
layoffs, legacy affiliation cultural inconsistencies, suspended 401k and bonus, slow career growth, continuing education
- Upper management doesn't have a clear sense of direction or seem in touch with employees - Below market compensation
The way they handle a downturn cycle and decide to do massive layoffs with no heads up.
Not much grow potential in career.
It often felt like the HD and SSD sides of the company weren't as aligned as I would have liked, from a marketing standpoint.
the job gets more stressful overtime
Bad management overall. Lots of politics
Nothing that I would change
Maybe they should plan for social activities
A shrinking industry can be a prolem
Do not follow their corporate philosophies
the management is really bad
- The memory market is extremely cyclical, expect good times but also bad times - They could do better with the benefits - Not always a lot of room for career improvements
My commute was too far
Promotion means more work same pay
The new leadership that crossed over from Cisco is extremely unpleasant to work for. In order to oust old staff and bring in more of their friends they used tactics such as positioning minor problems to be much bigger than they really are and using those as excuses to put people on performance improvement programs. I have personally seen senior directors brought to tears and once confident and proactive staff reduced to quiet quitting. While all this is going on, the company routinely sends out mandatory computer based training about ethics, respect, and so on. This is to check a box for investors or insurance companies. Make no mistake: Joining the marketing function at this company puts you squarely in the crosshairs of people who get what they want, one way or the other.
Management is terrible To many politics with SanDisk Hired like crazy in 2022 then 9 months later people get laid off. Employees told that it’s a supply chain. The chain supply issue has been an issue since Covid started. To many senior people making lots of money and not caring about the little people who do all the work in the back
Everything else- not competitive at all
-Clean room quality -High precision machines
work load for different groups varies a lot, some group require 24/7 engineer support.
Less pay Niche field No RSU
Management from Cisco came in a derailed the entire operation. No faith in the competency of the upper management.
It often felt like the HD and SSD sides of the company weren't as aligned as I would have liked, from a marketing standpoint.
bad, unaware management micromanagement poor delivery, bloated positions not enough technical focus
Lack of stock options, Salary not competitive.
Bad management who micromanage and support their old friends
Late meetings, no time management, stress scheduling
Nothing that I would change
Maybe they should plan for social activities

Stabe Job that gives gives you peace of mind
This is the worst company to work on the face of the planet
Tangible HR personnel, strong teamwork to see orders to completion on professional lines, pay is alright to start, possible advancement mobility with the right research and hard work, not as a promotion from seeing how hard a person works, but discovering it for yourself and making progress towards your goal.

This company has some of the best pay and benefits in our community, including up to 18 paid weeks for parental leave and a $500 a year Lifestyle Reimbursement. Employees are reimbursed for sporting equipment, student loan payments, tax planning, or whatever they want to use that benefit for. The onsite company store with discounted products is another great perk. Manufacturing wages are above other companies in this area and the insurance is pretty extensive for a reasonable price. They even offer fertility benefits and mental health.

Competitive salaries consistent culture environments moment
","Sometimes no work life balance.
Lots of change and re-orgs taking place. Often times it seems like there is no strategy and changes are happening at the drop of a hat with a complete lack of communication. Change management is seriously lacking. Lots of middle managers that have no business being managers.
Rotations are quick (typically one year) and don't give you much time to operate at peak effectiveness (6-8 months in.) Post program support drops off and you will be forced to manage your career. You will do senior analyst work and not be compensated accordingly.
High turn over its a lot of work and management picks at every single detail you do instead of appreciating that you just did 70 plus stops in all weather delivering multiple 45 pound water jugs in an high traffic urban environment
Toughs nights and sometimes harsh deadlines
This is one of the worst companies to work. They violate human rights. You need permission to go to bathroom and you are yelled at for spending few mins extra in the bathroom. Coming 2 mins late is not acceptable. You need to make up well otherwise you will be called ""tired' and disinterested. If you have menstrual cramps, you will be yelled at. There is basic violation of human rights in this company. Stay away from this toxic workplace
Communication is lacking at times, high turnover (internal changes) in dept. supervisors without any notice given to employees, long hours on concrete without antifatigue mats at a multibillion dollar company...? Long hours, then sent home early x days, then long hours...inconsistencies make paying the monthly bills difficult. My credit score has suffered since working here.
Company culture and high workload
some bad co workers, no room to grow
there was no room foe growth you get judged or made to feel guilty when you request pto high stress micromanagement dysfunctional teams played favorites no diversity expected to be at your computer at all times

Downsizing constantly across the board
Eaely morning or late night shifts
The environment is quite cold
nestle is an unethical company and management isnt very good
They could dare to make more changes in every country looking for what each consumer in each specific country needs because they only focus in the original country (Suiza). The changes or actions have to be at the moment and whan the consumer needs. In Nestle if you want to do something could las one year or more.
Daily meetings to review every order(holy micromanagement) Everyone is paid the same and there is no pay negotiation- so if you have more experience you are not paid for it.
Croweded, Busy, bad listening skills.
Hard, less motivating environment, stressfull
Improved onboarding needed to make employees feel welcome
Hard to get promoted and HR is terrible
Lots of mandatory overtime and 12 h+ shifts
Factory may be closing soon.
There is a lot to learn and you must pay very close attention to safety and quality to make sure the employees and consumers are safe. (Not exactly a con, but this isn't a place where people can coast through their job.) There can also be heavy overtime at times up to a maximum number of hours.
better sales bonus per quarter
The US CEO and leadership have created a burn and churn culture- you do great so we’re going to ask you to do more and give more of your discretionary time to the company with no compensation or additional resources. The US CEO and leadership are totally out of touch with employees- they never interact with anyone but themselves and other than visibility in pre-taped videos for Workplace, you never see them. The US CEO brings and old school, Jack Welch mentality - He doesn’t value employees, DEI, sustainability, he values his shareholders and profits and that is all. His sports analogies at every single town hall are tired, reek of old white guy pep talks and are totally out of touch with a diverse employee population. The recent decision to force employees back into the office after several high performing years in which flexible schedules were allowed was poorly communicated and is super hypocritical given that the US CEO never shows his face around the office and if he is there, only interfaces with his management team. He is so completely out of touch with what employees want and what they value. I’ve been there 5 years and have never met him or a member of the management team. Lastly, despite being the zone CEO, he only cares about the foods business. Thank god there are other leaders running Purina and Health Science where they have much stronger corporate cultures and respect their employees! Purina and Health Science are the growth generators for the business- he and his leadership team should really start paying attention to them and learning from their successes.
long days lots of expectations
In the office 3 days a week now
Changed working model without coming to employees first.
Toxic environment. Everyone is always in your personal business

Salary + Bonus + Process + Conservative + Speed
- Glass ceiling - Waves of time consuming work (busy work) - Invisible professional growth chart
The average pay rate is less than other companies in this industry
Low pay for high cost of living area, high stress, toxic environment at times.
Frankly speaking I have no experience to share in this regards, I spent 25 years with Mondeleze
At such a big company its possible that you feel like a cog in a giant machine as opposed to a valued member.
PTO policy needs work. Employees not appropriately compensated.
I can’t think of any
Disparate systems and providers make for a tough time getting things done efficiently
Some remote jobs are disappearing
the culture is structured to use and abuse you
Not all departments have a good salary
There’s none that i can think of
Routes, way of doing things, measurements change almost every year. Lots of secrecy.
take time to learn the things
None that I can think of
Mandatory overtime, had to have a ""leave on time schedule"" to leave on time at least once a month
Removed Remote option for flexibility
There is Corporate politics and bureaucracy
You'll be on your feet all day, working, and by the end of the day you'll be exhausted. There are easy days and sometimes difficult days. There are rude people but they are less rude than the good people around you.
Poisoning children was not great Did not like their breastfeeding scandal Probably not the most evil, but definitely the most successfully evil company.
Definitely has a corporate culture
Was not managed well under new umbrella. We were profitable but not to the new company's expatiations.
Growth opportunities are pretty limited
Not so great leadership depending on your location
None that I can think of.
Hard to advance very far
There are a lot of politics in a big organization, need to have a sponsor to move up.
No room to grow unless your there for years
Politics in management poor work life balance poor pay
High pressure, learning curve is steep
Sometimes, a lot of policiy changes
workload is too much for a 9-5 job
Too big - limited ability to move to most senior levels - lots of standardization. Slow to change and make decisions.
Doesn't take care of their company very well
work life balance, opportunity to grow
Almost half week are in reworks and early release
unethical promotion, manipulating uneducated mothers, pollution, price fixing and mislabeling
Try to take the product world wide
Terrible hours. Management pushes for production while working with old equipment.
sometimes SOPs and processes can be slow
Organization can be slow to react and has too much tribal knowledge. It does feel like a certain group has more opportunity than others and a surprising level of nepotism for such a large organization.
With IT pared down to minimum. Not a lot of opportunities to move up the ladder in IT.
No cons I can think of
Certain people in Management make it harder to do your job.
Horrible work environment on the factories. Change your schedule frequently. Zero life balance. Not training you must go by your self. They are not worry about employee. During interview they telling to you stuff that never happen.
Nothing else to say gray company
Long hours but managable. Overall great
None it's okay to work
Extremely long hours, bad management and low level of education, no soft skills.
Large company with a lot of politics
Lack of communication & safety precautions. Leadership is garbage.
No real cons to share at this point.

good benefits, great culture and excellent research
Top tier retirement benefit, paid public holidays, vacation accruals can be cashed out if unused when leaving USC. Plus there's also winter recess time off between Christmas and NYE. Great insurance---the trojan care EPO has great access to USC doctors at very affordable copay/deductible. Lyra health has annual free sessions for mental health. Supportive and flexible management. Plenty of job positions to switch to within the university.
Great employer with a lot of perks and you get to start early and leave early.
Very flexible work-study, good pay, good environment, fairly easy work, great coworkers, and frequent free food.
Easy job and helped pay for school
You can make a difference
Flexible work hours and working remotely
nice way to make a little money as a student
Great Faculty and a lot of opportunities for growth.
Easy, can do homework, mostly nice supervisors
People I worked with are nice
Good co workers, miss them
The professors at the school are all very smart and generally nice people to interact with.
Working at USC as a student is the best experience I could ask for
great opportunity for working on-campus and make some money and put it on resume too.
staff are friendly nice and sweet
Amazing opportunity where I was able to gain a lot of experience.
Hard to get fired and great benefits
Good work. Flexible timings. Work from home.
Everyone is nice and friendly in the office. Dr. Lyon cares a lot about his work and it's admirable to watch.
benefits including health and others
Great retirement benefits. Contribute 10% as long as you can stay within the company for four years. They also pay your units if you can get into a USC program. However, there are many limits and restraints to this. There is a lot of liberty and openness in certain departments.
No pros as afar as i know
Benefits and perks , people, network, time off
You can make a difference
Flexible work hours and working remotely
Team was supportive and collaborative. Access to advanced technology. PIs encouraged career development and still supportive after departure.
Quick processing, supportive staff and great lab. USC is a great employer especially for academic part-time positions.
Strong Benefits package. Interesting and enriching environment.
nice way to make a little money as a student
flexible, good environment, and nice colleagues
Job satisfaction, student interaction, work value
People I worked with are nice
Good co workers, miss them
good co workers and enviorment
flexible hours , high pay, nice professors
Supportive environment and flexibility with remote options.
Great place to work because of the benefit
Benefits are good, the work can be rewarding (when it's there), and the people on my team are great to work with/alongside
Guaranteed stipend for all years
Ideal institution to work as a student. Plenty of support and flexibility while also allowing room for growth.
Beautiful campus and environment to be a part of
Wonderful peers, good pay, great benefits
The culture of the school and the amenities were great! I loved the campus and some of the students were really nice
","pays litte many hours of work
- could improve with more organized communication - better planning for the project to unify the team - not notified when website was taken down and so I was unable to take some information for my portfolio
You have to pay a lot to park to come to work, and you have to pay more the more days you're on campus... which, as an admin, they would prefer be every day. They make the tuition benefit hard to use because you have to get into a program, and be able to complete it, but you also have to work full time, and most of the programs don't have enough after-work classes.
It's enough to help students with small expenses on the side; however, it can be difficult to schedule the perfect work and school schedule if you are a student from a low income background. I'd wish USC would be more understanding of financial situations instead of pushing students to balance grabbing more work hours and more class time.
business managers do not respond to student TA a lot.
University parking is extremely expensive for employees and students
low salary and no commuting compensation.
Not any downsides for now
No. issue as such USC Employee policy are pretty good,
The job is restricted to grant funding
Not much, it was a regular job so there was nothing bad.
-A lot of miscommunication between departments -Stressful at time due to being short staffed
I wish the pay was higher and we can learn new skills.
Human Resources Division is totally corrupt. If you don't go along with their leadership, they'll attempt to destroy you. Questionable management of complaints to say the least. Scandal city. They will do very little to support you unless you're a senior executive. Everyone else is disposable and subject to abuse at random.
There are too many parties?
Pay is low but standard
Wage is too low and cannot cover living expenses
Sometimes difficult administration, especially the bureaucratic side. Covid was completely disruptive but obviously don't hold that against them.
Its difficult to get promotions.
Low pay for the Los Angeles region
Not great leadership, can be toxic work environment.
large, not very innovative, can be disconnected internally
Sometimes difficult administration, especially the bureaucratic side. Covid was completely disruptive but obviously don't hold that against them.
Its difficult to get promotions.
Expensive area, and they disliked providing food for seminars, events, etc. Also, the campus made happy hours illegal. All alcohol had to be catered by the university, which was a crazy rule.
Low pay for the Los Angeles region
the pay is kind of lower
Very independent, not much direction
Pay is not very high
HR management and Business Office management are inefficient and bloated. They need to use kaizen principles to streamline their processes.
Because of remote work, it's hard to receive the training and attention necessary when issues arise.
Nearly impossible to be promoted as staff member with in the same role; you either have to leave to apply to a new position elsewhere OR they need to create a new position within your department that you apply for (often work you are already doing)
You miss students when they graduate.
Bad management and bad PI
None in particular, enjoyed work
I did not have any negative experiences.
Days can get repetitive at times
Not great leadership, can be toxic work environment.
It might take a while to get on board and necessary access to perform job duties.
large, not very innovative, can be disconnected internally
Not competitive pay need more money

Low pay High workload Hostile environment
Must pay for parking. Not all USC offices are convenient to taking public transportation.
Low pay and everything is slow
My cons apply to all of higher education institutions.
None in particular, enjoyed work
Getting paid a little is nice to supplement student loans if you're a masters student, but clearly not a liveable wage
I did not have any negative experiences.
There are no cons for this.
Lazy Co-workers usually cause problems and cant be fired.
I cannot think of anything negative
Some lab procedures can be a little strict but nothing too crazy.
not great, but good benefits
extra work nee to be done
the department i am in does not have much career growth / not my particular field
Limited growth opportunity within the same department.
Not a lot of opportunity to move up unless someone leaves and does not offer hybrid roles in this field.
Sometimes the work is too little and you could take on tasks that require 0 brainpower but this could be a pro for some people and occasional short design deadlines.
None none none none none
There is lots of red tape
Inconsistent work with client work but lots of room to grow skills in leadership and management
limit of 20hrs max for students
Sometimes can be mundane during Summer time.
boring, can be tedious, limited hours a week
You have to pay $100 a month for parking, there is not room for salary increase, HR is impossible to talk to
Continuous missing paychecks !!! Some for a over an month, extending to 2 months…no one cared. Had to sacrifice during COVID -19 to ensure the safety of ALL and was taken advantage of. Anyone who could have helped did not give a flying you know what as those who worked through a scary time period struggled to pay rent, car payment, basic necessities for children, and get to the actual job itself !!! Let’s not even get started on work conditions.. here’s an small one.. Even with knowledge of old age, disabilities or injuries, still had to stand for hours, with chairs literally taken away to “guarantee” no sitting which was not included in the job description. Oh let’s not forget the “how” in founding out the company let me go.. in the university newspaper …. The same exact time it went public… no notice .. well I guess except for that!!!!!! As eyes from all over and I mean ALL eyes looked upon reading with pity a few laughing.. because I lost my job in a article announcement during the middle of a shift. It’s with great displeasure that this place that’s looked at as an “staple” to LA is complete and utterly beautiful catfishing trash.
A professor tried to push work they agreed to do onto me urgently in the middle of the night.
None truly, everyone is the best
nothing I can think of.
salary is kinda low considering what i am contributing
There are no cons for this.
Lazy Co-workers usually cause problems and cant be fired.
I cannot think of anything negative
Some lab procedures can be a little strict but nothing too crazy.
Leadership is money driven, plain and simple
The opener in certain departments is a double edge sword. Hard to find the structure that allows you efficiently ho about your job.
Nothing , low pay, lot of work
Bureaucracy, limited growth opportunities if you’re not faculty, parking
There is lots of red tape
Inconsistent work with client work but lots of room to grow skills in leadership and management
USC Keck campus (HSC) is separate from the main UPC campus. HSC is missing the inspirational collegiate atmosphere that UPC has.
No real cons to be honest.
Large Institution can be hard to navigate at times.
limit of 20hrs max for students
low salary, long working hours
Pay is not the best

Pay seems low compared to others
you could be very busy during final time
No cons at this time.
It's depending on the manager because of some them are good
After two years of being on a team of designers that did a lot of great work, work that was highly reviewed by our superiors and THEIR superiors as well, I and my fellow designers were suddenly told that we'd be reduced from full-time employees to part-time, making less than half of what we made before the change. USC's rationale behind this decision was that they ""didn't have enough money to keep us all on full time"" and had decided to outsource half our work to a company overseas that would do it for cheap. Again: myself and my fellow designers did nothing wrong, and had been told several times how much we and the level of our work were/was appreciated... And yet we promptly were told that we either accept a reduced position with reduced salary or we quit altogether. I don't for a second believe the rationale given for the change: that USC, of all places/institutions/universities, was low on money. I and the others affected 110% do NOT believe that excuse. What I and my coworkers DO believe is that USC saw an opportunity to outsource jobs we'd worked hard at and were dedicated to doing well just to save a buck. Just to save a salary or two or three and send our jobs elsewhere rather than look after their hardworking employees or reflect, in kind, the dedication and loyalty we had given them.
Lack of organization in the department
Only cons were self-imposed because of my own lack of time management at times.
Let too many good people walk away by not addressing pay issues.
None that I can think of...
Starting on my first day, I was immediately yelled at in my face by someone I was working with. There is no training whatsoever, but they expect you to know everything right off the bat. Luckily, working in sales taught me how to wing it and remain confident, but unfortunately I experienced harassment by a person I was working with. I am shocked by the amount of weird, creepy politics that go on here. This position reminded me why so many people are fighting for hybrid/remote work because there are people in this world that just get a thrill of giving others a hard time. Manipulation and intimidation management style no longer work in this evolving society. I am so disappointed and honestly quite sad at how things turned out here. I hope that no other innocent person eager to work here will have the same experience as I did.

If you promote the business in everything you do and look past the inappropriate interactions happening daily (often enabled by the C-suite men themselves), you can manage to have a positive experience with the company If you feed into the company culture and/or are attractive, you can likely see career growth if that's how you want to achieve it

","- Not much room for growth, raises, etc.
I read reviews in the past this job can cause divorce! They didn't lie! My husband was never home and I ended up feeling alone all the time! We're now divorced! Great job NCR at destroying a family with 4 kids! Now they have no dad! Appreciate you! Really!
- Going through company split - Market was tough
Work Life balance on the low side
One bad manager and you’re unemployed, no loyalty for decades of dedication. Ethics means nothing to management, they hire all their buddies, most managers have never done the role they manage. Toxic coworkers who lie and backstab to get ahead or save their jobs. Company is currently going to split, management has told nobody nothing and has been laying off any job that can be done in Serbia remotely, now over 10,000 employees in Serbia, run away from this mess, what once was a good company 20 years ago has been destroyed, every good thing is gone, as an employee you will be ask to bend over backwards, work weekends, night shift, and holidays, at the end of the year you get either no pay raise, maybe 1%, and a Walmart gift card for $25…..
Lots of travel, and rotating ""On call"". Very little opportunity for growth.
Very poor career pathing and personal growth strategies; work live balance is sub standard more heavily weighted to the work than the life unfortunately; nepotism rears its ugly head more than it should
Salaries are below range and aren't competitive (I do hope that changes in the future) for the benefit of the company. Many people are leaving for better opportunities and that leaves less people to train the new members, therefore making onboarding difficult.
Not a lot of career development
Management was a bit out of touch with KPIs
Data is wildly inaccurate and has not been fixed for years. You will be under paid. The sales enablement leader Cyndi seems to be a sales impending leader. Our sales process is the worst I have ever seen. The implementation team dictates the sales process and all sales managers and IC’s are frustrated. I really would stay away If I were you. It is really a horrible place to work right now.
Weekend rotations, minimal pay raises even when company is posting huge profits quarter after quarter. Unknown future due to company split. Minimal communication about employees future after split. No choice given as to what company you will work for after split.
Lots of travel, and rotating ""On call"". Very little opportunity for growth.

Slow growth and pay progress for less senior employees.
Extremely Poor leadership at that top. No opportunity for senior advancement.
Just a weird culture really.
Many changes due to market conditions which is producing some instability
They don't pay OT. I worked a rotating 8 day work week and they never paid. Management only cares about numbers. Training is lacking.
Very little training and unrealistic quotas. Especially when the entire company isn't hitting their quota for the year. Will put employees into positions they don't want to be moved to, but have no choice if they want to keep their jobs with NO training at all and then will lay them off if they aren't performing the way they want within the first 4 months of being in that position. Even though, people in that same position for almost 1 year are getting by with no sales, either. Interesting.
Execs spout a lot of platitudes while lining their own pockets at the expense of the regular employee; middle managers have little management skill and focus most on what will advance their own career. No mentoring or development of employees. You better know what to do to succeed. Forget Bonuses or pay increases if they need to buy another company or gives bonuses to the execs.
Poor communication between departments. Low pay
salaries non competitive lack of company direction poor leadership
Business processes seem behind other companies.
Mandating employees 3 days on-site. Least raise and promotions. Only people with personal connections get promoted the most.
Long days and time off is always rotating, meaning: you have no set calendar days off only, you work x number of days then get time off….. if not requested to work overtime.
They offer a low salary with respect to other companies.
nothing to say. duh. if you like working, apply.

Can have long hours and some weekend work.
Work ife baance is not the gratest. Shift have ypu gone 10 plus hours a day. With 2 hour of the 10 unpaid.
I do not have any complaints
Inconsistent scheduling Usually working holidays On call first week every month on day off Overtime happens often Scheduled for overnight work without notice
Average salary. International teams are sometimes difficult to collaborate with when there are issues, tight deadlines, etc.
Nothing at this time that i am aware of.
Pay is a little on the low side for some jobs.
Splitting into two companies creates uncertainities
- Meh benefits - Forced to work in office but some teams don't have designating seating. Whats the point? - I was presented with very misleading expectations in my interview. - Toxic work culture that goes completely unchecked (especially if its senior person). - Way too much team overhead to get anything worthwhile done - Lacluster product and tech stack.
Increased market cost are impacting coverage options.
Not enough pay and pushy territory manager.
Upper management does not care about techs and changes shifts and requirements often.
Can have long hours and some weekend work.
* Compensation. Apparently, there is a great pay disparity between NCR software developers and the rest of the world. After being laid off by NCR, I was hired on by my next employer for 50% more money! * Disconnect between upper mgmt and the worker bees. Company-wide virtual meetings with the Executive Leadership Team are intended to bridge the gap and show how in-touch they are with everyone, but they only serve to prove the opposite. These clowns are up there putting lipstick on a pig, all the while laughing and carrying on as if the rest of the company is too stupid to realize what a shithole they've dug for us.
Low pay, penny raises, horrible schedules with no flexibility. I was happy to leave and they didn’t even care that I did. Good riddance
Constantly expecting ""Do more with less"" as they lay off multiple employees multiple times a year in order to meet shareholder expectations. Very little room for career growth in US due to most non-programming positions being moved over seas. Always at risk of a RIF (Reduction In Force) regardless of performance or tenure.
Getting promoted is easy if you are a university hire or former intern. Otherwise, you will only get promoted if you have a good manager, which is hard to find! It doesn't matter if you have been in the workforce for 20+ years. You are only paid for what you can list in your goals. That being said, goals are written half way through the year, so not sure it is a true measure.
Hiring and firing is based off of buddy system. No communication between departments. No one in management is on the same page. Some management are in the position and have never done the job they are managing a department for. You will be paid the lowest wage they can pay you to perform two different job titles at one time
Cliquish culture, unqualified ppl promoted, low pay compared to other tech companies.
- Every technology I learnt is owned and used only by NCR, so no transferable skills when it comes to tech stack - Lots of organization changes, got moved around to different managers often - Extensive workload every other week - Training process could be better, lots of learning from trial and error - Outdated tech stack and faulty software - Basically three jobs in one: project manager, configurator, and trainer
Work ife baance is not the gratest. Shift have ypu gone 10 plus hours a day. With 2 hour of the 10 unpaid.
No downsides experienced. Had great time
Digital Banking had to constrain budgets for the better of the entire company. Caused the roadmap to delay in delivery
Not enough pay and pushy territory manager.
Upper management does not care about techs and changes shifts and requirements often.
Out of touch management/leadership Office politics that determine your career growth Culture that encourages drinking and is exclusive to those of us who don't want to drink with their coworkers; however, if you're willing to keep your head down and party at bars/clubs with your managers, you will likely see career growth (though unrelated to your technical skillset) Expect nepotism: interns with no experience that somehow happen to be related to the C-suite, ""senior"" managers that got hired from their parents' referrals, and position powergrabs during reorgs that are unchecked and overlooked due to nepotism or favoritism
-Difficult growth -Changes within company and management does not benefit the CE's -Recent dispatchers do not communicate well and will not coordinate calls accordingly to areas close to you (they would rather go one place then far away the next then backtrack again) -Not given enough time to complete required training

Constant pressure, little reward or appreciation from higher ups
Low wages no bonus almost impossible to earn increase in pay or monetary recognition
Same as any large corporation
Lots of cons. Poor management and executives. Management wants you to give 110% but only pay you 80%. Always blaming the services side of the business for the companies down fall but they sign crazy contracts with unreasonable SLA's. Business acumen extends both ways. If you want someone to give you a 110% you pay them 110%. If not, you get what you pay for and that's why there is such a high turn over rate. They higher people with. I experience at a higher pay rate than some folks who have been here 10+ years. Then expect them more tenor people to train them.
It's a global company, so sometimes you may be asked to meet outside of regular business hours (not by folks within UX team though).
OT cuts, Availability, and lot's of corporate shifts.
Long hours, low pay, bad work life balance. My boss told me he expects me to work at least 9 hours a day
Training and documentation, Too many meetings, hinder productivity.
Tough to move up organizationally
Poor pay for the amount of responsibility, job requirements, Inadequate training and support to perform job duties without assistance. Dangerous at times. 100% chance you will eventually be robbed while working. Small annual raises in the 1-3% range. Small (if any) bonuses for non management employees. Zero cost of living increases during time worked even through record inflation.
Work 365 days a year, will work 7-12 days straight at times without OT pay due to the way NCR cuts off the pay week. Long hours (9 hour shifts, you get an hour lunch but it's hard to take those) poor leadership
Onboarding is disorganized, new hires are left in the dark. Support structure is ad hoc at best. Documentation is difficult to find and is spread across many different websites. Even top performing employees are criticized for issues outside of our control. Pay raises don't even keep pace with inflation. Many people are effectively making less today than 2-3 years ago. Zero opportunity for advancement.
Almost everything the benefits are expensive the fact that I don't have holidays off, can't take holidays off also the fact that I can't use my vacation as I see fit or my floating holidays, when I need to and there pay scale is a joke especially if you have been employed for mor then 5years, and being forced to work one side the house that your NOT comfortable with .
-great for starting out, stagnant for senior level workers
Lack of career development opportunities.
Good systems are not in place, we seem to re-invent the wheel with every account. Training was minimal with no follow up.
If you aren't part of the ""Good Ole Boys"" you'll be given low pay and more work.
Digital Banking had to constrain budgets for the better of the entire company. Caused the roadmap to delay in delivery
Pay is not competitive. No direction and lack of communication
Work-life balance is not great
It’s a relatively big organization and things move slowly
Stagnancy, Detached Management, Disorganized, Slow Raises
Lack of employee development, they make promises they don’t keep. Hard work, loyalty and good performance don’t matter. A couple of times a year they just cut heads and it will eventually happen to you.
People in management positions who don’t have a clue trying to run territories, pay is terrible, dispatch is in Serbia
Low wages no bonus almost impossible to earn increase in pay or monetary recognition
Same as any large corporation
On call rotation Install work
When it was bad it was because management was not open or available, stressed, only able to manage the work and not the people, projects were under-resourced, and teams were toxic. Work life balance did not exist, bias was prevalent, and any type of support was non-existent unless you belonged to certain demographic groups.

Great workplace to be in
• I suppose a pro could be the possibility of working on many different projects; however, there aren't any projects to work on. • Opportunity to work with a diverse group of individuals
nice place to work in
Amazing supervisors and staff Great team project
Great Clients, great teams, lots of support for diversity and ERG's, and saalar/beenfits to match.

Decent work-life balance and growth opportunities

90% of the people I have worked with day to day are very pleasant and have made some lasting friendships here. Lots of different tech stacks Tons of brands to work with Benefits are decent
None except a good salary
One of the best cultures of any company I've ever worked for. Strong strategic leadership. Fantastic talent pool.
Smart folks all around to work with and learn from
Met some amazing people outside of my project (tend to only have bad experience with upper management). Unlimited PTO is also great, and people usually never have a problem getting approved.
Good salary and work life balance
The people here are incredibly smart, collaborative and want to help others! Consulting is hard and some clients are tough but our internal teams are tight and focused on client outcomes, professional growth opportunities and the ability to move around internally which creates great options for long term tenure!

friendly employees organized workflow great management
Work Flexibility (You can work anywhere) - If you prefer a social environment (The office is an open layout) If you want to be in an office but want to focus (Private Pods) Home They really work on providing a holistic culture - Team events, inclusion groups, etc. Weekly 1:1's with your manager (Although, I feel like that's become a standard in many companies) Interesting work with big-name companies in various industries (McDonald's, Citibank, Marriott, etc.)
Love the culture. I work in the salesforce practice as a Sr Consultant.
Exposure to different projects, cloud envs and industries
Great people, variety of accounts to work on.
Tier two consulting firm with growth opportunities. You have to have a good network within the firm to get on good project. WLB is good. Comp is good. Not very stable as they've already had some lay offs.
Flexible work hours Health and wellness of employees matter High support for growth
- Big Projects for lots of experience - Training Paid for - Good coworkers, but highly depends on your area of work - Beautiful big offices in corporate cities (but if you're not in one of those cities, then you're at a loss) - Good if you enter at a high salary (top management/architect/project managers don't have to work or try very hard but walk away with fat salaries) - Great insurance
Work life balance is good
culture, pace of environment, friendly coworkers
Good work life balance ONLY on some projects
Great place to work and learn. Get to work with clients from around the world.
Tend to pay above average to compensate for the political climate. If you are given an offer feels too good to be true and there might be a catch, see below.

Good benefits, opportunity to work with large clients
At this point I cannot thing of any pros
PS has a strong footprint across its ""Groupe"" agencies - in fact, there are over 400 agencies that have various services for Accounts across the globe. The agencies provide coverage and are intended to avoid conflicts of interest between servicing competing brands.

Great work life balance, if you set boundaries. Good for people who don't need or like a lot of guidance and want to make their own way.

Knowledgeable team and good work experience

Best place to work. You will be up to date with the technologies . Anyone can reach higher management if you have any concerns.

","Nothing much to mention currently.
No downsides at all here
• The Bench is where great people go to die. I was on the bench (when employees cycle off of a project and another hasn't started yet, it's referred to as the bench) for eight weeks, and I, along with a few dozen more bench people, was let go. There's just no work coming into the organization. • What work there is with large clients, the senior employees get first dibs. You will not get to work on big client projects if you're new. • Being a consultancy, your job is 100% dependent on the sales team(s); unfortunately, they're a disaster. Product, too, but we'll get to that later. In eight weeks, I worked on three pitch decks, and they were all pitifully executed. One hundred twenty pages of a PPT deck, minimum. • The product team couldn't have been more toxic.
nothing is hurting me at this point in time
No cons that I experiences while working here
Company is very large and you can feel lost
Not always great communication between executive sponsors of projects and internship program directors
No cons from my 1 year experience
Too sales-centric and not driven to deliver quality
Most things honestly...Treated with no respect, no chance of growing at the company or learning at it. Felt like i was being used and kept there with false hope of growing within the company given by managers. No help from upper management and it was every person for themselves.
Not guaranteed a return offer
Underpaid for the industry but with decent opportunities for fast advancement.
Compensations should be higher. I'm more senior than some of the other employees but I make less than them
Pay isn't as good as some other tech companies.
Low pay for role/experience Little chance for upward movement past senior Poor communication from leadership No clear direction the company is steering (say one thing to employees, another to leadership, another to media) Survival of the fittest mentality Lack of guidance/support
Where to begin? So many cons. I was bullied by a higher up in my first week of employment. No one wanted to believe me, including HR, because the bully had been there a long time, and I was a new employee. However, I learned that she was bullying others beneath her, and not just me. HR was a joke when we had a meeting to confront the issue. The bully lied in front of HR about our exchange. Too many disparate systems to learn at once. There was no centralized system to organize all data and employee information. I was pulled out of orientation on an emergency project, and was left hanging to figure everything out on my own after missing the rest of orientation. My boss and group changed within 2 weeks of employment, and I was placed into a group that made zero sense for my role. I quit after a mere few weeks of employment.
Not terribly good on standardizing a reliable delivery methodology to achieve reliable cost to value across teams.
Tight schedule, moving targets, always on your toes
Work life balance is completely dependent on the project you are on. My current team is working weekend and holidays, and had something to say when I did not respond to pings and emails at night. The offshore team is frequently working into the am (easily 16 hours day). That is not okay AT ALL! The whole offshore team is burnt out and they are being used as an example as to why I should be responsive to emails and pings outside of work hours. My days usually start at 7/8 am to accommodate the offshore team, but end late because client is in a later time zone. I am already working over 8 hours on most days and I am still expected to work in additional to that. Upper management literally works 24/7 and expects the same from the team. The experience is horrible for people in the early career program. People are either put in projects without ever being billable (they would be told they will become billable after x amount of time). Others are on the bench for months without any updates. Promotion is also dependent on billable hours… All this is happening and the company doesn’t even pay that well. The experience you have is a gamble. I have heard some great projects and some really horrible ones, so take your bet Also don’t get me started on the mess of the internal structure. Trying to get a hold of your staffing partner or HR is… good luck :) some people aren’t even assigned a manager/staffing partner for months after joining the company
They could not find me a project in 4 months. Once they did , client wanted me to move from east coast to west which was not possible. I had to go back to my previous job eventually.
It's a large, matrixed organization and can take some time to push things through.
Client can change everything, been stuck on poorly managed client for years and sapient manager that is also on client barely speaks to me
not too much work to do
Nothing at all in my opinion
no cons work hours are okay
Benefits could use an adjustment
More structure and accountability needed from management
1. There is a scarcity mindset in upper management. Managers and architects are constantly trying to take responsibility and sabotage your career. 2. Sneaky dirty politics. 3. Very low pay compared to other firms. Delivery focused work. You will barely have real product management or strategy conversations. 4. At times, toxic work culture and aggressive environment. 5. The folks on green cards/work visas are overworked and bring an unneeded competitive, lack of collaboration, and toxic work culture to the company. 6. Overworking is seen as a badge of honor. 7. Leadership has poor manners and basic etiquettes. If you’re American, it will be hard to adjust to the culture of interruptions, weird humor, and lack of courtesy.
My time at this company was plagued by toxic leadership, racial biases and only flavor offshore, and an overall disarrayed internal structure. As someone early in their career, I had hoped for growth and learning opportunities, but instead, I found myself on the bench for months without any meaningful work. Trying to reach out to HR or a staffing partner was an exercise in futility. If you value a supportive environment and career development, I would advise considering other options.
Lots of similar types of work
not that I can think of
Project Hours vs. Bench - They budget a certain number of hours each week for you. This means you have to either - Meet your hourly allotment (Rare) - Haul a** so you don't go over (Frequent) - Not count the actual hours you worked (Most Common) You are constantly working with different people. It's a crapshoot for whether you have a great (organized and...normal) group of people, or try to have as few interactions as possible Lots of last-minute (and I mean LAST minute) requests- There were times I would get an email at 8pm that something needed to be done by 8am the next day. It's not optional - You just do it. Even if you're up till 2am going back and forth with your team member. I was a part of the 2nd round of layoffs that happened shortly after COVID. By the time that happened, almost all of the interesting and insightful people had jumped ship. I was actually relieved when they let me go.
Slow growth. Requires time in title even if you’re ready for a promotion.
Too much work and also consulting gigs are not something I enjoy a lot
Potential to be stagnant with work for times.
Good projects are given to those with tenure. This is a male dominated firm, not female friendly If you are not favored, you will be on bench and then eventually let go
Ive only been here a short time so I haven’t found anything bad so far
- Very bad at mergers/acquisitions, any sense of company culture was lost (at the company where I worked that was acquired) - Lost office basics, such as snacks, drinks, anything except for a espresso machine, and eventually lost the office space all together shortly after I left the company - Unless you're at the top of your company when acquired, you will become irrelevant and disposable to the company as a whole. The role hierarchy realignment tore up our company and put almost everyone but top management near the bottom of the org chart - Very bad evaluation/raise structures, basically capped everyone at my company at about 5% salary increases year-to-year -
Clients can be demanding without billing extra hours
salary not as competitive as other companies
Lot of politics in getting promotion It takes years and years to get promoted or recognition Need to always beg for hike or promotion though everyone knows you are critical for the project Totally tired and discouraged,I feel the company doesn't recognize people who are smart, they only recognize people who always be a yes boss to managers and directors. They have unlimited vacation just in paper and you can't take more than 3 weeks of vacation continuously. Waiting for the day something changes
More focus and direction from upper management.
No Job Security and lack of projects Very different in culture to other agencies, more authoritarian, no empathy or admitting mistakes where its obvious. It is perceived as a sign of weakness. If you are that kind of leader who isnt afraid to be empathetic or admit your mistakes, you will struggle here. If you are authoritarian man with big ego, you are destined to thrive. Lack of projects creates toxic culture where people dont collaborate and are very territorial. Add on top recent layoffs makes environment even more toxic. Women are invisible in leadership, 98% of mid-level folks and above are male.
Toxic leadership. Micromanaging and expect you to work crazy hours. Management consulting team is especially bad. The leadership team runs you to the ground and gaslights performance. Career progression is very bureaucratic and subjective.
Smaller pool of clients compared to larger consulting companies
Sometime the content and companies we research for aren't the most exciting.
Slow. Boring. Not challenging work.
Sometimes the company can be a little disorganized. It feels like it's not the creme of the crop, but we do get the work done.
To many titles and hierarchies.
Few projects High turnover: Publicis Sapient is known for its intense work environment, and some employees may find it challenging to maintain a work-life balance. This can lead to high turnover rates, which can impact the quality of the services provided.
More focus and direction from upper management.
Promotion process is literally IMPOSSIBLE for senior manager and above
Smaller pool of clients compared to larger consulting companies
Sometime the content and companies we research for aren't the most exciting.
Toxic work culture, Racism & Descrimination
Slow. Boring. Not challenging work.
Only a laptop was provided. No docking station, monitors, cell phone allowance, etc. Target bonus was not paid even though strong individual and company performance and minimal bench time. It's a consulting company - they were quick to lay me off after project completion to avoid any significant bench time.
Sometimes the company can be a little disorganized. It feels like it's not the creme of the crop, but we do get the work done.
No work life balance. Management acts sneaky with lip service on diversity and inclusion
Micro managing directors that make it hard for you to do your job
Competing agencies will actively undermine each other to capture larger portions of revenue. There is no semblance of strategy between agencies because recommendations are fought over based on differing P&Ls. The client is often unaware and left holding the bag once budgets are exhausted.
Most of the work is done remotely, and may not be for everyone
Employee retention - paying their employees a competitive salary that stays competitive or up to date in comparison to market/competitors.
Cons is amount of work required.
Pay equality, various promotion blockers
Not as many projects to go around lately Many people on the bench currently
Client matters you do not
Too many people on the bench, not enough projects
Some projects can be boring
Team disconnect since each one member might be working under different sub projects even if they are in the same team
None here for me. The team offers great learning opportunities, regular feedback and review, and having a People Manager to solely focus on your own personal growth is great.
None so far, great company!
No cons. Would love to work there again someday!
Not a lot of help in career growth at least for internal teams.
You choose your own path by forming relationship and getting into the right projects. you have to work hard to get promoted because there are so many smart people around.
You may get stuck on a project for a long time
Career growth Salary Management decision HR policies
Not much ! Pros weigh high than cons !!
Without correct positioning you can get stuck on less exciting projects Almost fully remote nature of US work can restrict team building and company culture
Very big, diverse company that does a bit of everything that's trying to do everything. There will be confusion, disorganization, and inconsistency. That's the problem when your culture is all about moon shots. Sometimes rockets fall back to the sea.
Lack of technical and personal growth
such a large company can be tough at time to connect or gain direction or assimilate to the culture
- A lot of hierarchy - Not much growth
Achieving buy-in, consistency and focus (on architecture, tech stack, processes, etc.) across a global community can be hard at times.
Not as many projects to go around lately Many people on the bench currently
- Leadership can sometimes feel absent
Work may not be consistent as this is a project based company
Path to growth and promotion are somewhat obscure.
Client matters you do not
N/A - PS is an amazing place to work with people who genuinely feel like family.
Sometimes can spend a long time on the bench
Not a great place to grow
Lack of technical and personal growth
such a large company can be tough at time to connect or gain direction or assimilate to the culture
No vision for tech folks. Only senior management director above can take decisions in hikes, poor benefits.

","They Changed management a lot
Understaffed occasionally, but it's not too big of an issue.
Sometimes we can be short staffed Lack of ability for pay increase
job never started and the position was not available anymore in that location staff inform me about the change.
It's a lot of work to maintain a high client load
Managers are too busy to check on workers
guests were entitles and rude
Constantly asked to take more shifts
- horrible work/life balance - management is careless and hands-off to the point where it’s a burden - very corporate feel - members are very often entitled and rude - Upper level management does not appreciate anyone - Upper level management doesn’t connect or get to know part-time team members - Liars and cheaters get their way and work to the top - Honesty is punished - Team not appreciated at all - Employees dramatically underpaid - Corporate only cares about profits
Low pay but room for growth
Misogynistic managers, and no room for growth, mangers protect workers that were sexually harassing fellow employees and never followed the rules and standards set for other employees. Upper management had inappropriate relationships with fellow employees.
none I can think of
This company values money above all else. They will always side with members over employees even if they are in the members are lying. They pay minimum wage and expect a lot in return. They often ignore the rules (ie, asking me to take children under 4 in a class when the age is clearly stated in all of the training and then claiming bad attitude when I refused). Also often ignore the fire regulations for number of people allowed in workout classes just so they don't get complaints and to keep members (aka customers) happy. Not interested in trying to keep long time employees-no pay raise for the last 4 years and when minimum wage went up, previous pay raises did not get included so was on the same pay as new employees even after 5 years of service.
It could be considered very exclusive
Management can be a pain
Terrible management, rude members, and your coworkers will snitch on you even for the smallest thing to make themselves look better (sometimes). When you get hired your managers are super friendly and outgoing if you have any problems, but once you worked for a few weeks down the line all that slowly fades away and it becomes harder to get a hold of your managers. I even had my manager ghost me for 3 days. The higher ups only care about themselves and compete against each other to be at a better position. Also, Lifetime doesn't have a scholarship program for their student employees.. which is ridiculous because this company is charging so much money from their members.
working at the same place you workout at
Not a lot of coworker vetting- some people don't pull their weight and a lot of managers would just let it slide. Experience per shift is very manager dependent- there were a few that I loved, but most of them were uptight and made me feel paranoid while doing my job. Kids can be a lot. Know that even seemingly short 4hr shifts will be exhausting some days and you will be expected to wear a smile on your face regardless.
Poor management took over clients can be high maintenance
Not enough hours for a swim instructor.
Weird commission structure and no marketing from company themselves.
The Culture of this company has taken a major hit in the past few years, and it is pretty toxic culture now. The company executives don't care about the employees, only stock prices. Employees continually bring up grievances, but executives do little or nothing to address them. The benefits are abysmal for a company whose slogan is the ""Healthy Way of Life"". No 401(k) match. Maternity leave was just implemented in 2023, and it includes only 8 weeks of leave for the 'birthing' parent'. It does not apply to adoption or surrogacy. If your partner qualifies for health care elsewhere, your parter cannot be on your health plan. This year, less than a week before Juneteenth, the company rescinded the Holiday as a corporate holiday, requiring people to use PTO last minute instead. Most DEI initiatives seem to have disappeared, along with the recruiting department. Employees have been told numerous times that it is a 'recording breaking year', but the company silently discontinued their merit increase program and didn't pay out bonuses. No announcements were made about compensation.
Inflexible schedule, management has no direction, promises education but fails to deliver, expected “market” yourself in the facility unpaid
none! loved working for this company
Not for buns who don’t want to work
Sometimes parents can be difficult Head coach takes on a lot
Communication and lack of follow through
Scheduling could be inconsistent sometimes.
not enough paid or excused time off
Low pay for employees in Aquatics
Pay is very low compared to other like positions around
working at the same place you workout at
Poor management took over clients can be high maintenance
low payment rate .never increase your payments
Not enough hours for a swim instructor.
Weird commission structure and no marketing from company themselves.
High turnover of team members in the operations department, always felt understaffed.
So many changes. Sexual harassment is an issue. Spend a lot of money on uniforms and poor discount in cafe
none! loved working for this company
Very sales oriented, high competition
No cons that I can think of.
They hire so many temps and hardly keep anyone permanently. Like to always throw the temps on the hardest jobs and then lay you off!
poor management, lack of creative freedom
Low pay for the type of work, poor management
Does not pay its employees enough
None that I can think of.
Management is extremely unorganized and unfocused on helping the team. This is an issue that stems all the way up the the general manager of the club and all the way down to assistant managers of the training department.
difficult management, too many rules and most employees don't follow
Pay is very low compared to other like positions around
The pay could have been better
Management is okay. Could be better.
Life time expects way more out of their instructor performers than other clubs.

extremely busy during the summer
Ok management, not great pay, very stressful, shifts feel long, burnout is inevitable, and expects a lot for seemingly little pay.
Disorganized management, lower pay than workload
Pay rate is not fair and doesn't give liveable wages. Even when you negotiate and have experience they are heck bent to pay you the lowest starting pay and pull off 'we can revisit salary increase with some months of experience'.
Low pay, weird boss, have to dress business professional at a gym, boss would not allow sitting during 8 hour long shifts
Crazy messes, Guests are entitled to their money's worth.
They lie and tell you it's so busy when it's dead. They ask if you are a people person because they expect you to promote yourself on your down time, which is fine. I asked specifically of there were clients booking or it was going to be me looking for clients and the answer was oh there are plenty of clients, that is why we are hiring, we turn away clients because we don't have enough estheticians to book them with. We just want to make sure we see our staff being active on their down times so we want you to go around and talk to members, introduce yourself give out your cards etc. They tell you it's commission based on tier salary and say it's alot to explain but don't worry you'll be so busy you'll make top commission regardless, then when you start working you find out tiers means you don't make commission until you make a certain amount of money EVERYDAY! And if you go under that tier one day, you're done for the whole week. Back down the tier to nothing once again. They don't tell you either that your commissions are based on monthly sales. It's not busy, your base pay is min wage $15 an hour, so you are basically being paid to walk around and hand out your cards to members that are working out? Lounging at the pool? They always have a help wanted posted both Garden city and Syosset. Now I know why!
The job did not pay enough for the work given.
Felt like I was a janitor cleaning bathrooms
Lots of labor for operation.
None that I can think of.
They had 3 days PTO, took away bonuses, cut hours, and you had to beg and plead in order to get a pay raise.
difficult management, too many rules and most employees don't follow
- underpaid - would sometimes be scheduled for on call?
Be wary of management, hit or miss. Also corporate felt like they were on a different planet
I had a terrible manager that set me up for failure.
You pay for the training instead of getting paid for it. At work, you don't do anything related to what your training was for. After more than a month from interview and on boarding, they give you a 2 hours weekly shift. I'll work without payment for 6 weeks before I finally recover what I paid for the training.
The pay could have been better
Management is okay. Could be better.
Some days are fast paced, others are slow
Life time expects way more out of their instructor performers than other clubs.
It wasn't always easy to communicate with management.
Management is garbage. Complete disconnect from front line workers. Schedule is inconsistent so no work-life balance. Management, at least at my location is extremely dramatic and toxic. Have asked for change before, with nothing ever coming from the pleas. All the managers are friends so no one is held accountable for their poor management skills.
Salary, Hours, Benefits, Training, Team Environment, Management Support
I have yet to find something negative about working at Life Time. I enjoy coming to work every day.
Cleaning required by personal trainers in a very large gym
- Hours might not be consistent - Depending on current staff, hours could be hard to come by
It can be very overwhelming at times The pay sometimes isn't as good as it should be
Poor leadership. You will do the job of 2 of more people. PTO is a joke. If you are sick, you have to use 1 of your 5 PTO days or 2 sick days. No holiday pay and the only one you are guaranteed off is Christmas. Fast burnout. You are salary and it’s unwritten but the expectation is you’re available 24/7.
little room to grow, interesting culture
very unorganized, constant change in pay for commission, poor bosses
Shady experience with manager over pay, discriminative and aggressive towards you if you have an issue that they deem not worthy of their time, poor managemnt.
extremely busy during the summer
Management could be better as favoritism is involved.
Disorganized management, lower pay than workload
networking in high priority for improving
I never had a problem here

Work life balance and good work environment
The organization is ethical; they will never be late with payments and are flexible with the leaves if you are in good standing with the boss.
Entering the job market with zero professional experience, I found the interview process was adjusted accordingly. I didn't end up working in the skillset I was hired for, but they kicked me off with months of training for a new language and framework before adding me to an engagement directly thereafter using it.

You know your skillset and interests better than anyone else. It's up to you to communicate where you feel your skills are best allocated. Flexible hours depending on your contract, ability to work from home and pick your schedule.

","They are good but they had some second dace also

can't think of any cons
This one is a doozy. So, getting your foot in the door is great, but they will pay you entry level wages no matter what level of work you take on. Their ""annual raises"" are perpetually below inflation levels, so every year you'll actually have less spending power, while at the same time they will give you as much additional work as they can get away with that exceeds what your job actually entails. It should also be noted that as an American, you will have 0 opportunity to progress within the company. I've gone from the helpdesk at my current project to an engineering role, but get paid the same as the helpdesk people that have not advanced at all. They've also refused any pay rate increases for the last 2 years for all employees regardless of their performance, which is also based upon the whims of management in India. They will do things like tie your annual bonus to your completion of random and ""completely voluntary"" tasks without informing you of this.
You will constantly reinterview for your job. In order to get into a project, you have to interview internally with the project team and then with the actual client. Even if there's an open contract to fill, and you can fill it, if anyone in the process doesn't feel you fit, you don't get it. Even if it means you have to help interview the subcontractor to fill the role you can fill. HR is completely unresponsive. Don't ask them for help with anything, they won't even respond. If they do, it's to let you know you reached out to them wrong. I filed a complaint against a coworker for a potentially hostile and abusive workplace and received no reply after over 3 week. I emailed, called my HRBP and submitted an internal grievance and got nothing. Any internal process you need to follow is byzantine at best and Rube Goldbergian as it's standard. If you get instructions on a process, it's usually missing steps or misnamed several times. I went over a year before I was placed under a manager who ever contacted me. Every reporting hierarchy is completely baffling. Just because you can see who reports to whom in the company doesn't mean that's actually how it works.
Less pay compared to other companies. Slow career growth.
Management expecting resources to get business and working for client and then do work for TCS.
Raise/Bonus Structure. Even with an A+ Review, your raise will only be 3-5% barely matching inflation. Career Opportunities are low. Lot of red tapes when it comes to getting any certification in or outside of the company. The values are more talked about then followed.
Management is bit slow and need improve.
salary hike is not up to the market rate
You will be severely underpaid, appraisal for top rating is 1% at senior levels they will entice with bonus. Still, there is a catch of company performance linked with it so even if you work hard there is no guarantee you will get the entire bonus. If you perform well you will get promoted with work responsibility but not the salary. If you stay in this organization for more than 3 years you will be asked to achieve certifications which will be refunded if you pass but if you fail it's out of your pocket and there will be no opportunities to use that skill. It's all to increase the billing from the client. Most probably you will work with an Indian offshore team and which will be full of freshers and being a senior you will be tasked to mentor them and guide them without extra pay. Responsibilities like taking interviews will also be asked without extra pay all in the name of contribution to the project cause. If you are looking for VISA they will do it at the very last moment and without a premium and you will have to handle it all on your own. So please avoid this organization if you have any other options with you.
It took eventually 5 months after my offer before my start date due to COVID-19, but the communication was far and few between across that period. Additionally, after I joined my engagement, I was fully expected to work far beyond capacity to compete my work, working 9 hours on Christmas Eve, a large number of Friday or Saturday nights, taking meetings 12:30am - 2:30am my local time, and got only occasional thank yous from management. It could have just been the culture on my project team, but 60 hours a week at my salary quickly burned me out.

I, along with many others, was unceremoniously laid off from TCS's C&SI unit last week. In the years I've been with the firm, I was constantly reminded how TCS is, at the end of the day, a low-cost Indian IT outsourcing firm run by Indians who, were it not for body shops like TCS, would be completely unemployable. An example of this is the absolutely rampant dishonesty I've both witnessed and have been personally impacted by. One time, I joined a team because the manager straight up lied to me about what I'd be working on -- I was told it would be related to AI/ML and found myself doing basic admin work. In addition to that, I observed a general resistance to committing anything to writing. Whenever I had questions to HR, my emails and messages were almost always flatly ignored. Even with basic day-to-day tasks, I've had teammates, particularly Indians from the ISUs, categorically refuse to communicate by email, preferring everything to be yet another Teams call. This behavior made a lot more sense when I learned about the lawsuit TCS faced from Epic -- it was clear that TCS encouraged people to try to minimize the paper trail that could potentially be subpoenaed, regardless of the interaction. To top it off, these layoffs are happening because there's been yet another global reorg to reverse the reorg the last CEO did last year and, as I just came to learn, C&SI has been a loss leader for a number of years, though you wouldn't know it based on how it was run or what leadership told us. Even the way layoffs were handled is symptomatic of how dysfunctional the company culture is. I was taken off C&SI's payroll and moved into the Resource Management Group because there was no work coming down the C&SI pipeline. I wasn't given any warning that I was about to be laid off at this time. Within 48 hours of being put onto RMG, I was already in the process of getting myself staffed onto billable work, but I was called on Teams by HR at the end of the same workday and informed that TCS made my position redundant and I have been let go. My email and Teams access were both deactivated within a few hours. TCS's/C&SI's HR and IT have made it clear to me from Day 1 that they are not there to help me. For the former, my questions were routinely ignored. For the latter, I submitted support tickets more than once only to just be told that I was doing something wrong (without knowing what) and have my ticket hard closed. If you're coming here looking for any DE&I, you can forget about it. TCS has been sued more than once for giving Indian-born Indians preferential treatment for hiring, staffing, and promotion to the detriment of Americans, including Americans of Indian descent. One time, I referred a woman of Korean descent to my then-manager. We had a call where she had her elevator pitch, and I thought she did really well. Then, when I reminded my manager asking what happened to her application, he told me twice that he ""forgot"". It was then I realized that his team was all either Indian or Caucasian, with nobody of East Asian descent.
salary hike is not up to the market rate
Salary hike is very low.
HR made promises they didn't keep. The pay is extremely low. I had a psychotic team leader who made my life a living hell! To the point I was concerned about my safety. I didn't feel like leadership understood my concerns. The would hire anyone with a pulse who didn't comprehend personal hygiene is a real thing!
Compensation needs to be improved
Bureaucratic Culture: Some employees may find the bureaucratic culture at TCS challenging to navigate, as decisions can be slow and hierarchical.Long working hours: TCS is known for its long working hours, which can be demanding for some employees. High Pressure: TCS is a highly competitive work environment, and employees are often under pressure to meet tight deadlines and high-quality standards. Lack of Innovation: As a large company, TCS may be slower to adapt to new technologies and ideas compared to smaller, more agile competitors. Limited Flexibility: Although TCS offers flexible work arrangements, some employees may find it difficult to negotiate for more flexibility due to the company's policies and culture.
No stock options benefits and insurance is little expensive
Worst onboarding experience ever. I was asked to acknowledge receipt of certain documents before starting and had to push back a half dozen times to get all of the documents. Training is haphazard, painfully slow, and full of wasted time. Communication and coordination are severely lacking within TCS and between TCS and the client with whom I am working. It's my 6th week and I don't even have a badge yet. My compensation is not what I was promised, and when I pointed it out, I was told to talk to my recruiter about a document that I needed to sign. However, that document was signed and sent to the recruiter 2 weeks before my start date. My last paycheck was also shorted because the company freezes the timesheet early in the day on the Friday before payday. My manager attempted to enter an IT ticket to add my hours for that day, but her actions failed. It's been 4 business days, and still no resolution. Systems are extremely slow and have to frequently be restarted or the computer rebooted. The lack of organization and coordination is comical, but I'm not laughing.
Since no layoff, management and policies will turn hostile at times when they want to reduce headcount.
Salary is not up to market standards
Pay is a bit low
No concern for career growth
-this is a staffing company so managers are overwhelmed -there is no mentoring or sense of community -the review process is just going through the motions. Not a real review. -Ultimatix employee software is atrocious
Costly health coverage, no diversity
Few benefits. Low salaries for Sr levels.
System issues have to be worked around and there's mandatory overtime because of high turnover that causes high call volumes.
Hierarchy and checks and balances is crazy - in order to travel you need to get the NA Chairman's approval, it can take 1 month to get a client added to your CRM, just a bunch of steps and processes in the way of doing business efficiently
I don’t see anything in particular
No Growth either financially or otherwise
Some projects can be stressful due to pressing customer needs
The rate and location was changed.
Websites for employee only use are very bugged and difficult to use.
While changing the Projects it not so easy to deal with HR's
Hard to get certifications paid
Terrible pay schedule and advancement plan.
low pay for the work
no growth if stick to one project
There is a lot of bureaucracy
Disorganized so it's difficult to find a project and being onboard.
Disconnect within TCS leadership and staff. Too big company where left hand does not know the right
pay is not that great and most projects are not very interesting and require long hours
Could be a better pay master
Hard to move up- you pretty much stay at the level you were brought in at
Internal Infrastructure not fully developed, Culture almost non-existent, weak support system
They move you to different departments with out talking to you first.
Less Salary, Slow processes, delayed work
Can improve on benefits offered
Contact for annuity customer care is ending and no concrete information is being provided to newer employees
Salary was very less.Salary was very less.Salary was very less.Salary was very less.
Based on the account, tech used can be legacy.
I have not encountered one yet. TCS has been truthful to the contract agreement
Salary range is not as expected
They'll bring you in at Level one title and pay, then at some point put you in as a service desk manager. But they wont train you, change your title or your pay. No opportunity to learn new skills. The sexism and racism here are deplorable. The center manager prides themself in lowballing new hires and bringing them on at an inappropreately low wage. If they say they want to hire you on at (Military insurance company) RUN!! That is the worst possible option.
There is nothing much to talk about Cons.
Average comp, but good learning opportunity
Hierarchical in decision making and employee engagement
Most of the Indian managers from the company are micro managers and doesn’t respect the employees. Almost zero increments.
Low visibility and mobility beyond the account team, at least in the recent years
No severance! You work; get decent rating; continue doing training while trying to work the position your assigned to; you get certifications they say they will reimburse but never do; on bench they request updated resume to send out but never do; they try to get you to move without any kind of relocation package or concern that this is not possible if you also have a home and a spouse working; oh and if you worked all last year and qualified for any type of bonus but get let go prior to bonus not being announced yet...oh, well too bad for you- truly an incentive to work there. Also, I got hired in at one title and pay and never worked that title but continued to get paid at level of that title. It's screwy. FYI max vacation is 10 days no matter what.
You are a resource, plain and simple. It will take a thick skin and a strong will to make a career at TCS. Management does not care about what you think is fair or how you feel about this or that. Save your energy, you are there to do a job. It doesn't matter just do the job they tell you to do and don't make them look bad to the client. Also don't ask for a job description, there probably isn't one and if there is nobody can find it. Low yearly increase, yeah you might get that initial 10 - 30% increase but once you accept your job offer it's 1 - 3% yearly increases for you! Even if you receive stellar reviews from the client and supervisor it doesn't matter. Better pack up and move on or learn a more in demand skill. Benefits nothing to write about. Not too good but not bad. Suffers from big corporate syndrome big time. everything is a long drawn out process. internal resources/ company portal isn't user friendly and hard to navigate, usually requires escalation from your supervisor to gain account access or to get a form approved...if they even can help.

Less pay, more and more work
Nothing bad to comment about tcs
Employees in India get better raises and work life support.
First introduction to company they changed my start date and didn’t tell me for 2 days post. I was frantically trying to get a hold of someone for two days because the position was remote and I didn’t not receive any communication for a portal to log into or anything.
Salary lower compared to big techs. More power to senior managements.
low salary as an expat, might have less support for immigration to USA from India
No management support; 2 one on ones in 3 years; no career path
low salary and no communication
some process are taking time
Good in all their dealings.
Very low salary not matching the market standards, Performance appraisal process not transparent, push to get into sales or leadership roles as you become a senior employee in the organisation
Indian company limits promotion chances
None to mention any cons
Compensation and growth; perks like pension etc
All is good and no nagative
Salary was very less.Salary was very less.Salary was very less.Salary was very less.
* Getting hired took a long time, sometimes ignored for months * You are likely going to be low balled, any other company likely pays more * ""Not Knowing"" is not their problem, it's yours.
Based on the account, tech used can be legacy.
Yearly compensation and hard to get bonus
Low salary. Favoritism exists based on location.
Not so much cons follow
If relocation is a problem for you this may be a “con”.
They'll bring you in at Level one title and pay, then at some point put you in as a service desk manager. But they wont train you, change your title or your pay. No opportunity to learn new skills. The sexism and racism here are deplorable. The center manager prides themself in lowballing new hires and bringing them on at an inappropreately low wage. If they say they want to hire you on at (Military insurance company) RUN!! That is the worst possible option.
Hierarchical in decision making and employee engagement
Most of the Indian managers from the company are micro managers and doesn’t respect the employees. Almost zero increments.
No severance! You work; get decent rating; continue doing training while trying to work the position your assigned to; you get certifications they say they will reimburse but never do; on bench they request updated resume to send out but never do; they try to get you to move without any kind of relocation package or concern that this is not possible if you also have a home and a spouse working; oh and if you worked all last year and qualified for any type of bonus but get let go prior to bonus not being announced yet...oh, well too bad for you- truly an incentive to work there. Also, I got hired in at one title and pay and never worked that title but continued to get paid at level of that title. It's screwy. FYI max vacation is 10 days no matter what.
You are a resource, plain and simple. It will take a thick skin and a strong will to make a career at TCS. Management does not care about what you think is fair or how you feel about this or that. Save your energy, you are there to do a job. It doesn't matter just do the job they tell you to do and don't make them look bad to the client. Also don't ask for a job description, there probably isn't one and if there is nobody can find it. Low yearly increase, yeah you might get that initial 10 - 30% increase but once you accept your job offer it's 1 - 3% yearly increases for you! Even if you receive stellar reviews from the client and supervisor it doesn't matter. Better pack up and move on or learn a more in demand skill. Benefits nothing to write about. Not too good but not bad. Suffers from big corporate syndrome big time. everything is a long drawn out process. internal resources/ company portal isn't user friendly and hard to navigate, usually requires escalation from your supervisor to gain account access or to get a form approved...if they even can help.

Schedule flexibility, innovative work, fun coworkers, plenty to do around the area, insurance was covered by grants
I loved how flexible my research lab was to my schedule as a full-time student. And I'd love to note that this opportunity was very eye-opening for multiple reasons: 1) seeing research I was learning in class being applied, and 2) seeing my professors in a different environment
Once you have a class organized and the content ready to go, this is a great part-time gig.

If you are a student at ASU, Hayden library is a great place to work. Job tasks are relatively easy to learn and the staff are great. My position at Hayden is a patron-facing role, which involves staffing the front desk and closing the library. As such. I have had negative interactions with patrons, but the supervising staff always have the student workers' back. If you are looking to apply to a similar role, familiarity with library services and search engines is a must.
ASU Health Services Downtown as an amazing place to work. The entire team is caring and want to deliver the best care possible. It is the best healthcare team and clinic that I have ever worked at.

The faculty here are great and the campus is amazing
I likely wouldn't have been able to get my masters in journalism without the stipend i earned as a GA, so there's that for starters. Otherwise, i found the people in my program (students and professors/admin alike) to be overall very pleasant, smart and genuine people. Beautiful area of the country as well.

","Having to answer a lot of last-minute student queries
Too many students and too little pay. Pay is about $20,000 under market. Little to no support. Top down politics that don't care about contract faculty, including long term contact faculty. The problem with ASUs campaign to ""scale"" is it isn't providing the support or resources to scale. I teach classes of 150 students and don't have a TA or grader. The growth and rate of growth is unsustainable. I see it not just in academics but also in student services. ASU doesn’t have the infrastructure to support 144,000 students. Additionally, the ASU Online (EdPlus) funding model is unsustainable and only provides $80 per student to the colleges to cover costs, salaries etc... I have no idea where the remainder of the tuition goes since ASU refuses to be transparent, even after repeated requests.
I’m a Latina woman and my salary is 20 lower than the one of other u.s. and European people from the team with the same experience and position. I asked for a raise and I got 15% increase, still less than the rest, and months later I started to be threatened to be fired by my boss if I didn’t accomplish imposible tasks. Imposible because we didn’t even had the data for what he was asking.
High Living Cost Unprofessional Administrative and Advising Staff Members Unbearable Weather Terrible Dinning Experiences Low Pay
Pay and Benefits: Compensation for AE Assistant positions at ASU may vary, and it is essential to consider the financial aspect of the role.
- You could get a heavy workload depending on who your advisor is
None that are noteworthy imo.
8 am Shifts, Talk about the weather everyday.
Stereotypical public sector staff and poor pay, at least for in-demand roles in the public sector such as IT.
Low pay Unsupportive management Work/life balance
Large call volume, have to deal with angry parents.
Low pay, no options for performance based salary
I cant think of any cons

- You could get a heavy workload depending on who your advisor is
not great pay for a student
Stereotypical public sector staff and poor pay, at least for in-demand roles in the public sector such as IT.
Low pay Unsupportive management Work/life balance
it was really hard to get in to
cost of living is much higher than the pay, rent has nearly doubled in the past 5 years, parking is crazy expensive or a far walk in sketchy neighborhoods, only affordable housing options are with roommates or family wealth, many nearby apartment complexes are loud (the nice ones) or gross (the affordable ones), international students are manipulated with their VISAs, constantly construction or road closures that block traffic flow, paychecks were sometimes weeks late if the admin staff didn't process the paperwork in time at the start of each semester, student insurance is absolute garbage (used to have minimal dental coverage, now it's a ""discount card""), and many more than I care to list now.
None that I can note. I loved my research job while I was there
Getting a new class set up can be tedious, especially when inheriting it from another professor. More hands-on transition of courses would be nice.
The pay is not livable, and some of the direction can be confusing at first. Cons are not major but can influence individual experiences greatly depending on their capabilities to pivot and communicate effectively.
part time - not full time
Might have to travel to Mesa to talk to the professors for office hours or other meetings. This might be particularly difficult if you stay in Tempe (and especially are a student) and have to travel 35-50 minutes just for this purpose.
No room for grow Huge gap between salaries Constant leadership change
This job was presented as you would be helping students meet their goals. NO this is a call center- you have a script that you have to say on every single call. They look for you to say anything wrong- it so micromanaged it sad. They don’t trust their employees. They monitor every call when they no longer want you and bully you. They are not ethical and want people to entertain them instead of being sincere.
As a whole, admin at ASU are too stressed and not very great at managing said stress. So as a domino effect, many are just holding on.
Many large campuses are very spread out.
None that I know of
You have to fight very hard to get paid what you deserve. You need to really look into who you are going to be working with because it can either be very good or very bad,
Low pay as a research assistant/technician
Salary could be more equitable for cost of living
lower pay since it is a student job
Not keeping up with inflation
Work-life balance can be off for certain positions.
So many: extremely burned-out staff across areas, high turnover, low salary for staff (unsustainable for a single person who doesn't want to live in a sketchy, bug-infested apartment, despite having a graduate degree in higher education), poor direct supervision, push for innovation at ANY cost, employee counseling was a joke, I could go on but you get the picture.
Pay could be better with inflation and you pay for your parking permit.
New management was a little lost
The staff that has been around for a while is divided in how to proceed with how the public is consuming news and evolving to be more inclusive of this change.
Pay is not great as you could probably imagine
has to deal with bad situations
You have to change jobs in order to advance salary. Annual increases no longer reflect increases in cost of living. Management at the department/program level is mixed.
The summer in Tempe is quite harsh.
Nothing that I can think of.
Decisions happen very slowly. Merit increases do not keep up with the industry, but they are making efforts to change that.
Stay away from Teachers College student services. Started out great but if you raise any issues with leadership they will ignore you and you’ll be on their bad side. They will work you to the bone without any recognition of what you do for them. They will treat you as disposable no matter how many years you have been with them. The staff actually doing the work are wonderful everyone really cares about what they do, but higher up leadership are too academic and far removed from what is actually happening in the department. They do very little work for themselves and make decisions that are baffling.
The pay is quite low and the teaching load is quite heavy.
As a whole, admin at ASU are too stressed and not very great at managing said stress. So as a domino effect, many are just holding on.
Many large campuses are very spread out.
Workload/caseload never ends Metric focused
None that I know of
It's so hot in arizona and I get bored
lower pay since it is a student job
The salary should be better.
Lots of overtime work and a misogynistic environment.
shifts are hard to maintain
No prospects of moving up Play favorites
Lower Pay, Stressful environment at times
Nothing as such as a con for me
Particularly in business settings, Linux systems can have intricate configurations with several dependencies. Such setups might be difficult to troubleshoot because it calls for a thorough understanding of system architecture and component relationships.
for student the price is fine
Depth of work and the kind of work can be repetitive, however, it is an environment where you make the role suitable to you.
Workload/caseload never ends Metric focused
It's so hot in arizona and I get bored
No Work from Home for part timers, limited hours.
The benefits are not as supportive

A large and highly matrixed organization , there can be some level of duplicative efforts. Compensation for many roles seem behind Arizona’s growing cost of living.
Lots of overtime work and a misogynistic environment.
No cons were seen for me.
low pay for work amount
This place has a bad reputation that can poorly reflect on you
shifts are hard to maintain
No prospects of moving up Play favorites
Difficult to move up, no bonuses
They now are going to have no organic chemistry professors
Takes time away from my studying
A job that has a lot of competition.
Large place; easy to get lost in the crowd.
The hiring process is tedious, but that is true for ASU as a whole. A candidate can expect to wait 1-3 months before hearing back, both as a result of most student worker positions getting hundreds of applications and a slow-to-respond HR department.
The only con I can think of is pay. Pay is only $14/hr since I hold a student position. I do almost all the same tasks Medical Assistants do but get significantly lower pay.
Must pay for your own parking.
Low pay and dealing with a large bureaucracy
did not raise wages when minimum wage went up
There is a lot of restrictions on what funds can be spent on and how it can be spent
I don't really have any
Feelings of isolation and disconnection as a remote worker. Wish there was more travel. Miscommunications do occur a lot. Times it feels work is micro managed.
None. It has been a pleasant work experience
Only problem is massive strength of students. 200 students in every class.
no cons here. All good.
Uncompelling salaries, frequently slow job load, not much space for promotion.
have to fill this out to use glassdoor
Getting everything standardized would go a long way, this is actively being done of course
Lesser wage, suitable for people at Mesa
have potential developments hot summer can be better
-Only available to students -Experience will vary greatly depending on which department you work for -You may be capped out at 10 hours at some departments
pay isn't great, lot's of turn-over

Amazing benefits such as life insurance, short and long term disability, 401k match, stock discounts, generous PTO and Sick time (2 separate balances of hours to use) and if you like cutting edge it's interesting to learn about how microprocessors are built.
Benefits, Holidays, You can show up to work whenever and leave whenever because there is no form of supervision on the floor.
Applied Materials presents a challenging environment to work in and a chance to learn and grow tremendously. This company has taught me so many things, and as a result, I am a better engineer for it.
Hands on and great training while a tech. But engineering would rather hire people from outside who don't know anything about what they're working on. OT if you're willing.
Applied is pretty good to employees and the job stability/security is incredible. The people are nice and overall it's a decent place to work. Compensation isn't the best in the world but they try to make up for it in different ways.

I've thoroughly enjoyed working with a number of teams throughout my career, Applied has amazing people!!! My managers care about me as a person, listen to my thoughts and concerns, and proactively work to support me. Applied has an incredible breadth of career opportunities and interesting problems to solve so you'll never get bored. Employee growth/learning/development is highly valued. We support diversity and inclusion including LGBTQ+ communities. Applied supports employee wellness through several programs/benefits, and a wide range of onsite social gatherings. I have flexible working hours and a great deal of autonomy over my work. I truly love working for Applied Materials and am deeply appreciative! <3
Worked probably 20 hrs/week Learned a lot of valuable skills
Applied Materials is one of the most diverse companies I've worked with. Applied has headquarters in Santa Clara, CA but also has regional offices or manufacturing sites in: Austin, TX Dallas, TX Gloucester, MA Kalispell, MT Portland, OR Israel Singapore South Korea Taiwan China Japan Germany India This worldwide network of 30,000+ professionals creates a unique environment to work, learn, solve problems, and have fun with people from many different cultures.
Nice people Good pay Flexible hybrid schedule
Its a challenge but if you love logistics and moving commodities from point A to point B this is for you.
Everyone here is pretty helpful, at least in our team.
Employee Friendly, collaborative workspace, fast paced role
A lot of people pros will
Great company for work, good work life balance !
It is a good experience.
","Personally I do not have any cons …
None that I can remember.
They barely offered equal opportunities for less experienced engineers to develop technical skills. They awarded some people who never went to work for almost two years, and punished some hard working onsite people who had a legitimate reason for a time off just over a week. So biased, once the managers didn't see fancy PPT slides, you would be in a danger. Not just managers, they forced a lot of engineers who had a lot of tasks in the lab to join daily useless and non-relevant meetings for at least 3-4 hours, then you have put a lot of over time to finish the work should be done during regular schedule. Since they always spent more time on meeting rather than working, the projects were always delayed with a poor quality result.
Promotion opportunities are infrequent and once you're in the company they only give you a 2% annual raise. You can promote ""tiers"" or ""ranks"" for a larger raise but they try to stifle financial growth as much as possible making job hopping seem a better option than company loyalty. I've seen people with less industry experience hire in at nearly 40% higher pay than someone who stuck with the company and tried to promote from within.
There is no manager. There is someone hired as the manager but they are rarely on site. Coworkers can lie to HR without any evidence and just will go through. It has happened to at least 4 people who I know. You can just come at whatever time you want and take as many breaks as you want without any form of write up or warning. People show up 30-45 minutes late, take double the time for lunch and leave half an hour early. Somehow these people get overtime EVERY pay period. Its quite the mystery how, maybe something to do with nepotism and or favoritism. There is no expectation on your job performance. People make mistakes constantly and we were not able to tell them they did something wrong so the person will make the same error daily. Nepotism. There are a ton of families working here all over the campus and at all levels of the organization . That means if you are not family you probably won't get promoted or a higher position.
Sometimes organizational structure gets confusing and it is difficult for workers to find the right contacts or support for their issue.
Management finicky. Leading you on about growth opportunities. Lower base than competition. Lots of lies and gaslighting.
From a software perspective, some of the toolchains are a little dated but they are working to bring some aspects up to date.
Pay is something that might discourage some people.
Political with tendency to make things personal, can make too many demands/load too many tasks making job overwhelming.
Long hours, a lot of ""fire fighting""
Bit of a disconnect within leadership between business units

The only con I can think of is that there were a lot of hours but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for me.
Salary compensation and remote flexibility
Can travel a lot and work off hours
Heavy micromanaging during meetings which are hardly productive. Open communication to discuss improvements are dismissed. Management cannot get out of its own ways, refuses to see the root cause of self inflicted bottlenecks and will go after people just to cover up for their own willful ignorance.
Working for Mark Hamlin. a lead having to do everyone else's work. Unable to make someone do there job without HR getting involved. People who have fake Degrees.
The compensation can be more competitive.
Management is terrible. Work-life balance is poor. Schedule and workload are very unpredictable.
Bit of a disconnect within leadership between business units
Politics and fingerprinting - not always, but too much tolerance for this Sometimes hard to collaborate due to politics
Poor management, unmotivated colleagues. When I left, almost everyone on my team reached out to me confessing that they were looking to leave too.
The only con I can think of is that there were a lot of hours but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for me.
Salary compensation and remote flexibility
Pay is low for market rate
Work life balance is not a core value of the company. Depending on the position, expect to be overworked.
Do not expect recognition from management
Pay is low for market rate
Work life balance can suffer slightly as needed due to 24/7 company operations, Need to be on call at times,
Some of the older employees are not that forthcoming with sharing information. Maybe they are afraid of losing their job
We have to wait for promotion for a long time

Training not good for new employees
salary not so high compared to competitor
I am truly grateful for my experience at AMAT!
Might be group dependent but work life balance can be pretty rough. May take longer for promotions, or limit to promotions after Manager level since people tend to stay a long time. I've been told there are more forecasting cycles here than other companies. There are definitely pockets of toxic work culture within certain groups. Older culture in general compared to other Bay Area companies. You're not really going to have any team outings.
Pay was a little low compared to other companies, but they were doing a market rate adjustment last year
Slow promotion cycles, seem more interested in rewarding new commers than those that have stayed. A lot of great engineers who make mediocre managers but got Peter Principled
it's difficult to rise up easily
Large corporate environment, trying to raise the ranks is difficult and takes a lot of time. Internal job postings often were removed with no explanation. Interviewed internally for a position i was qualified for but the job posting was removed.
Distance and not a team work place
Applied is a very difficult place to meaningfully contribute. Curiosity and critical thinking are discouraged. Inter-departmental collaboration and support are not easy, nor forthcoming. Too often I feel that I am laboring in vain or being asked to ""innovate"" about corporate gossip. Even customer recognition of my work and quantifiable contributions to revenue are actively belittled by management. Respect for data or established science are rarely acknowledged. This has been my experience. I cannot comment on all of Applied Materials.
Long hours, otherwise no negatives
Long hours throughout the weekend depending on shift.
Work timings Lots of meetings
not good work life balance
Work life balance can suffer slightly as needed due to 24/7 company operations, Need to be on call at times,
Long shifts work you like a horse
Not many promotional chances Repetitive work Bureaucracy Employee's limited knowledge due to IP protection
Below average pay, HR is a nightmare
Diversity is not same in all group.
You work so hard but get nothing extra in return. The salary can barely cover the cost of living in Silicon Valley area. No life at all. The environment is so toxic. If you want to come to DDP, talk to someone from the team to see if you will change your idea.

Traffic is heavy in this area
large company with lots of divisions
Gets very very busy often times. Have to keep up with the enormous pace
Management cares about Management, a lot of pointless small routines
Work life balance needs improvement
nothing was bad working here.
Culture is masculine with little gender diversity
Fast paced. Not for everyone.
Salary is heavily based on your manager. Some will readily give promotions and extra bonuses, while some let their employees go several years without a raise. They say it’s performances based but it’s not always the case. Very unqualified people hired for positions they are not suited for, leaving bulk of the work for their teammates to pick up. They will never fire someone for under performing. FTO policy is a scam. It has led everyone to take less time off than before with PTO policy. No formal training for new employees. You are lucky if you get a “buddy” for onboarding, otherwise you need to fend for yourself. Although the overall culture is good, some departments can be extremely abrasive and unprofessional.
1. Cyclic business may increase the possibility to get suffered during a downturn
Tons of corporate initiatives that have no regards to the effects of the working level. Focus more to meeting Wall Street numbers and true productivity.
Still have to pay for medical coverages.
The culture has issues with honesty, is more ""corporate"" than most of the other suppliers of Semiconductor equipment. I was labeled a racist by an illiterate liar. I was never allowed to defend myself with my Manager who immediately referred to me HR, after denying that what he was told could in any way be false. I was 'fished' by the HR rep I talked to, they would not say what I said only that by using the word 'assault' for which was actually used by the person who accused me. My only sin was trying to joke with that guy who was actually someone I was training, someone who had almost no experience in a clean room, someone who lied about their direct labor contribution, and someone who clearly had connections I did not. I was also stole from by this person, and badgered over text about how I should let people take my stuff, and how it was acceptable to take my stuff and leave it where ever, having to 'find' my personal tools in a fab larger than a few football fields. I was also sent an email about how I gave someone a head job when nothing could be further from the truth. Yet, with all this evidence, my manager denied and would not respond to any evidence against this person. -- TRASH.
Getting hired on full-time can take a while
pay rate is not that high
Management issue. They have to reevaluate their work.
Stock share is much lower than big tech companies
Work load is high and working during weekend
They need to be better at communicating with their workers.
Poor management leads to a toxic work environment and destroys the work culture. There's a lack of support from the management team. The pay raises could've been better. Also, there's little to no upward mobility.
Applied Materials is a massive company with multiple business units that are a bit siloed. Improvements could be made by developing more effective management tools that are streamlined across groups. Working hours can be intense for some, depends on your group and your personal boundaries. Applied could provide more competitive salaries.
The work and work force can feel boring or uninspiring at times.
Due to the large company size with individuals in multiple locations, certain actions and procedures may not happen has quickly due to approvals and process steps may need to be communicated and then completed by other teams in different time-zones.
Managers work long hours that trickle down to lower levels
Can be overwhelming at times
Not a clear path for career development.
lesser stock options as compared to other companies
None. I don’t think any
The CTC is not as good as other tech/semiconductor company.
Pretty intense and fast pace

","The pay is pretty low
Pay was minimal, as were raises. No real opportunities for growth.
Management wasn’t very nice, but only some people
-Low pay -Poor work life balance
pay is more for coege/high school students
Incredibly boring and the managers felt like they owned you
The company is severely declining as workload is increasing greatly and payroll is dropping. Nothing ever gets completed due to lack of payroll. Management pay hasn’t been raised in 10 years despite minimum wage increasing 40% during that time. Annual raises are only 2.5%. There are no performance raises. Monthly sales bonuses are incredibly difficult to achieve and I only received 2 in the past 5 years I’d worked there. When all your long time employees are jumping ship, it’s a sign to get out.
shifts are short, and sometimes hard to get
revolving door of employees both in the store and at the corporate level, low pay and high expectations, no resources to genuinely fix problems within the store
Busy on weekends long closing hours
It was fun so I don't have cons
Working in retail is difficult because of the customers sometimes.
Little chance to move up
- Management - Entitled and annoying customers - Hard to get hours - Favoritism
boring and can be picky with stock when theft is high
Management wasn’t very nice, but only some people
corporate needs to get their things together soon if they don't want us to close down. They are making terrible decisions when really they just need to stop being cheap and pay good people a good salary to get them to stay. Also, get more size-inclusive, it's way overdue, and it's nasty that they haven't tried harder.

not enough pay for hard work

the majority of my complaints are in regard to corporate decisions. specifically undervaluing their retail employees - I started out as a sales associate, worked for a year, and was promoted to keyholder. Less than six months later, the decision was made to eliminate the full-time keyholder position. In each store, one keyholder would become part-time and the other a part-time product flow specialist. We were not informed of this decision until the day it was to go into effect, with instructions to either accept the demotion by EOD or be let go - PTO benefits are incredibly limited - little pay for a lot of responsibility and physical labor

not enough pay for hard work
typical retail issues: very low pay. short breaks. entitled customers. management has accused staff of stealing or not being able to afford to buy the clothes bought from the store with the hourly wage. those who choose to stay at UO to grow (which is really just to lead and manager) make very little money. no room for career growth. get your experience and discount and move on to better things
If you end up with a manager who isn't really into the job, it can be tough. It feels like you're left to figure things out on your own. Another downside is that you don't get a raise every year like some other retail companies. The only way to get a raise is by becoming a manager, but even then, the pay isn't that great.
Low pay was the biggest con of this job.
To be fair, I worked right as the pandemic hit and after so the workload increased a major amount and a lot of people stopped working. That being said, the company didn't pay well at all and it was very difficult to get a pay raise. I worked part time for two years and wasn't able to work full time because hours were prioritized to new workers and I wouldn't receive any pay increase from moving from part time to full time.
work/life balance, low pay, big workload
Poor management at times, difficulty communicating with upper management
It can feel like the management is unorganized and looks down on you.
Sparse hours, but no true cons really.
Not the best pay, may not be enough hours depending on what you need

difficult customers are usually the hardest part
not a lot of hours over staffed or short staffed
hard to grow internally company decisions don't have retail stores in mind difficult to get pay raise leadership/management positions don't pay enough not enough full time positions
some days were just super boring
The company should have never opened those monstrosity concept stores in Herald Square, Williamsburg, WTC, etc….all this started happening around 2014, when it didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that shoppers consuming habits were rapidly changing via online retailers & other competitors. Now the company can’t afford these spaces, & couldn’t even do so at the time. So what do they do? Constantly eliminate positions all the while adding more & more workload to current employees, with no increase in compensation or career guidance to move up in their roles. On top of that, the folks working in the stores take all the blame for the financial woes in the company. UO has no one to blame but themselves, & it’ll only be a matter of time that this ship will sink just like bed, bath, & beyond & many others.
not many hours low pay
Poor management at times, difficulty communicating with upper management
Management was bad and uptight
-very poor management staff -too many unqualified employees (there’s a new person every week but they get fired within a month because they don’t do anything) -always getting robbed
It can feel like the management is unorganized and looks down on you.
- Loss Prevention SUCKS and they let people steal from their stores and then blame employees for the lost merchandise - Long hours - On your feet all day - Angry moms
Sparse hours, but no true cons really.
However, the managers definitely are bias towards employees that suck up, versus employees that are hardworking.
Management is questionable, scheduling is inconsistent
No appreciation, lowest possible pay, yo
pay is pretty low, lol

Minimum wage starting pay isnt the best
Management was bad and uptight
The building had to close ): but the company offered to transfer associates to other locations which was awesome
Pretty typical retail job, lots of standing, sometimes rude customers.
No accountability for other employees sloppy work efforts.
Managers doesn’t know how to manage
Great deal of responsibilities added for the position however you only get a $1 raise
They do not care about you as a person and HR will F you over as soon as you need them.
Sometimes can be tiring for sure
Very little hours towards the end of my time There, manager have to meet hiring requirements but, there a such little hours to go around
not much too think off
They do not care about their employees
customer service is a difficult task facing diverse customers
pay is pretty low, lol
i didn’t experience many issues
The social setting wasn’t amazing and a lot of the time it felt as if people gossiped and were just generally hostile to individuals they didn’t prefer.
- Sale section always a mess - Hands-off training from managers, other associates expected to train you - Busy location means more corners cut in terms of customer service - Usually scheduled max amount of time w/o required lunch break (a 5.5 hour shift with one 10 minute break) - One worker expected to maintain large areas of store - Rude customers with no shopping etiquette - Minimum wage even though it is one of the country's top Urban stores and always busy - Overwhelming at times
You’ll be told that if the store meets its goals for the month, that you’ll get a bonus payout. What they don’t tell you is you rarely have enough coverage or hours to make everything happen that needs to happen.
let everyone go out of no where
Minimum wage starting pay isnt the best
The pay is pretty average and be prepared to stand on your feet all day , much like any retail position.
Promotions will rarely go to workers who have the experience and time at a store
The building had to close ): but the company offered to transfer associates to other locations which was awesome
lack of former training, small lunch break
Terrible over summer when it’s crowded and for back to school. The sale section gets absolutely destroyed and it’s impossible to fully clean before closing.
everything is perfect love life
low pay for part time
Low hours Management (location matters) Customers
Pretty typical retail job, lots of standing, sometimes rude customers.
Great deal of responsibilities added for the position however you only get a $1 raise
Not many hours available for associates.
not every customer is going to be nice to you
- nothing - very relaxes and nice manager
customers are sometimes rude and perfect close is stressful
Good for part time spending money, not enough to sustain livelihood.
organization needs to be prioritized
no commission underpaid cliquey employees
nothing to share here its fine
the management and company as a whole was awful
Late nights resetting tables after close, upper management is non existent and plays favorites. Expect to stay late for 100% resets before corporate visits. They love the downtown stand alone stores and didn’t care about the suburban mall stores. Very cliquey
switching schedules wasn't as easy going.
Management was cliquey and all knew each other for many years so any complaints about conditions were not taken seriously by higher ups, and there was no HR department
Poor hours, overworked at times

Coming from the outside you already know more than 90% of the company with regards to Industry trends, How and What people Buy, and likely the better way to operationalize or execute. They know how to invent things but not productize and certainly not take to market.

Leadership has made great strides in acquiring and maintaining talent. As a result, I have had the opportunity to work with some incredibly smart and talented individuals. The work environment values experimentation and growth.
EPAM Systems culture is amazing. Senior managers care about your success, concerns, and growth within EPAM. They care about your health, mental health, and financial goals. I can only say good things about EPAM. The client they work with are also amazing and great to work with. It is truly an amazing organization.

Less or no bureaucracy People friendly employer Great relocation opportunities across world
Everyone is very driven, professional, and smart, but at the same time, they're kind and helpful to each other. It's a good collaborative environment.
","Salary range slightly off, but not a game changer RSUs only for distinguished professionals
Salary might be better, no free food
EPAM has a ton of systems and micro-manages everyone to excessive levels of data entry on what is happening (daily). Everyday, a raft of new systems, rules, products (that are not products), and capabilities are introduced so it is very hard to know what is important versus what is not. Very tribal and silo based.
Very beurocratic and archaic structure and governance currently the amount of projects is low, people are sitting on bench, salaries are not increasing but decreasing, atmosphere is mostly negative, people are afraid about loosing their jobs Also, if you need a visa, they will try to use you as much as possible Just do not recommend, it's a waste of time
Management should not be bias, they should not terminate an employee in order to prove a point to their higher-ups.
Average to market salary could be higher
Basically they will use you as is, no development no growth. They simply not interested in it. After few years you will be terminated due to lack of project as happend to me.
Hard to get promotions + hard to get big bonuses + you are a consultant...
Can be overworked from time to time depending on level.
No major red flags that I have noticed so far.
No major red flags that I have noticed so far.
As a technology agency, we have A LOT of engineering talent. EPAM clearly builds solutions, and in my experience, lands more engineering projects than design/build projects. They come, but it's not our bread & butter. Less of a con, and more of a reflection of design in the US-dominated technology market. Kinda have to go where the dollars are! I still hold firm to my assessment that this place will advance your skills if you are ready to work!
Compensation might not be on par with MAANG companies but it's decent for the industry.
There's no clear vision coming from senior management. A lot of micro-management and unnecessary meetings.
Consulting is challenging. I think some may find it easier to be on the client side.
No cons i can think of.
Poor salary review in company/
I can recommend if you are jun/middle lvl specialist.
Pay could be better, being a vendor has its shortcomings
- can feel lost / disconnected while remote working
You're unlucky if you're working in alone mode
salary was not very good
Extremely cool system of employee improvement.
- Sometimes you can faced problem when you trying to get new position or salary promotion, but it very depends of your manager. But also you can always make request and change your manager or discuss about it with more higher manager.
Sometimes need to work overtime
Downsizing. Low salary. No future
Some projects are not as good/interesting as the others, but usually you can change the project if you don’t like it.
Average employment is ~ 12 months in the group I was in. A lot of turn-over No managerial direction or focus Be prepared for billing hours over all
Working remotely while I'd prefer hybrid
After project, future projects looking bleak.
Essence of consultancy work is in it's unpredictability - once your project is over - you have to start from scratch - from different (lower) position, from different (not so popular) location. Really it means you have to search another job. Also, as a consultant you fill strange among other colleagues who do administrative work - you nether fill you belong to the team, you are temporary consultant. That may or may not suit to everyone.
The things that are promised very different from what you will get
projects are usually very short, so much of uncertainty
Payment can be better. Some managers are not really good.
Awful work-life balance, No transparency, Overburn Leadership is not focused on resource career growth communication gap between leadership team and mid senior resources. Company is not performing well because of lack in leadership, Stocks went down more than 60% Firing people is the easiest decision for the management not to develop their skills They will just fire when you are on the bench, it is not worth even considering no projects atleast in US
Benefits can be improved .

The salary offered may not be the highest on the market.
Low salary, low bonuses, terrible projects, no safe future
Salary Projects Salary Projects Salary Projects
lack of direction from leadership
- no stock options - promotion
- Salary negotiation can be complicated depending on what type of engagement ppl are working on
Low Compensation for the YoE Jumping between Projects Low chances for growth (Depends on client)
Mostly cons is a resource management practice. Unfortunately, relationship with RM will influence at all your working aspects at company. I would say that company splits in parts by resource managements pools and each pool represent separate small company. So, unfortunately, I have to leave from company due to misunderstanding and accumulated contradictions with my RM. Generally, I'm leaving not from company, but from my RM. As I said, I believe that RM practice must to be reformed.
- no stock options - promotion
No cons to mention; I wish we had more transparency on work that was coming down the pipeline
Remote work is challenging when teams are distributed globally.
I do not really see any substantial cons
Because of startup culture can be disorganized, some practices/competencies can be siloed.
- Salary negotiation can be complicated depending on what type of engagement ppl are working on
Salary range slightly off, but not a game changer RSUs only for distinguished professionals
small amount of products inside the company
Too focus on being billable.

Switch between project to project. Can’t stay more time with one project
- salary is slightly less than average on market
no guidance really, kinda up to you to make it happen. Also handling the time zones and resourcing is complicated.
low salary, and slowly raise proccess
Salaries a bit less than in other, because of consulting
Bad bay and bad salary
As any other vendor employee you will constantly facing with a lot of access restrictions , data restrictions and so on on the customer side
- Bureaucracy and slow in changes (like all big companies)
Some operational tooling is tedious but everything that can be done to transform and innovate is welcomed.
I didn't face big problems in my work
medium salary size, recognition can be better
not good compensation, culture and other
Remote nature of the work force (even before Covid) hinders any kind of culture or local community connection.
- Some projects will require relocation
Not allot of feedback from the company.
Can bare some heavy weight on you at times
The quality of the work you're involved in varies greatly by project. Some projects are overpromised from the beginning, leading to many individuals burning out and requesting a project change or leaving EPAM. Some teams have frequent changes with very little communication, which can lead some to feel disenfranchised.
Low total compensation compared to industry
Intense culture. Poor brand recognition for non engineering. Secret kept too well.

lack of transparancy with higher management
Salary is slightly below other market competitors.
None so far in all aspects
The compensation is not above the market, but it is ok since it is below.
Low salaries Long on boardinf
- salary might be better - some times it is just business
Consulting can eat to easy burnout, which is any consulting role.
It's hard to take the new title/position
Management control operates from outside India Can be more assertive management Project allocation timelines for recently joined people. This can be made better Client interview process
I dont see any cons with this company.
Jobs tend to be very focused so the variety in the work is minimal

","I can’t think of any
Roche values are just catch phrases. Ultimately, many leaders don’t follow them or openly mock them. They aren’t held accountable to them. Apparently no mandatory leader training to improve their people skills. A bad leader is allowed to be a bad leader indefinitely and without accountability. Illogical spending. Blow a ton of cash on a cafeteria that didn’t need replacing and have a manufacturing space that needed expansion 5+ years ago. Nickel and diming that project now.
-Arrogant and frankly unqualified management; highly questionable work ethics and non-existent communication between shifts or between managers and employees -Layoff hundreds of employees, only to use employees left from other departments to fill in the gap, displaying lack of foresight -Constant pressure to do more with little-to-no reward -Gradual decline in the perks of the job in spite of personal performance
Hierarchy, Europe-leadership, Time zone, HR
Came in from the high tech industry as an engineer. Salary is not commiserate to high tech. But, from what I understood from other co-workers, the biotech industry in general does not pay as well. Came out disillusioned about the healthcare industry. I left high tech to help make the world a better place. It is not always about the end patient, but really sometimes about profit.
Strict Manager and hectic supervision
Very high level of cronyism. If you don’t know the right people or have the right friends, you’re not going to move up.
Pay is not keeping up with competitors and the market
Very corporate style of culture
Over the past 5 years, leadership has created a culture that rewards political maneuvering over production and achievement. The cultural value of speaking up is no longer safe to engage in. If you are not sharing positive news, you are not rewarded for making data driven analysis of the current situation.

If you are not sharing positive news, you are not rewarded for making data driven analysis of the current situation.
They are not focused on the customer. The processes prevent innovation. Entrenched middle management is powerless and unmotivated. Internal politics and culture suppress getting simple projects from getting done.
None that I could think of
The process is very rigid and often don't focus on innovation
Large company with many different departments - can be hard to find who you need.
The laid a bunch of people off regularly.
I don't have any cons.
Over emphasis on policies (diversity & inclusion and moving jobs to lower cost locations) have created: 1) Limited career growth opportunities 2) Inexperienced and incompetent leadership
Training isn't the best, you'll have to self train in many instances. Internally, the company can be disorganized. Alphabet soup of acronyms can make understanding the landscape and players a real challenge.
Where do I even start. 1) Be prepared to always get the line, ""You're salaried, you should be working for as long as we tell you."" While this is ok sometimes, it's is definitely not ok all the time. 2) No one (in upper management) gives 2 cookies about your disability, an accident you were in, your kids' schooling or your newborn. Either work and don't complain or get unreasonable work loads and be fired for not working well. 3) Have a dental or doctor's appointment? Sorry but take that during your lunch break but also be available during your lunch break for meetings and how dare you not be available. 4) Top people from Roche are here, act happy everyone! 5) Did I mention the mandatory 8am to 6pm work schedule? No exceptions. 6) I'm management and I'm never wrong, you must be the one doing something wrong. You take care of it, I'm too busy to help you. Honestly, I can go on but that should give you a good idea why the Seattle location is such an awful place to work. There are other great biotechs in Seattle, you'll absolutely regret it if you work here.
They don't promote their company culture and values
No room for growth or promotion. Showed alot a favoritism to certain employees. I’m the end a lot of people left.
Worst professional environment ever seen in my experience. People discourage others , speak ill of the team and it wasn't a healthy environment place to work with, and I strongly advise HR team to take action items on the same. They do layoff on Full time resource due to their bad financial budgeting and create a lot of chaos.
None that I could think of
Last years with different transformations.
The process is very rigid and often don't focus on innovation
Large company with many different departments - can be hard to find who you need.
If you're in a team that isn't great, your whole experience will be terrible.
I don't have any cons.
A lot of disorganization and poor communication with no real motivation to change. Some managers are great - others are terrible, and there doesn’t seem to be any desire for further management training to ensure that this is less hit or miss.
Last years with different transformations.
Do not have any cons
If you're in a team that isn't great, your whole experience will be terrible.
People problems (happens anywhere), some OT needed to fill occasional gaps
Benefits could be improved globally, and a recent crackdown on travel related expense.
A lot of disorganization and poor communication with no real motivation to change. Some managers are great - others are terrible, and there doesn’t seem to be any desire for further management training to ensure that this is less hit or miss.
No Cons - No Cons
Expectation of long hours as not always ample staff to complete work.
working hours can be extended and expected
Gossip, gossip gossip....Including managers, everybody talks behind another. It's a shame truly, because Roche company itself has been doing great work in patients' lives. Bad management, instead of teaching the material, they give you bunch of sighs and eye rolls. Sadly, the people are not professionals/ take their jobs seriously. It's a good company if it's your first time job. However, career growth isn't supported. I felt discriminated and excluded throughout my employment.
Lots of red tape and political cliques
A lot of traveling and training initially.
Same cons as working for a massive company, a little red tape when doing certain tasks.
Since the new CEO took over Roche Diagnostics things have been going down hill. First a push to get people back in the office with no performance/efficiency reasons stated. Flexible work environment is going away, employees losing choice of whether to work remote or in person for any role. And now occupancy sensors are being installed. Roche is losing its competitive edge in regards to employee compensation and flexible work environments.
it is difficult to advance.
Nothing bad to say at all about this company
A lot of cliques and gossip. Corporate friendliness. Not too bad if you can tolerate it.
Leadership is not accountable for demonstrating 'Roche values', and is incredibly 'top-down'. Employees are not empowered to make decisions. A lot of back-stabbing, competitiveness, lack of collaborative attitude. Higher leadership choses to be completely blind to these issues. No real commitment to diversity and inclusion- all talk no action.
work a lot at the studio
There's no feedback loop for subordinates to provide feedback regarding supervisors. I was having problems with my manager and when I talked to leadership, they knew there were some problems with my manager and others but didn't ask me or colleagues what the issues were; we weren't able to speak without feeling we would be penalized.
the schedule is of 12 hours per day.
Can be reactive, typical large company bureaucracies.
Been with the company for 4 years now. Pay increases are not matching with cost of living increases. If you want a raise it’s difficult to get unless you change position within the company.
I have found that the Talent Team can at times be competitive which is good if its healthy. In the last 6 months, I have experienced 2 -3 scenarios where my colleagues used "" gaslighting"" to attempt cause issues for me here at Roche. I enjoy the work but believe even in today's market team work & collaboration should always come before egos and attitudes.
Favoritism/ Not fair across the board/ Lack of communication/ Not truthful about important topics.
Can be too political, can be pigeonholed
It is FAR from the high tech company they advertise to be. Wiped out benefits during covid, managers are trash and on yearly employee audits managers get horrible reviews but nothing changes, a revolving door of VIPs take all the funding while they blame the labs working on skeleton crews. VIP's directly tell you it's not about helping people, its about getting them a new yacht (no joke). Tons of office politics, and I've seen some disturbing anti-lgbt actions. Tons of company cover-ups whenever they do any wrongdoing. Not as bad as Thermo, but they will totally screw you over on pay and FTE conversion.
Decision making process can be slow at times.
Competitive environment. If you want to grow you have to make that clear but once you do it is encouraged.
Hard to find a full time
The company has a very clickish way of working. If you’re not in, you get shown the door. The company also lets people go while they are out on disability after 17 year of service with no insurance or benefits. Management doesn’t care about their employees.
Same cons as working for a massive company, a little red tape when doing certain tasks.
Grow from inside. It is easier to leave and come back!
Need to be very political to get ahead
work a lot at the studio
the schedule is of 12 hours per day.
Can be reactive, typical large company bureaucracies.
Salary increase is not compatible with inflation in the last two years. Also bonus could be higher when compared with other companies
Management is cut throat, not supportive, and only care about how they look to the executive pool. Not inclusive and not willing to listen to differing opinions.
Can be too political, can be pigeonholed
felt stagnant, pay is low for the area, title inflation
Slow promotion A bit low in pay
There are very few cons - Roche is a terrific company
Work can be monotonous sometimes.
Currently, the company is going through a change. Many of the people who were in management 20+ years are on the move to other companies in the area.
the job has long hours
Can be difficult to move around to different roles
The company has a very clickish way of working. If you’re not in, you get shown the door. The company also lets people go while they are out on disability after 17 year of service with no insurance or benefits. Management doesn’t care about their employees.
Allow room for growth for their employees
Some people work with difficult individuals, seen it most in Georgia area but it happens in other teams
Hard to relate to when early in career
Grow from inside. It is easier to leave and come back!
Need to be very political to get ahead
Reorgs can be fairly frequent
In some areas, lack of formal onboarding.
Experiences can depend on department and management
Big organization that can be slow
Personally on-call doesn't bother me but I know for some people they'd rather not.
Salary increase is not compatible with inflation in the last two years. Also bonus could be higher when compared with other companies
none to think of currently
I have really enjoyed working here
Management is cut throat, not supportive, and only care about how they look to the executive pool. Not inclusive and not willing to listen to differing opinions.
Extensive travel for field positions.
Work life balance can be hard to navigate
Big company so things can take a little longer to get done.
If you are over 50, they don't value you. Too many layers of management. Germany dominated organization.
Management needs to reward highly contributive members much more and provide a good work/life balance. This is not being done nor even discussed among company leaders. Institutional knowledge is not valued enough and should be considered gold.
Building peer relationships is slower in remote positions.
Lots of ineffective middle management, now mainly hiring in cheaper markets where employees are not effective
Being a huge company, your experience for the same role might vary widely from group to group. Lots of red tape, training etc and as lean as it’s trying to become you inevitably run into a career professional who’s worked the same way for 20 years, is now quite high up and doesn’t want to budge on their positions. But almost every project is on a 5 year plan. Industry works that way, so if you’re looking for a faster pace, not the place to be.

I like their emphasis and career development and felt like my managers genuinely cared about me and my development. I also liked that there was a culture of when you take time off, you are actually off. There were no expectations to work while on leave or be ""on call.""

nice job with good colleagues
At AZ, we truly have a wonderful and inclusive culture where we work collaboratively across all functions and areas to impact our patients across the globe.
","Competitive places, multiple interviews, worth it at the end
Constant changes and realignments EV vehicles
- AZ health insurance through Aetna is absolute GARBAGE. I'm paying more in my monthly paycheck and out of pocket for routine preventative visits than I have with previous companies. - Compensation is NOT COMPETITIVE (i.e. lower than other companies), and NOT CONSISTENT. HR continues to put out a narrative and rhetoric that AZ pays competitively, but you can ask employees about how they've been paid at other companies and it is not as good. Mind you, you're not getting pennies, but for a global, large company, AZ is absolutely riding on their reputation as the biggest company in Maryland to pay less than the competition. As a general rule, ASK YOUR CO-WORKS ABOUT SALARIES. Management and HR will make it seem like that brews jealousy and stirs the pot in the workplace but this information helps all employees learn what their company thinks they are worth. For example: it was found out that some new undergraduate employees were actually being paid MORE than a full-time employee with 2 years of experience at AZ. Can you imagine being at a company for 2 years and find out that a brand new college graduate is being paid more than you? - Senior leadership is 100% profit driven in their decision-making, with little regard to everyone below them. The company is unfocused. Priorities shift wildly and urgently - you can work incredibly hard for months on a project and then your project is immediately trashed because another company came out with a product before AstraZeneca. Alternatively, you can be assigned a project and have to get it through development as fast as possible because there's a race to get to clinicals and someone is already working on that therapeutic. AZ is always 1 step behind, chasing trends, rather than being a trendsetter or leader in the industry. I know AZ is a for-profit company, so of course decisions are profit-driven. But those decisions are seemingly made to burn out and turnover employees at the lower salary levels because those are the cheapest and quickest employees to replace. AZ lives in an area with access to a lot of impressive universities so they know they can just churn through new graduates every single year - teach them the skills they need the first year, and grind them until they leave. - I think since senior leadership knows AZ is lagging behind others, some development groups are pushed HARD. While I think work-life balance is very good under a lot of groups, other groups that senior leadership is very interested in seeing succeed are pressured with insane timelines, and that pressure cascades down all the way to the bottom level employees who are doing the labwork. Some scientists have worked every single weekend for the first 6 months of this year. Some scientists have accumulated so much compensation time but they have no avenue to take all that time off because they are expected to hit certain goals for their projects. I have been fortunate to not be involved in any of this but I see it and it does not look good. Last notes: I have not worked in other companies in this area. I do not know if people come to AZ because all the other companies in Maryland are worse, and AZ is just the only option in the area with the best mix of salary, culture, and stability. But being the best of the worst doesn't make it good. Also, this list of cons makes it seem like it's awful to work here. It's not at all. There are worse companies to work for all around. This long list of cons is here to show that we have high expectations of AZ considering it's reputation and size. AZ is a successful company, and it should seemingly have the profits to compensate its employees better. No one cares about mugs and shirts and freebies with the AZ logo on them. Pay people better. Get people better health insurance. Respect people's 40 hour work weeks.
Not much. Maybe just the location isn't that great.
Some senior leaders have been in the same position too long, giving them a disproportionate amount of influence and at times innovation can stagnate. ""this is how we normally do things."" The longer the person in role, the more opportunity or lack of for others.
There is limited flexibility for working at various office sites or 100% remote.
I don't see any cons for now
The sales force is large which could lead to future downsizing
Busy and varied schedules based on work
Most groups have top-down culture that rewards ""yes-man"" mentality, people with no management experience being promoted into managerial roles with 4+ direct reports, elitism, politics (even among scientists)
Sometimes your product portfolio can change.
Nothing not good so far
I've had 3 roles here and I'd say I wasn't a huge fan of much of the culture I'm the Manufacturing department. In terms of pay there are other biotechnology companies in the area that pay more but also you have some that pay less. I know that's not a great answer but given the size and impact Astrazenca has on the drug market I wish the pay matched that
Nothing, great place to work
Workload is generally high. Company travel is very limited to meet the CO2 goals.
Return to work, and more inflecxible from the MedImmune days
-Very global (which is good and bad), so sometimes overlap with coworkers in small
None. This was a great place
very disorganized and hard to navigate. if you're a middle-aged white or European guy, this is your place! Very paternalistic, male-dominated organization with dinosaurs at the top, so old school attitudes. No 360 reviews so mediocre (and less than) managers stay in place and climb the ladder. No exit interviews, so they don't really want to hear what's not working. ""Speak up culture"" is just politically correct noise. Not very advanced compared to other companies in terms of infrastructure, IT, etc. I would not recommend working here.
- Some things move slowly because of the large size of the company. - Compensation for this position is sub-par.
Bureaucratic and political in parts
Sometimes unclear how to achieve promotions or opportunities depending on manager, can feel like there are too many projects to support with the headcount, too many tier 1 projects make prioritization difficult. As with most companies, too many people are made line managers just so they can receive a promotion, but they have no desire for or skill at management. This leaves lots of employees adrift while the ones lucky enough to have a good manager thrive.
New Management is unfriendly and desires interns to work on menial tasks or ""busy work"" instead of learn and explore to develop and further their career
Small company issues Goals a little ridiculous
They work their sales people beyond a reasonable point. Most CV Specialty Reps work in excess of 50 hours a to meet the multiple metrics were measured on. Very Toxic Work Environment. New Senior leaders are very Micro Managers, multiple reports and metrics impossible to do all that they want us to do.
No cons that I can think of
Are we making medicines or are we a sustainability company, the line is confusing.
I don't have any cons.
Very cut-throat in some areas, depending on leader. Excessive job-changing enables ladder-climbing, based on politics, without accountability for results from previous role. Overall, classic corporate environment. Prepare to navigate the sharks.
AstraZeneca is constantly Changing the things that they think are important and creating and eliminating roles, and making knee jerk downsizing reactions to in the wind forcasting. Also its a check the box performance review system

Annual pay increase does not keep up with yearly increase of cost of living but they make up for it with a generous bonus
pays less than the competition

More inclined towards Offshore billing and less interested to fund on Onsite resources
They got lots of resources and they give good pay so they definitely expect lots of results very quickly. The fast pace is something I had to get used to so if that is not your cup of tea, it might be a problem. They could also do a better job in the training when your start. There are some many videos that are not very helpful and are unnecessarily long.

Company propaganda feels a little weird and unnecessary... Just stick with the facts as they are positive enough as is.
Too much fun to control

no assigned desks, labs are too crowded, not enough instruments, slow growth
Push for onsite work by top brass is nonsensical when most teams work globally on zoom sitting in open floor plan all day and they wonder why everyone keeps getting sick.
Very large company and some corporate policies that can be a bit restrictive when applied rigidly. Because large, some disconnects in priorities between business units can occur and is a hurdle to collaboration at times.
1. They monitor how many times you swipe your badge in the office and if it is not at least 3x per week, it is a problem. I went on vacation one week and got asked why I wasn't in 3x that week. My line manager had to explain to HR that I was on annual leave. It was not a problem in the end, but the fact that someone was tracking me so closely made me very uncomfortable and feel like Big Brother was watching. 2. No flexible teleworking options. They used to allow you to telework more, and now the company is cracking down hard. The company has announced that they will penalize your bonus if you are not in 3x weekly in 2023, and they applied that retrospectively to on-site attendance in 2022, which was quite bizarre and surprising to both employees and managers alike when they executed on this. 3. Overworked and under-resourced for priority studies, which puts so much extra pressure on employees. 4. Culture needs lots of work. They are constantly changing their policy on conference attendance and say you can only go if you have a business reason (which basically means if you are attending an important steering committee meeting or similar). It used to be that you would go for learning and developing and meeting people, but this has changed. It means that most clinical scientists end up not having a good ""business reason"" since we typically aren't steering committee members, and only physicians end up going to conferences. 5. The open office environment is also terrible--I had to spend countless mornings hunting for a space to work because there are not enough desks for everyone in the department. It feels like you are working in a call center because there aren't enough quiet rooms and as a global company, we are all on calls daily with our colleagues from across the globe. So it looks and feels like a call center. Very challenging to actually get reading/writing/data review done in such a chaotic environment and I never end up sitting next to my actual team because there are no assigned desks.
Overworked, 3x a week mandatory at office or will be punished by deduction of bonus and pay
Large company means that some decisions take a long time.
no a real development path
After 5 years I don’t have a con… it is a great company
The hours can sometimes be long, 50 hour weeks were the norm.
The business role does not provide a work visa
Recently demonstrating little to no loyalty to employees and seem to care more about being on site 3 days a week that productivity or any other measurable innovative outcome. Now seem to care more about obedience than anything else. Current autocratic leanings will feel stifling to innovative productive people who dislike rules for rules sake or who create disruption with innovation.
Micro-management, unrealistic sales goals, high pressure
Company and global teams seem siloed leading to inefficiency.
difficult hours to manage on the workdays
Nothing to add that’s negative
- Dishonest leadership that cuts employees bonuses without a warning based on the office attendance - Lack of accountability for poor decisions impacting employees. Decisions are made based on favoritism - Lower level employees doing work get no credit. The environment is not collaborative which creates a lot of duplication of work and inefficiencies - The benefits vary tremendously depending on the country you're based in (parental leave, vacation days, etc.) - Lack of life/work balance, the compensation does not match the workload
None literally there are no cons
i don't have anything to add
Rigidity boardering on fanatical about so many things - emissions, being on-site, lack of transparency. trying to keep people on the anxious by not being open and honest about policies or large scale workforce decisions.
Small postdoc group takes away from some of the group feel typical of a postdocoral research position
Headquarters seems to be extremely removed from the field. They have an old-time idea when it comes to reach.
For a company that values in-person interaction, they tend to have terrible locations. Nobody wants to live in Wilmington DE, Ohio or Indiana. Talking to European colleagues, it sounds like they also chose very unappealing locations in Europe as well. I love the company and the work I do. I really like my coworkers. I still can't picture myself here long term, because the locations are just awful. It's also strange that job function is not considered with any discussion around remote work. Most people in my role go to the office to sit on calls for most of the day. We literally do not work with anyone in the building. Yet, we are required to be in the building 3 days a week.
Great industry experience for post docs but transitioning to senior scientist within the company is difficult.
Only offers to green card or citizen
After 5 years I don’t have a con… it is a great company
Can't think of none right now.
-They want people with 5 years of marketing vs diverse functional experience within industry - HR doesn't care and will always side with management
The hours can sometimes be long, 50 hour weeks were the norm.
Low visibility, lots of layers of hierarchy, few opportunities for growth
Company and global teams seem siloed leading to inefficiency.
Management can be disorganized at times
difficult hours to manage on the workdays
Conservative intermediate management, not open to exploring
excessive complexity inability for individuals to make a decision no autonomy Poor communications
However, the constant turn over of senior leaders creates a very unstable working environment as employees are always in a state of flux and reorganization. Additionally, while the company appears to outwardly promote diversity of thought the culture does not truly support differing points of view and this tends to thrwart the ""speak up"" culture so aspired. If there was some consistency in leadership, I think this could be improved.
Nothing to add that’s negative
Change the programs, weird ladder
None literally there are no cons
Too much work and not enough people.
i don't have anything to add
Lots of meetings Bureaucratic In person requirements aren’t logical
Turnovers some toxic working culture... Compensation packages are some of the lowest in the industry

Nothing to share re negatives.
May come across toxic people sometimes
None that I can think of.
Shocked at the approach and rationale to force people in the office- threat to remove bonus if you work from home. Constant talk about how important wellbeing is but the workload is always impossible and the inflexible working from home policy makes work life balance for those who live further away completely unachievable on top of the very high workload which already means everyone is working overtime.
Nothing really, fast paced and sometimes need to do weekend work but can flex hours
Can't think of none right now.
None that I can think of
-They want people with 5 years of marketing vs diverse functional experience within industry - HR doesn't care and will always side with management
not that enough salary for me
There can be a lot of complexity to work through at times.
