Upper management and owners form cliques that exclude those who don’t eat time. They ignore the lack of talent and are ok with producing inferior deliverables rather than investing in employee technical training. Attrition rate is very high. They pretend that busy seasons are more manageable than they really are and employees are unwilling to express that they are overworked and don’t know how to do their jobs. The schedule can be a bit much some years. Low pay sector and country I have no downside as of the moment Corporate cares less about how well each hotel is functioning and more about how much money it makes. Corporate emails and correspondence are often not up to the standard I would hold myself to, if I was in a position where the majority of my job was doing paperwork and sending emails. The little guys who run the hotel end up earning the vast majority of the money for the corporation, but corporate doesn't really care about the quality of life for those employees. Hotels are constantly understaffed because they refuse to hire at an acceptable wage, especially for the cheaper hotel brands. Salaries employees are expected and often asked to work extra hours at the hotel and not receive overtime compensation. Task force department is almost a complete joke; the vast majority of their team don't understand the hotels when they're assigned to them, and do a shoddy job at management even when their help is desperately needed. Our location sorely needs a complete renovation but there is no hope of that happening; any work around here is done for cheap, resulting in low quality. Obviously this creates problems for both guests and the staff, who are all trying to do the best with what they've been given. I hate to be that person who blames all their problems on corporate, but I've never seen a more hands off corporate franchise. Their approach to running our property has essentially just been a waiting game to see if we sink or float. Makes me wonder what the point of being a part of their franchise even is none none none none none There are no cons.

Pay is very subpar compared to the market, regardless of the locale Limited growth opportunities if you are on the US side, as there are few US only teams and each US team reports up to a Canadian. Very Chicago / Midwest centric if you are in the US. Good luck if you are a CA employee as they don't really care about growing in CA - they acquired Bank of the West so they could cut expenses by eliminating corporate jobs in high cost of living areas. Absolutely no communication from upper management. Bad market time right now High pressure sales resulting in late hours and not reward for hitting goals. Your success will solely live on who your manager is and how good he or she can run the location. Each location was run in a way different ways. The best manager I worked with is running the entire district to keep motivation and sales high. The industry that i personally am working in is not my favorite. targets and weekly follow ups No clear path for advancementnot that I can think of Nothing really, maybe technology but you can still get the job done. 10/10 company.

Absolutely no communication from upper management. Bad market time right now High pressure sales resulting in late hours and not reward for hitting goals. Your success will solely live on who your manager is and how good he or she can run the location. Each location was run in a way different ways.

Hybrid is 4 days in office with Monday's mandatory. Remote work is offered inconsistently. Most days in the office I would be on Teams calls with people working remotely and hardly interact with anyone. Being in the office was a waste of time and money as I was forced to commute. Republic Services has awful work life balance and it's going to be even worse when they force more people coming into the office in September. they tell you what you want to hear they can't keep employees low pay for what you do .if you like to work overtime only way to make ok money until they cut out the overtime. if you like pms good places to work the top rate guys is the rate pm guys make at most shop that pay a good wage You will be provided scripts to de-escalate customers who were especially not serviced, or incorrectly invoiced but the bottom-line is that you're passing the buck as nothing is often going to be done or if so, just a temporary fix. Lucky to get an increase more than one percent The pay could be better Treated awful! I worked for JRM for years. Republic bought them out. They cut our pay 38% but told us not to worry, the 1st year we will get bonuses (as long as we stay) that will keep us at the pay we were used to. I got the 1st bonus (few hundred dollars). Never got the others. I inquired and was told I was not eligle because I worked overtime. My overtime pay did not touch what I was used to making. I spoke w/upper management and was offered a lateral move to sales. (I wanted nothing to do w/that). I can't make my mortgage payments. There goes college for my daughter. Nothing but lies. And, we went from great (free) health insurance to expensive and awful insurance. Mail order pharmacy only. My daughter never got her meds on time. My wife was on the phone daily fighting them.

Only allowed a minimum number of unscheduled PTO days before corrective action. Health insurance is pricy and does not offer many options. Tuition assistance requires you to be employed for 12 months prior to enrollment, and employed for 24 months after reimbursement to avoid repayment; graduate studies are only covered if your job is at a certain grade or higher and have 2 years with the company. Too many and outdated systems (8 that I can think off the top of my head for Retail Banking) that make it difficult to perform in the role. Making incentive can be very difficult as it is weighted and based off of historical data. Senior management seems very out of touch with their employees. During housing crisis, we kept being told that ""we're doing great. Our jobs are secure"" but then a couple weeks later, they transferred many people to customer service positions more than once. We went from 150+ inbound officers to 38 in one year. They did not adjust commissions to match the market either, so many of us were not reaching sales tiers to be paid commissions. M&T is slow to act, even with technology and the systems we use. I had to put my dog down of 13 years and when I called to ask if I can use bereavement for the days I took off grieving, the HR agent chuckled and said pets were not covered. It also was not as easy as it should have been to get break times for pumping breastmilk for my daughter which is covered by federal law. - The organization is still under both Digital and Design transformation, so it can be difficult to show up and assume your stakeholders a) understand the value of design; and b) understand how to collaborate/leverage design in appropriate ways - There isn't a fully structured job architecture in place within the Design capability. This means that if you're entering a level that is not structured fully, it may be a challenge to get promoted properly - The organization is known for not giving raises or appropriately compensating existing talent based comparative with industry standards, especially related to Design and CX capabilities The job is tedious and the quarterly requirements need to be addressed. If you get a bad branch, be prepared. If you get a good branch, you're in great shape. The raises are not very much at all, if you do actually get a raise. Little career mobility from the platform, your options are limited to working up to branch manager, or focus on the sales side with insurance or mortgages. All back office roles were in Buffalo or Delaware Didn't feel like they want you to use the company as a springboard to other careers. Very difficult to get experience in other roles other than day to day branch operations. When applying to a job here, they question you if your background shows you have only been at your job for 2-3 years, expecting 'loyalty' Seem to think that what works in Buffalo works in NJ/NY when that is not always the case. Pay was not great, though that is more a problem with the industry as a whole rather than M&T (disclaimer: the above is based on work in 2020 before a large restructure, some of these may have improved) Perks stalled into 2022.

Comradery. Nothing. After 20 years they have turned a career into a thankless, day to day job. -Pay is usually pretty good","Hard work, late nights, stress So many.... hard to know where to start. I think the worst ones are; 1) Spend more time in hotels than at home, I think they actually try to make this happen. 2) Company treats you like a liability instead of a person. 3) I've seen people get hurt and Management was worried about getting the train out on time than getting someone medical help. 4) the union doesn't care either. The local reps are fine but nationally they are completely in the company pocket. -A lot of nights, weekends, sleepless nights expecting a call to go to work. The on call life can be a bit taxing but for those that are up for it, there’s a great loving here. -Trains move on weekends and holidays which means it’s very likely you’ll work most weekends and holidays. -Leadership was absolutely horrible when I was there but I’ve heard they’ve lightened up significantly. If that’s true, it takes this job to another level and would be very intriguing for most. -A bit volatile due to constant layoffs. Tenure is everything and the first 5 years or so can be rough because you have too little seniority On call is kind of tricky getting used to at first. Promotions are based largely on cronyism. If you don’t have someone to promote you, your career will stagnate. End of the year compensation is not based on objective measures but rather on your relationship with and what you are willing to keep your mouth shut about. Ethics- the company has a way of putting lip stick on a pig when it comes to ethics. They will do whatever it takes to protect the chosen employees and their lack of ethics (eg- cutting corners on safety- production overall, covering up incidents, and the toxic work environment. This creates a wild west mentality in which decisions are made to enhance the upward mobility of individuals careers for some while others lower employees in the organization will take the blame. Lack of senior management accountability- It is a very kiss up beat down environment. No time off, unscheduled work at beginning of career, on call, out of town, no opportunity for advance since the UP let all the managers go. No job security in recent years No job security, no matter what your position. From Janitor to CEO. Do what they want to employees or customers because ""what are you going to do about it?"" is the general attitude. This company is going to fail. They are hiring, promoting and compensating based on age and minority status instead of experience and skill. Mark this review. Union Pacific will implode and sink just like the Ocean Gate sub because they are aligning with the same business model to meet ESG rating goals. UP will be bought and controlled by a foreign investment group by 2030 if they continue the self destructive behavior. The “How Matters” is the ethics credo that only applies when the executives and Board want it to apply. Union Pacific has two blatant standards of ethics and policy just like our justice system and government. - Every couple of years - massive layoffs in the name of profit - Employees treated as commodity (you are just a FTE, always on the chopping block if the share price dips) - not much appreciation for skills - all employees 'interchangeable' managementHard work, late nights, stress So many.... hard to know where to start.

I don't really have a whole lot right now Was screamed at across the office by the office manager for talking to another assistant (about a patients case), was told they would have given me a five star review at my annual review but were required to find something to improve (ie: very minimal raises), often times the assistants run 2-4 chairs at any given time because they are constantly squeezing things into the schedule to make more money — even if all assistants are already racing about trying to stay on top of it all. Will not accept no as an answer when adding patients. There was barely enough time to clean the rooms as thoroughly as possible. Hygienist gets a bonus for her production and it is rumored that she “pushes the probe” for higher perio readings (therefore more scaling and root planing and more antibiotic usage at over 150 a pop. People were often quoted for five thousand+ dollar cleanings) Company sold you on this idea that you would get the chance to move up if you only worked hard enough. Sent me in for training for an Assistant manager role and never bothered to follow through. Regional manager invented mistakes that I had made in order to come up with reasons as to why I couldn't advance. The truth of the matter was, there were no openings and management did not want to raise my pay. Depressing work environment, disorganization, the schedule was always over packed and management and had zero empathy for how slammed myself and the front and back office were. Phone ringing off the hook non stop due to angry clients calling in because they were not getting any response from us since we were too overwhelmed with work to have the time to answer. When I broke the news of my leaving and gave my two weeks notice, dentist refused to look me in the eye and coldly told me that they would not need me and I could leave. I bent over backward for the company. Waste of time and money. They dont care about you as a person any more all they see you as a dollar sign. The Regional manager told me straight out her mom she not friendly/family oriented she her to do her job and go home. NO work life balance and will not work around your school schedule so if you are a student do not apply! They POP allows the Director to talk to you any kind of way and if you stand up for yourself you will get fired FYI! Training extremely fast, tell you if you're the type of person who takes notes and learn the material that way it's going to slow you down, don't take the time to ask if you know how to do certain functions in the computer they just assume you do, trainer went so fast over the material that it was hard to keep up ket alone learn it, don't let you know that you are going to be put in a chat with the supervisor and let you know that this may not be for you (want you to quit instead of fire you) so it doesn't look bad on them, supervisor tells you to take time to learn more about the computer system and when the position opens up again to reapply, take the advice given and reapply only to find out they have made it to where you can never be hired again, flat out lie to you and waste your time, HORRIBLE COMPANY It depends 100% on who the doctor is in the practice whether or not you will enjoy your job. I initially worked for a controlling drama queen who was proud of her “mean girls” and she has zero interest in staff wor/life balance. My most recent office was pretty wonderful because of the doctor and co-workers but upper management RM in both locations seemed lost and inconsistent. I still don’t know what is the point of the regional manager. . He basically says what they tell him to, nothing more or less. He also speaks the opinions of the owner who lacks basic respect for other humans. So the rm told me my work is easy and the cases I’m doing were handed to me. If he had to do half of my job in a day he wouldn’t say such awful and demeaning things. This is all to say insstead of, good job. He doesn’t know how to value people. I don’t know where they found him but he is basically their soundbox, a puppet for aspen dental management. He has no opinion of his own. The owner thinks he’s running a slave operation. We’re in America ok? We have labor rights and we deserve to know how we’re paid. And he thinks he’s a god when it comes to dentistry but he can’t diagnose a simple cavity. Aspen doesn’t know how to tell their owners how to treat people correctly. He basically told me I’m useless and I don’t know anything. On my first day. He knows how to kill anyone’s self esteem. Arestin. You will be sick with he many patients needs arestin. It’s completely useless and they pedal it like it’s pez candy. It is completely useless. Manager is toxic and creates a toxic work environment. Morning huddles are usually ego based. Talking nonsense on previous employees and her doctors. Found them to be very unnecessary. Lack of professionalism from management. And others. Long hours worked. Sometimes left at office with all closing duties. Manager never deals with the problems of office. Certain employees are disrespectful. Items stolen from office. Items missing for patients. Treatments not quoted, never explained procedures to patients causing more work for da. Understaffed so you take on more responsibilities with no pay raise. Patients are left at end of day with no consults. Then get mad at the da left behind. Da is left to deal with patient problems. Drama created by certain employees. Hmmmmm… there are so many !, I hate to ruin all the surprises for new hires! no raises….a trillion new patients daily thanks to the ever diligent call center folks (sarcasm btw)… work 11 hr days = poor work like balance …. High turnover rate for DA,s and front office… short staffed 365 days a year… and then after you put up with all that, mgmt /corporate is always there to let you know how much you and your office failed your patients and provided substandard treatment and care because your numbers were not were THEY decided they should be at. Oh and it’s all about the credit apps, just in case you didn’t know. Lol.. And then the cycle repeats itself. PEACE I’M OUT!advancement in the company can take a long time to achieve.

Hygienist gets a bonus for her production and it is rumored that she “pushes the probe” for higher perio readings (therefore more scaling and root planing and more antibiotic usage at over 150 a pop. People were often quoted for five thousand+ dollar cleanings) Company sold you on this idea that you would get the chance to move up if you only worked hard enough. Sent me in for training for an Assistant manager role and never bothered to follow through. Regional manager invented mistakes that I had made in order to come up with reasons as to why I couldn't advance. The truth of the matter was, there were no openings and management did not want to raise my pay. Depressing work environment, disorganization, the schedule was always over packed and management and had zero empathy for how slammed myself and the front and back office were. Phone ringing off the hook non stop due to angry clients calling in because they were not getting any response from us since we were too overwhelmed with work to have the time to answer. When I broke the news of my leaving and gave my two weeks notice, dentist refused to look me in the eye and coldly told me that they would not need me and I could leave. I bent over backward for the company. Waste of time and money. It depends 100% on who the doctor is in the practice whether or not you will enjoy your job. I initially worked for a controlling drama queen who was proud of her “mean girls” and she has zero interest in staff wor/life balance. My most recent office was pretty wonderful because of the doctor and co-workers but upper management RM in both locations seemed lost and inconsistent. Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing No work life balance. The office region that I worked for was a mess. I could rarely take a day off. They dont care about you as a person any more all they see you as a dollar sign. The Regional manager told me straight out her mom she not friendly/family oriented she her to do her job and go home. NO work life balance and will not work around your school schedule so if you are a student do not apply! They POP allows the Director to talk to you any kind of way and if you stand up for yourself you will get fired FYI! So basically we are there to just schedule appointments for people who call. Sounds easy right? No, for minimum pay we are in a sales position. The training made it seem simple, just get their information and get them scheduled in for a day. Nope, we have no idea about any insurances so we have to force them into an appointment without knowing if their insurance will cover the procedure or without any pricing for most procedures. We have numbers we are forced to stay on top of, but they don’t filter out existing patients, Spanish calls, or spam calls so it just affects negatively when we get those. There’s also “special lines” that some people get to increase their numbers while some of us get tons of existing patients or offices with zero availability . We’re praised if our numbers are “up”, but scolded if they are down, even if we can’t control the type of calls we get or the availability of the office. Also constantly yelled at by patients because our website advertises “same day treatment” so when we can’t promise them that, they get very upset. We’re also taking calls on the weekends even though they aren’t open, they have their phone number linked to an “24/7 urgent care” office in hopes of getting the 4 appointments scheduled out of the 200 calls of people needing Saturday/Sunday availability which 89% of the offices don’t offer. I was yelled at for their false advertising every weekend. Easy job, but ridiculous expectations. Training extremely fast, tell you if you're the type of person who takes notes and learn the material that way it's going to slow you down, don't take the time to ask if you know how to do certain functions in the computer they just assume you do, trainer went so fast over the material that it was hard to keep up ket alone learn it, don't let you know that you are going to be put in a chat with the supervisor and let you know that this may not be for you (want you to quit instead of fire you) so it doesn't look bad on them, supervisor tells you to take time to learn more about the computer system and when the position opens up again to reapply, take the advice given and reapply only to find out they have made it to where you can never be hired again, flat out lie to you and waste your time, HORRIBLE COMPANYadvancement in the company can take a long time to achieve.

NO work life balance and will not work around your school schedule so if you are a student do not apply! They POP allows the Director to talk to you any kind of way and if you stand up for yourself you will get fired FYI! Training extremely fast, tell you if you're the type of person who takes notes and learn the material that way it's going to slow you down, don't take the time to ask if you know how to do certain functions in the computer they just assume you do, trainer went so fast over the material that it was hard to keep up ket alone learn it, don't let you know that you are going to be put in a chat with the supervisor and let you know that this may not be for you (want you to quit instead of fire you) so it doesn't look bad on them, supervisor tells you to take time to learn more about the computer system and when the position opens up again to reapply, take the advice given and reapply only to find out they have made it to where you can never be hired again, flat out lie to you and waste your time, HORRIBLE COMPANY It depends 100% on who the doctor is in the practice whether or not you will enjoy your job. I initially worked for a controlling drama queen who was proud of her “mean girls” and she has zero interest in staff wor/life balance. My most recent office was pretty wonderful because of the doctor and co-workers but upper management RM in both locations seemed lost and inconsistent. I still don’t know what is the point of the regional manager. . He basically says what they tell him to, nothing more or less. He also speaks the opinions of the owner who lacks basic respect for other humans. So the rm told me my work is easy and the cases I’m doing were handed to me. If he had to do half of my job in a day he wouldn’t say such awful and demeaning things. This is all to say insstead of, good job. He doesn’t know how to value people. I don’t know where they found him but he is basically their soundbox, a puppet for aspen dental management. He has no opinion of his own. The owner thinks he’s running a slave operation. We’re in America ok? We have labor rights and we deserve to know how we’re paid. And he thinks he’s a god when it comes to dentistry but he can’t diagnose a simple cavity. Aspen doesn’t know how to tell their owners how to treat people correctly. He basically told me I’m useless and I don’t know anything. On my first day. He knows how to kill anyone’s self esteem. Arestin. You will be sick with he many patients needs arestin. It’s completely useless and they pedal it like it’s pez candy. It is completely useless. Manager is toxic and creates a toxic work environment. Morning huddles are usually ego based. Talking nonsense on previous employees and her doctors. Found them to be very unnecessary. Lack of professionalism from management. And others. Long hours worked. Sometimes left at office with all closing duties. Manager never deals with the problems of office. Certain employees are disrespectful. Items stolen from office. Items missing for patients. Treatments not quoted, never explained procedures to patients causing more work for da. Understaffed so you take on more responsibilities with no pay raise. Patients are left at end of day with no consults. Then get mad at the da left behind. Da is left to deal with patient problems. Drama created by certain employees. Hmmmmm… there are so many !, I hate to ruin all the surprises for new hires! no raises….a trillion new patients daily thanks to the ever diligent call center folks (sarcasm btw)… work 11 hr days = poor work like balance …. High turnover rate for DA,s and front office… short staffed 365 days a year… and then after you put up with all that, mgmt /corporate is always there to let you know how much you and your office failed your patients and provided substandard treatment and care because your numbers were not were THEY decided they should be at. Oh and it’s all about the credit apps, just in case you didn’t know. Lol.. And then the cycle repeats itself. PEACE I’M OUT!advancement in the company can take a long time to achieve. No cons to be honest Was screamed at across the office by the office manager for talking to another assistant (about a patients case), was told they would have given me a five star review at my annual review but were required to find something to improve (ie: very minimal raises), often times the assistants run 2-4 chairs at any given time because they are constantly squeezing things into the schedule to make more money — even if all assistants are already racing about trying to stay on top of it all. Will not accept no as an answer when adding patients. There was barely enough time to clean the rooms as thoroughly as possible. Hygienist gets a bonus for her production and it is rumored that she “pushes the probe” for higher perio readings (therefore more scaling and root planing and more antibiotic usage at over 150 a pop. People were often quoted for five thousand+ dollar cleanings) Company sold you on this idea that you would get the chance to move up if you only worked hard enough. Sent me in for training for an Assistant manager role and never bothered to follow through. Regional manager invented mistakes that I had made in order to come up with reasons as to why I couldn't advance. The truth of the matter was, there were no openings and management did not want to raise my pay. Depressing work environment, disorganization, the schedule was always over packed and management and had zero empathy for how slammed myself and the front and back office were. Phone ringing off the hook non stop due to angry clients calling in because they were not getting any response from us since we were too overwhelmed with work to have the time to answer. When I broke the news of my leaving and gave my two weeks notice, dentist refused to look me in the eye and coldly told me that they would not need me and I could leave. I bent over backward for the company. Waste of time and money. It depends 100% on who the doctor is in the practice whether or not you will enjoy your job. I initially worked for a controlling drama queen who was proud of her “mean girls” and she has zero interest in staff wor/life balance. My most recent office was pretty wonderful because of the doctor and co-workers but upper management RM in both locations seemed lost and inconsistent. No work life balance. The office region that I worked for was a mess. I could rarely take a day off. They dont care about you as a person any more all they see you as a dollar sign. The Regional manager told me straight out her mom she not friendly/family oriented she her to do her job and go home. NO work life balance and will not work around your school schedule so if you are a student do not apply! They POP allows the Director to talk to you any kind of way and if you stand up for yourself you will get fired FYI! So basically we are there to just schedule appointments for people who call. Sounds easy right? No, for minimum pay we are in a sales position. The training made it seem simple, just get their information and get them scheduled in for a day. Nope, we have no idea about any insurances so we have to force them into an appointment without knowing if their insurance will cover the procedure or without any pricing for most procedures. We have numbers we are forced to stay on top of, but they don’t filter out existing patients, Spanish calls, or spam calls so it just affects negatively when we get those. There’s also “special lines” that some people get to increase their numbers while some of us get tons of existing patients or offices with zero availability . We’re praised if our numbers are “up”, but scolded if they are down, even if we can’t control the type of calls we get or the availability of the office. Also constantly yelled at by patients because our website advertises “same day treatment” so when we can’t promise them that, they get very upset. We’re also taking calls on the weekends even though they aren’t open, they have their phone number linked to an “24/7 urgent care” office in hopes of getting the 4 appointments scheduled out of the 200 calls of people needing Saturday/Sunday availability which 89% of the offices don’t offer. I was yelled at for their false advertising every weekend. Easy job, but ridiculous expectations.

Once these holidays pass, the hours will lighten up as well as work load, so expect about 8-15 hrs per week on average.. which may be a bit too light of hours for some part-time job seekers. Job may not have a lot of potential for growth in some areas, while offered easily in others. (ie: going from Merchandiser to setup/install team). Hard to effect change, very focused on legacy/senority not necessarily qualification. Very little accountability for all. Equipment and technology leaves a lot to be desired. Pay could be assed for sure! Since the COVID shutdown, the company has moved to more remote and hybrid roles, reducing the workforce and streamlining operations. With far fewer employees in the building on a given day, it's not nearly the same close-knit work environment it used to be. And the repeated downsizings have pared back the workforce considerably, so it's not the creative powerhouse it once was. Low pay even for a rehire, some weeks only 8 hours, holiday time not more than 14-16 hours. A lot of contradicting instruction by Territory Supervisor. One week you’ll be told you can do something a certain way the next your being reprimanded for doing it that way. For example, you plan your store visits according to when shipments arrive but then are reprimanded to visit the store on the day before your shipments come in. Or that as the holidays approach you can go in later when it’s much less busy and out of the customer’s way but then reprimanded for going in after the store’s Receiver leaves for the day. The owner is the biggest con. He has done shady things. We were told we're not allowed to discuss pay, which they still tell new hires, but this is illegal. We also discovered they were underpaying a woman who has been working there for over 20 years. They were paying her $8/hour. When she realized she was underpaid and the manager helped her get her pay up to $10/hour, they cut her hours. It also turns out she had the highest sales of all the employees. This left a bad impression on me. They don't offer any benefits outside of the in-store discount. The owner has made more bad impressions on top of this, such as giving us a $20 in-store coupon for our record sales during the Christmas season, thanking a retiring store manager, who worked for the company for over 20 years, with a Jim Shore she already owned, and taking the time to meet me and say hi for the first time after working there for almost a year. - Customers can be frustrating at times, as in all retail positions Lots of down time and working with public You are not well trained. You receive about 2 weeks virtual training but it’s not really thorough. Very tedious and can be a lot of stress on your back. Heavy lifting at times . Decreased hours .

With far fewer employees in the building on a given day, it's not nearly the same close-knit work environment it used to be. And the repeated downsizings have pared back the workforce considerably, so it's not the creative powerhouse it once was. Hard to effect change, very focused on legacy/senority not necessarily qualification. Very little accountability for all. Equipment and technology leaves a lot to be desired. Pay could be assed for sure! Low pay even for a rehire, some weeks only 8 hours, holiday time not more than 14-16 hours. A lot of contradicting instruction by Territory Supervisor. One week you’ll be told you can do something a certain way the next your being reprimanded for doing it that way. For example, you plan your store visits according to when shipments arrive but then are reprimanded to visit the store on the day before your shipments come in. Or that as the holidays approach you can go in later when it’s much less busy and out of the customer’s way but then reprimanded for going in after the store’s Receiver leaves for the day. The owner is the biggest con. He has done shady things. We were told we're not allowed to discuss pay, which they still tell new hires, but this is illegal. We also discovered they were underpaying a woman who has been working there for over 20 years. They were paying her $8/hour. When she realized she was underpaid and the manager helped her get her pay up to $10/hour, they cut her hours. It also turns out she had the highest sales of all the employees. This left a bad impression on me. They don't offer any benefits outside of the in-store discount. The owner has made more bad impressions on top of this, such as giving us a $20 in-store coupon for our record sales during the Christmas season, thanking a retiring store manager, who worked for the company for over 20 years, with a Jim Shore she already owned, and taking the time to meet me and say hi for the first time after working there for almost a year. - Customers can be frustrating at times, as in all retail positions Lots of down time and working with public Heavy lifting at times . Decreased hours . Hard on body (back), low pay Not too many cons, enjoyed my timeNot really a con, but you will get more hours and busy schedule requests during Holiday times of December - April, which is Christmas, Valentines' Day, and Mother's Day. Once these holidays pass, the hours will lighten up as well as work load, so expect about 8-15 hrs per week on average.. which may be a bit too light of hours for some part-time job seekers.

Management is friendly. The management team is trained very well on leadership and motivated their staff. The emails got you excited to work and be involved. Remote work is always great and creating your own schedule was also a perk. I've worked in all types of companies, big and small, and in many industries. Nothing compares to Stitch Fix! It is absolutely the best place to work, especially for women. Most companies falsely tout work life balance, but SFIX truly lives it. I kinda got scolded (very nicely) by a manager for scheduling one of her teammates for a call at 5 pm, saying that was too late. The name Stitch Fix is well known for its customer service, quality & prices. This company offers a very needed service for people that have very little time to shop or simply doesn’t like to shop. The postage free envelope to return makes returns easier to do. I loved working for Stitch Fix - a supportive work environment with flexibility to create your own schedule and great benefits.

His impact to cdk is the equivalent of the icebergs impact on the Titanic. He was fired from cdk when it was a public company because he had cut the staff down so severely that the company could not support its customers or create any new products. The ceo was hired back because the new owners know nothing about leading a software company as they are a real estate investment company and he sold them a bunch of lies on what he could do. He is running the same and only playbook he knows how to run which is cut costs and drive minimal growth. Most of the talent has left cdk already. The leaders the ceo has hired are inept lemmings who are following his commands. The customers are already aware of this as are the competitors and both are taking appropriate actions as a result. In the end, the ceo will cut the organization to the bare bones and he will receive his very large incentive package as will his direct staff. For the people remaining they will be left with unhappy customers and a staff that can not support their needs. Run away from CDK. Do not believe anything their recruiters tell you.

Many times new hires come and are not told how to reach their percentages for the company. There are continuous write ups but no corrective measures on how to fix the issue. There are no guides lines that show how to reach your said percentage goal per week nor is there anything that shows you that via training. There is a 30 minute training on a pallet jack that has caused MANY injuries bc the training is NOT thorough. The only experience we get to understand how to hit the percentage is by a simple drive through each department (freezer,cool,dry) on a pallet jack and maybe 2 days with a trainer, who may or may not want to be there to train you that day.

New hires will never get that from someone that is currently making $33 an hour while trying to reach new habits that are $19 an hour and are safe to show a progression. Increasing production 5% per week would be fair IF guidelines were in place to show a new hire how to make the progression with the tools available to them. Last thing, if the probationary period is 90 days, the company should invest in those 90 days with each person to show them culture of the company. Most are getting fired in 60-70 days before they reach the end of the period, which is cool bc the company can hire day/night workers to cover them without no true liability to the company….another story, another time.

There is no training. They lie to you and tell you full time is a minimum of 35 hours, then schedule you 30 hours saying that’s full time status. They hire management that has ZERO grocery experience. Just because they have ‘retail’ experience, does not mean they have what it takes to run a grocery store. The store manager likes to hide the legal state posters about right to work and equal opportunities. So if you want your worker rights violated, work here. If you want to work with a store manager who can’t be bothered to work 40 hours a week since they live 90 minutes from the store. I love working for managers who just sit on their phone all day, make people stop working on projects, so they can do the work the store manager doesn’t want to. Come to work tired, go sleep under the bulk bins or in the bathroom! The amount of time theft and employee theft if awful. Department managers sell out dated and bad meat from the meat department. This company is awful as a whole, STAY AWAY AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. If you like working with racists and misandrist, this is the company for you! If you want to waste your time and be gaslighted, this is the company for you! Literally any issue that can possibly occur (while you’re on leave/vacation or just not in that day) they will scream at you and threaten your job every chance they get. I was out on medical leave for over a month and inventory numbers came back. ASM and my assistant manager, did all the numbers and I did inventory before I left and it was great. I come back to a write up because while I was gone the numbers were off by like 5k. I get I’m the manager and I’m responsible for all, but not while on medical leave. My boss screamed at people for trying to contact me but when the numbers came back for the month I was gone, it’s my fault 🤦‍♀️ They will call you all day everyday just to scream at you because someone in another department didn’t transfer over products or literally any other reason to prevent you from having any type of life outside of work, yet they “pride” themselves on having a great work/life balance. It’s just sad really. Lack of flexibility, short and few breaks (you only get 2 breaks maximum, no matter how many hours), rude coworkers, most of the coworkers are old and will disrespect younger employees, management doesn't care how you feel. The pay is crap for an upscale grocery store. Publix pays more The pay is far far too low Long hours sometimes Snooty customer base Kids would disrespect the bathroom Very fast paced and managers aren’t lenient management low pay slow days no work life balance Managers/company do not value employees (their time, work ethic/contributions, safety, physical/emotional well-being) -Managers allow sexual harassment, verbal abuse, manipulation, and constant discord in departments (especially from department managers). This is primarily because they do not respond to complaints if they think the person causing the issue will go to HR. -Managers overlook employees who: do not put in the work, create continual conflict, do not show up for their shifts (or who show up out of uniform), work unsafely/in violation of health code or company policy, or continually ""misplace"" company money - and they overlook them for YEARS on end before firing them, even if they have been written up dozens of times. I have seen them promote these people and leave their good employees without a raise for over a year. -You have to request your raises the majority of the time. -The management plays favorites continually, and it is usually without basis in the employee's work ethic. -Constant violations of health code. -Constant pressure to come in while sick or unavailable. -Constantly being scheduled over your availability, or put in other departments you are not supposed to work. Being the only person in the department means a lot of work can be your responsibilityDon’t do your job and you’ll be thrown out The store manager lets people come into work drunk.

My boss screamed at people for trying to contact me but when the numbers came back for the month I was gone, it’s my fault 🤦‍♀️ They will call you all day everyday just to scream at you because someone in another department didn’t transfer over products or literally any other reason to prevent you from having any type of life outside of work, yet they “pride” themselves on having a great work/life balance. It’s just sad really. Lack of flexibility, short and few breaks (you only get 2 breaks maximum, no matter how many hours), rude coworkers, most of the coworkers are old and will disrespect younger employees, management doesn't care how you feel. The pay is crap for an upscale grocery store. Publix pays more The pay is far far too low Long hours sometimes Snooty customer base Kids would disrespect the bathroom Very fast paced and managers aren’t lenient management low pay slow days no work life balance Managers/company do not value employees (their time, work ethic/contributions, safety, physical/emotional well-being) -Managers allow sexual harassment, verbal abuse, manipulation, and constant discord in departments (especially from department managers). This is primarily because they do not respond to complaints if they think the person causing the issue will go to HR. -Managers overlook employees who: do not put in the work, create continual conflict, do not show up for their shifts (or who show up out of uniform), work unsafely/in violation of health code or company policy, or continually ""misplace"" company money - and they overlook them for YEARS on end before firing them, even if they have been written up dozens of times. I have seen them promote these people and leave their good employees without a raise for over a year. -You have to request your raises the majority of the time. -The management plays favorites continually, and it is usually without basis in the employee's work ethic. -Constant violations of health code. -Constant pressure to come in while sick or unavailable. -Constantly being scheduled over your availability, or put in other departments you are not supposed to work. Being the only person in the department means a lot of work can be your responsibilityDon’t do your job and you’ll be thrown out The store manager lets people come into work drunk. There is no training. They lie to you and tell you full time is a minimum of 35 hours, then schedule you 30 hours saying that’s full time status. They hire management that has ZERO grocery experience. Just because they have ‘retail’ experience, does not mean they have what it takes to run a grocery store. The store manager likes to hide the legal state posters about right to work and equal opportunities. So if you want your worker rights violated, work here. If you want to work with a store manager who can’t be bothered to work 40 hours a week since they live 90 minutes from the store. I love working for managers who just sit on their phone all day, make people stop working on projects, so they can do the work the store manager doesn’t want to. Come to work tired, go sleep under the bulk bins or in the bathroom! The amount of time theft and employee theft if awful. Department managers sell out dated and bad meat from the meat department. This company is awful as a whole, STAY AWAY AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. If you like working with racists and misandrist, this is the company for you! If you want to waste your time and be gaslighted, this is the company for you! Literally any issue that can possibly occur (while you’re on leave/vacation or just not in that day) they will scream at you and threaten your job every chance they get.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lenovo-Reviews-E8034.htm,"Awesome team, great job and experience. As a lower tier technology company with aspirations, and even Chinese government-driven incentive, for transforming itself into a technology leader, there is a lot of opportunity for driving improvement.

Also have a tone of executive exposure Good work life balance Good benefits Rewarded appropriately Innovation of the latest tech products","Can be subject to market volatility. For those in North America working close to or within IT, worklife balance is difficult because IT is predominantly based in China. This results in regular meetings in the morning and evening. For those working closer to or even with business, your work will be more influenced by local needs, so worklife balance is easier to achieve. Pay could’ve been better but good for straight of college individuals -Salary is not competitive, with a lot of red tape for merit raises. -Siloed workflows -Not much room for promotion within your organization Focus changes quite frequently. Hard to stay on task sometimes Very disorganized in the technical organizations, company works off of very tight budgets making it difficult to get additional perks such as being financed to travel to conferences, being financed for certifications. The only way the company will pay for certification is if its a part of your IDP/KPIs which is ridiculous. Lots of internal politics to deal with Not allowed to give your professional opinions on decisions Some upper management has ""family issues"" that they speak regularly about in board meetings Difficult to get the tools you need to get the job done correctly Has to be full time which is less than ideal for this type of holdover job. Work pretty late so it’s pretty exhausted Lenovo seems to have forgotten who it was as they try to become Dell. As they have pushed to become services-led, they have let the hardware/device side of the house languish. There is very little left of what it means to develop commercial devices in the context of the customer and the rest of the portfolio, and the people who care are being pushed out.Can be subject to market volatility.

American management team implemented a disruptive reorg that did not solve for our issues (inefficient processes, sub-standard operational departments, client service team members being responsible for too many accounts) and in some cases exacerbated our challenges (needlessly complex structure, too many unnecessary emails & IMs, too much time wasted in meetings). The MO this year seems to be focused on what they can take away from us (bonus targets cut in half, Friday afternoons off prior to most holidays eliminated, peer recognition program watered down, people management responsibilities taken away from a lot of employees). The reorg created a large segment of demoralized Skale 80 employees placed in roles that our CEO said would be classified as Skale 70 as team members left. No clear path to growth. Kantar lies to candidates and employees about their initiatives to promote and grow your career at the company. Kantar's executives have to say this to keep their numbers high, hoping for a Bain Capital fund injection or an IPO.

It's a terrible work environment and the CSuite Execs in NYC are the poorest of leaders in the business. All smoke and mirrors. Long hours, low pay, poor leadership, high CEO turnover Slow-turning wheels with a very defined hierarchy so upward movement is tough. I personally have had a very strong career at Kantar changing roles and moving countries with opportunities to work in the UK, then China and now in the USA. I've been promoted a number of times and feel that my work is very valued. However I'd say that the formal career management isn't great - in my experience you have to ask for the roles you want and, if you're good at what you do, the company makes it happen. In fact I was able to create my current role from scratch as it previously didn't exist. So take control of your own career at Kantar and don't expect the next great role to be handed to you on a plate - you need to be proactive in making that happen. The main issue is compensation. Compared to other firms, Kantar is very weak in terms of being able to offer competitive salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Work-life balance can be a drag at times (on busy weeks I'll work ~50 hours), but generally, it's not so bad as long as you're mentally prepared for it.Sometimes too much red tape.

Long hours, low pay, poor leadership, high CEO turnover Slow-turning wheels with a very defined hierarchy so upward movement is tough. I personally have had a very strong career at Kantar changing roles and moving countries with opportunities to work in the UK, then China and now in the USA. I've been promoted a number of times and feel that my work is very valued. However I'd say that the formal career management isn't great - in my experience you have to ask for the roles you want and, if you're good at what you do, the company makes it happen. In fact I was able to create my current role from scratch as it previously didn't exist. So take control of your own career at Kantar and don't expect the next great role to be handed to you on a plate - you need to be proactive in making that happen.Sometimes too much red tape.

Dealing with POS customers on a daily basis Family (ownership) all have their own agendas, no consistent leadership message. Certain individuals in the organization are unprofessional and speak to employees disrespectfully. If you enjoy old school practices, including being treated like as a true subordinate, you'll like it here. No accountability for excessive absenteeism, puts a burden on coworkers. Extremely high turnover. Pay rate isn't what they initially claim. They emphasize max theoretical hourly pay. But in reality focusing on $19 base pay is much more realistic. Or just state the MEDIAN pay (or alternatively Mean/ avg pay) of that department from previous peak season. Or across that dept for the previous 12 month window. Early 5am start for 1st shift break stock. Still only 2 days off & 8hr days when OT not mandated. Algorithm that determines daily %, needs tweaked. Too easy to game the system. Workers are kind, but many are set in their ways. Many, but not all, can become quite territorial over products, work zones, & particular roles for that day within the break stock department. High turnover rate. They don't value each worker as much as they claim. Treated as just a human resource, Incentive pay (above $19 base pay) doesn't work very well. The up to 170% idea creates morale, greed, & territorial issues. Could simply raise base pay a few $, & lower or eliminate the 170% part. Unhelpful & unnecessary mechanism. In theory exists to keep ppl stocking at max speed. Simply doesn't work out that way. Not meaning to bash all incentive programs. This one is just VERY flawed for break stock dept. Maybe other depts as well, idk for sure. Definitely not a very team oriented setup in any way. None at all none at all Seemed to be organized chaos building is much bigger than I thought! I got taken advantage of when my coworker accused me of assault, despite her history of stirring up trouble with other employees.

A man is still there after a note was left anonymously on a leads desk stating he touches females!! A trainer is there after cussing her trainee out, with witnesses! Hourly pay is subpar compared to other manufacturing companies Management is the only con. All of the team leads are great, but when you get up to the Plant Manager and even Human Resources, they are completely unprofessional is more ways than I can even begin to say here. Upper Management lies & deviates from questions on policy & they don’t know anything about how the manufacturing employees are being driven like mules & completely burned out.

Emphasis on Proper onboarding is lacking- Evident in older leaders vs newer leaders Company is focused on quantity over quality. Field employees and Brides frown upon rushed service and alterations for such a special event Started as a seasonal stylist and worked my BUTT off. I performed even in the down season and finally was promoted to sales manager. It started great at first then all the sudden, not only were there new contracts out the wazoo, but I was responsible for a minimum statistic for every single one of them. They rarely worked out the bugs of new things before starting to hold managers accountable. Made it virtually impossible to bonus. Wouldn’t raise the wage yet get mad when we didn’t hire quality employees. They take the word of ANONYMOUS HR letters, geared toward complaining employees who don’t like to work. They allowed me to do my bridal show KNOWING they were going to fire me. No recognition for the 7 years of service. I missed out on SO many family functions because of their stupid “Bridal Christmas” and it’s demanding schedule. They preach “mental health” bull but then fired me for being late after I crashed my car. SMALL and I mean SMALL policy violations ended my career. -$300 in my account. So thanks. And alllll thanks to a slimy snake who (Still) works there who instead of earning a promotion wrote letters to get people fired. Literally screw this company. You were expected to simultaneously do three people’s jobs at once. There was no limit to how many appointments could be made and you had to accommodate way too many people at once. The customers could be absolutely volatile at times and it was incredibly mentally taxing especially in management, I felt like I could never leave work at times even on my days off. If we were well staffed I would say I was paid okay, but since I had to be a manager, stylist, and csr all at once, I feel like I wasn’t compensated properly. You also had to work holidays like Fourth of July and Memorial Day which sort of sucked at times too. Training was also very poor, if I didn’t know how to do something I was asked to reach out to another store. Corporate and new owners don’t care. They take away our positions and give us new titles with less pay and take away bonuses for the same amount of work. If somebody complains, they refund them. Policy doesn’t mean anything because they go against it anyway. Pay is bad, demands are impossible to reach, staffing is terrible. New owners are worse than the last ones. Lack of raise amounts Trust in ELT based on a devious decisions that led to a bankruptcy and potential closure.(luckily it did not) Expectation versus reality of paperwork in a sales driven industry needs to be readjusted. Paperwork in retain should not be a main priority. It should be customer service and sales Work and home life balance - weekends are mandatory. Management made it nearly impossible to get commissions The base pay is not great Some customers were hostile towards the stylists Cleaning staff only comes once a week Management is catty, but that's what you get in retail- difficult for employees to voice concerns without being dismissed, and the threat of retaliation for bringing something to store manager's attention is high. Very few hours to offer, inconsistent training across the team means dresses are frequently pinned wrong, and the world seems to think we're closed. (We're not. Please show up to your appointment.) Overall, a good place to gain experience but the operations side of things are sometimes difficult to handle as an employee. -a high-stress work environment that you aren't compensated for -typically asked to go above job description because they need the help -incredibly high turnover -poor stress management which feeds othersCustomers could lack basic compassion or understanding at times, but good management meant this wasn’t much of an issue.

Training was also very poor, if I didn’t know how to do something I was asked to reach out to another store. -No opportunities for Full time -Low pay -They force you to work “on-call”. Scheduling & cutting hours daily. Your told to check your schedule multiple times a day. You show up for your shift and find out your hours are cut when not enough brides have shown up. Corporate and new owners don’t care. They take away our positions and give us new titles with less pay and take away bonuses for the same amount of work. If somebody complains, they refund them. Policy doesn’t mean anything because they go against it anyway. Pay is bad, demands are impossible to reach, staffing is terrible. New owners are worse than the last ones. Lack of raise amounts Trust in ELT based on a devious decisions that led to a bankruptcy and potential closure.(luckily it did not) Expectation versus reality of paperwork in a sales driven industry needs to be readjusted. Paperwork in retain should not be a main priority. It should be customer service and sales Work and home life balance - weekends are mandatory. Management made it nearly impossible to get commissions The base pay is not great Some customers were hostile towards the stylists Management is catty, but that's what you get in retail- difficult for employees to voice concerns without being dismissed, and the threat of retaliation for bringing something to store manager's attention is high. Very few hours to offer, inconsistent training across the team means dresses are frequently pinned wrong, and the world seems to think we're closed. (We're not. Please show up to your appointment.) Overall, a good place to gain experience but the operations side of things are sometimes difficult to handle as an employee. Cleaning staff only comes once a weekCustomers could lack basic compassion or understanding at times, but good management meant this wasn’t much of an issue. Emphasis on Proper onboarding is lacking- Evident in older leaders vs newer leaders Company is focused on quantity over quality. Field employees and Brides frown upon rushed service and alterations for such a special event Started as a seasonal stylist and worked my BUTT off. I performed even in the down season and finally was promoted to sales manager. It started great at first then all the sudden, not only were there new contracts out the wazoo, but I was responsible for a minimum statistic for every single one of them. They rarely worked out the bugs of new things before starting to hold managers accountable. Made it virtually impossible to bonus. Wouldn’t raise the wage yet get mad when we didn’t hire quality employees. They take the word of ANONYMOUS HR letters, geared toward complaining employees who don’t like to work. They allowed me to do my bridal show KNOWING they were going to fire me. No recognition for the 7 years of service. I missed out on SO many family functions because of their stupid “Bridal Christmas” and it’s demanding schedule. They preach “mental health” bull but then fired me for being late after I crashed my car. SMALL and I mean SMALL policy violations ended my career. -$300 in my account. So thanks. And alllll thanks to a slimy snake who (Still) works there who instead of earning a promotion wrote letters to get people fired. Literally screw this company. You were expected to simultaneously do three people’s jobs at once. There was no limit to how many appointments could be made and you had to accommodate way too many people at once. The customers could be absolutely volatile at times and it was incredibly mentally taxing especially in management, I felt like I could never leave work at times even on my days off.

First job ever that never gave me a problem. I spent more time working than I did with my family.

Paid training, work at home, EAP, tuition reimbursement program","Need a longer lunch break The entire company is a joke. If you are a work at home staff member they bow down to your needs or wants. If you are an on site staff member you are literal less than garbage. They expect on site to handle all jobs for offsite staff even if the job is outside of the onsite staffs job description or knowledge or access and even if offsite staff can come in and do it themselves. They do not take the needs of their onsite staff into consideration in regards to anything. Leadership verbally says out loud “we are not one team” when the company always tries to use that joke of a statement. They are also shutting down the Phoenix location and moving all staff to Tempe but are hiding it from onsite staff. Staff will have limited parking, is losing gym access, is losing desk access ect. On site staff have been told word for word “their opinions do not matter so do not bother giving them.” Onsite is constantly short staff so sometimes it’s hard to stay in service levels and are threatened by senior leadership to “get over it and do it or else”. EVERYTHING! The pay is barely anything for the AMOUNT of work you have to do. & I’m always confused at the people who have been with the company for years they are robots on the phones. 1. They want you to give their customer white glove service but they paying brown glove wages 2. Call are back to back half the time 3. They want you to do soooooo much on one call that if you don’t then they hounding you. 4. If you need help they’re not gonna help you in the chat 5. Horrible systems 6.half the numbers don’t work to get to other departments 7. The customers are RUDE AF 8.most times you’re really winging it 9. They wanted us to process claims while on the phone & then fuss about hold time 10. They lie about bid shifts & ohhh you gotta bid shift every 3 months 11. Then they promote people who they want 12. It’s a numbers game to them 13. Work life balance is shi* 14. You also gotta bid for vacation at the beginning of the year & that is also based off you metrics 15. They dont give raises & if they do it’s .25 at a time 15. Making $$$$ from the clients but don’t want to pay 16. Also did I say the pay was horrible aF (just noticed I did 15 twice) 18. The manger over the phones side r**** is a bs’er 19. Doesn’t care about their employees 20. Only give a 30min lunch (who can eat in 30minutes) 21. Always having issues 22. & the pay was S*IT some toxic callers, staffing is always weird either too many people or not enough people making call volume fluctuate, VTO is offered but not to closers due to their lack of scheduling Extra work that you will not be paid for, unpaid overtime, doesn't allow ample training for new systems, no opportunities for advancement, sneaky business practices, will trick you into doing extra work for a raise they won't ever give you. Management admitted they only hire overseas now because they can pay them less than onshore reps. They laid off our entire team and so many others without any solid transition plan. Lots of work and effort to support vulnerable members will without a doubt be lost. They were kind enough to give us 2 weeks notice and severance. Senior leadership truly operates as if you are just a position. I knew UHC’s reputation for layoffs going in, I regret ignoring that knowledge. I always thought it’d never happen to me. Rest assured, if you work for UHC long enough, you will be laid off. Some had been there 20+ years, and others less than 9 months. Just across the board elimination of teams and departments. i do not have anything bad to say or negative -Can be stuffy corporate environment -Slow to make change My book of business has changed three times in one year.

On site staff have been told word for word “their opinions do not matter so do not bother giving them.” Onsite is constantly short staff so sometimes it’s hard to stay in service levels and are threatened by senior leadership to “get over it and do it or else”. EVERYTHING! The pay is barely anything for the AMOUNT of work you have to do. & I’m always confused at the people who have been with the company for years they are robots on the phones. 1. They want you to give their customer white glove service but they paying brown glove wages 2. Call are back to back half the time 3. They want you to do soooooo much on one call that if you don’t then they hounding you. 4. If you need help they’re not gonna help you in the chat 5. Horrible systems 6.half the numbers don’t work to get to other departments 7. The customers are RUDE AF 8.most times you’re really winging it 9. They wanted us to process claims while on the phone & then fuss about hold time 10. They lie about bid shifts & ohhh you gotta bid shift every 3 months 11. Then they promote people who they want 12. It’s a numbers game to them 13. Work life balance is shi* 14. You also gotta bid for vacation at the beginning of the year & that is also based off you metrics 15. They dont give raises & if they do it’s .25 at a time 15. Making $$$$ from the clients but don’t want to pay 16. Also did I say the pay was horrible aF (just noticed I did 15 twice) 18. The manger over the phones side r**** is a bs’er 19. Doesn’t care about their employees 20. Only give a 30min lunch (who can eat in 30minutes) 21. Always having issues 22. & the pay was S*IT some toxic callers, staffing is always weird either too many people or not enough people making call volume fluctuate, VTO is offered but not to closers due to their lack of scheduling Extra work that you will not be paid for, unpaid overtime, doesn't allow ample training for new systems, no opportunities for advancement, sneaky business practices, will trick you into doing extra work for a raise they won't ever give you. Management admitted they only hire overseas now because they can pay them less than onshore reps. They laid off our entire team and so many others without any solid transition plan. Lots of work and effort to support vulnerable members will without a doubt be lost. They were kind enough to give us 2 weeks notice and severance. Senior leadership truly operates as if you are just a position. I knew UHC’s reputation for layoffs going in, I regret ignoring that knowledge. I always thought it’d never happen to me. Rest assured, if you work for UHC long enough, you will be laid off. Some had been there 20+ years, and others less than 9 months. Just across the board elimination of teams and departments. i do not have anything bad to say or negative -Can be stuffy corporate environment -Slow to make change My book of business has changed three times in one year. No current comments about conssome toxic callers, staffing is always weird either too many people or not enough people making call volume fluctuate, VTO is offered but not to closers due to their lack of scheduling The entire company is a joke. If you are a work at home staff member they bow down to your needs or wants. If you are an on site staff member you are literal less than garbage. They expect on site to handle all jobs for offsite staff even if the job is outside of the onsite staffs job description or knowledge or access and even if offsite staff can come in and do it themselves.

No current comments about cons it was a member services position so we dealt with mostly UHC/Medicare Members and boy was that tough .. getting cussed out daily .. lots od micromanaging but when questions asked or support needed for call there is nobody to be found everyone is ghost !! Stress, burnout, some of the management difficult to move within company without jumping through hoops you have to continue working for 2 years after each education reimbursement They over work you and under pay you. New hires get way money then established employees.Need a longer lunch break The entire company is a joke. If you are a work at home staff member they bow down to your needs or wants.

Micromanagement to the highest degree, extremely metric based, low pay for the amount of work that is expected, training was confusing and not effective, ""patient advocate"" title covers what it actually is...an inbound call center job. - You will start off at 18.25/hr (depending on location but it will be the bottom of the rung pay) - The expectation will initially be that you will be helping the 65+ community with their benefits and answer questions about said benefits. -The people that you're helping are confused and upset because UnitedHealth is a for profit company, they don't care if people are dying or not. They care about their bottom line. In turn those people take out their frustrations on whoever answers the phone. - They will slowly start to tack on more responsibilities after you are out of training under the guise of ""helping another department"" and will give you a day of training and expect you to start taking those calls until the ""other department doesn't need help anymore"". Which just means you'll be doing it permanently. -Currently I am taking calls and ""helping"" with the web tech dept, rewards dept, transportation dept, and the employer group retirees. Those calls are alongside the Medicare and Retirement calls I take. Not to mention when they onboarded a massive new retiree client and expected us to take calls even though none of the information that we were receiving was correct and made the member infuriated. - You will be expected to keep your metrics in range even if you have no idea what you're doing. -A good portion of your metric score is based on the member survey, so it doesn't matter how hard you try because of someone is upset at UnitedHealth then you're going to get a crappy survey. -After all that, I still make $18.25/hr which in this economy isn't even a living wage. - My mental health has taken a massive hit because of the amount of stress that this job entails. I attempted to take my (paid for) Short Term Disability for mental health reasons and was denied. -I've just quit trying.

It’s a numbers game to them 13. Work life balance is shi* 14. You also gotta bid for vacation at the beginning of the year & that is also based off you metrics 15. They dont give raises & if they do it’s .25 at a time 15. Making $$$$ from the clients but don’t want to pay 16. Also did I say the pay was horrible aF (just noticed I did 15 twice) 18. The manger over the phones side r**** is a bs’er 19. Doesn’t care about their employees 20. Only give a 30min lunch (who can eat in 30minutes) 21. Always having issues 22. & the pay was S*IT -Can be stuffy corporate environment -Slow to make change My book of business has changed three times in one year. No current comments about cons it was a member services position so we dealt with mostly UHC/Medicare Members and boy was that tough .. getting cussed out daily .. lots od micromanaging but when questions asked or support needed for call there is nobody to be found everyone is ghost !! Stress, burnout, some of the management difficult to move within company without jumping through hoops you have to continue working for 2 years after each education reimbursement They over work you and under pay you. New hires get way money then established employees.Need a longer lunch break some toxic callers, staffing is always weird either too many people or not enough people making call volume fluctuate, VTO is offered but not to closers due to their lack of scheduling The entire company is a joke. If you are a work at home staff member they bow down to your needs or wants. If you are an on site staff member you are literal less than garbage. They expect on site to handle all jobs for offsite staff even if the job is outside of the onsite staffs job description or knowledge or access and even if offsite staff can come in and do it themselves. They do not take the needs of their onsite staff into consideration in regards to anything. Leadership verbally says out loud “we are not one team” when the company always tries to use that joke of a statement. They are also shutting down the Phoenix location and moving all staff to Tempe but are hiding it from onsite staff. Staff will have limited parking, is losing gym access, is losing desk access ect. On site staff have been told word for word “their opinions do not matter so do not bother giving them.” Onsite is constantly short staff so sometimes it’s hard to stay in service levels and are threatened by senior leadership to “get over it and do it or else”. EVERYTHING! The pay is barely anything for the AMOUNT of work you have to do. & I’m always confused at the people who have been with the company for years they are robots on the phones. 1. They want you to give their customer white glove service but they paying brown glove wages 2. Call are back to back half the time 3. They want you to do soooooo much on one call that if you don’t then they hounding you. 4. If you need help they’re not gonna help you in the chat 5. Horrible systems 6.half the numbers don’t work to get to other departments 7. The customers are RUDE AF 8.most times you’re really winging it 9.

Extra work that you will not be paid for, unpaid overtime, doesn't allow ample training for new systems, no opportunities for advancement, sneaky business practices, will trick you into doing extra work for a raise they won't ever give you. Management admitted they only hire overseas now because they can pay them less than onshore reps."

Female CEO and multiple women in senior leadership. Pretty laid back, lots of down time","Challenging some days to keep up with all the changes It was Hard during the holidays hour cuts often, nearly impossible to grow within the company, the policies made by corporate don't take smaller stores in to account, planograms aren't made to fit actual stores, high turnover because of terrible hours that they try to blame on store managers. After 5 (five) years of consistent good work, above and beyond, I had to fight for my last pay raise just for them to increase people who had just got trained in my position, working with the company less than 6 months, the same hourly wage. When it came time to give me a true leadership role as assistant manager, the role disappeared They have several over worked store managers, that needed assistant managers, recently quit because of lack of support. Beauty advisors voices do not matter to upper management, and the ist goes on. Disorganized and unprofessional management. Was told my store was closing, made other plans, then they changed their minds and I had to cancel my trip home - then they closed the store anyway 7 months later! If you *don't* have a manager and coworkers in store who are competent and helpful, then a lot of the duties of running the store will fall to you, if you don't advocate for yourself you might end up not being fairly compensated. It's also a bit annoying the way they make you push credit cards and they're always on you about being on the customers convincing them to buy more things. I've experienced unreliable variance in hours scheduled without much communication about it. The corporate radio is repetitive to a maddening degree if you work enough hours, also upper management pushes ""team"" and ""owning our business"" narratives despite the fact that you, the working class laborer, definitely actually don't 'own' the business as a CEO does at all, you just sell your time and labor in exchange for minimum wage. (Which... tbh it's just kind of insulting to me that they pretend otherwise, but I suppose that's how the game goes anywhere?) also when my state's minimum wage went up at the start of this year, Sally's took away time and a half on Sundays (once they were no longer legally required to pay it) which is... clearly a trade off to result in less of an actual pay raise for employees. Shame, because it was one of my favorite job perks. Management is toxic, deluded and does not care about their employees. There is absolutely no stability here, and expectations are not clear. They will regularly add on extra responsibilities to your job with no additional compensation, and force you to absorb the responsibilities of open roles (if people quit or get fired, their positions take 6+ months to re fill, or often times not at all). People are fired left and right for no reason other than personal opinions, and speaking up to HR or your manager will get you reprimanded. There is extreme mistrust, and teams that were once efficient are now broken up, missing headcount, and lowered moral under incompetent management. There are no down sides!! There’s flexible scheduling and good pay!! Culture is lacking accountability, and leadership and executive amnesia is rampant. Limited mobility as there are large gaps between levels. High turnover causes lots of stop starts, and firedrills. Lack overall organization and saying change is desired, but leadership doesn't lean in to enable it. Headcount is light, so people are working a lot of hours outside the norm just to stay afloat.

Beauty advisors voices do not matter to upper management, and the ist goes on. Disorganized and unprofessional management. Was told my store was closing, made other plans, then they changed their minds and I had to cancel my trip home - then they closed the store anyway 7 months later! Management is toxic, deluded and does not care about their employees. There is absolutely no stability here, and expectations are not clear. They will regularly add on extra responsibilities to your job with no additional compensation, and force you to absorb the responsibilities of open roles (if people quit or get fired, their positions take 6+ months to re fill, or often times not at all). People are fired left and right for no reason other than personal opinions, and speaking up to HR or your manager will get you reprimanded. There is extreme mistrust, and teams that were once efficient are now broken up, missing headcount, and lowered moral under incompetent management. Culture is lacking accountability, and leadership and executive amnesia is rampant. Limited mobility as there are large gaps between levels. High turnover causes lots of stop starts, and firedrills. Lack overall organization and saying change is desired, but leadership doesn't lean in to enable it. Headcount is light, so people are working a lot of hours outside the norm just to stay afloat. Managers are unprofessional, robotic and expect too much for the little pay given. I got a higher position so I asked for a raised they told me I didn’t deserve one and to stop asking. Even made me sign a paper stating I wouldn’t talk about my wages or ask for a raise ever again. -this company loves meetings. most employees spend the bulk of their day in meetings resulting in small chunks of time to get actual work done. -the churn at Sally is the highest I have ever seen. I believe this is primarily due to people being overworked, underpaid, and few opportunities for advancement. -difficult to get clear direction from the top resulting in each team having to make decisions on their own that often conflict with one another and are only caught after the fact. This cycle continues quarter over quarter. -extremely low morale. Lots of layoffs and overworked people. Long hours, short staffed, labor hoursChallenging some days to keep up with all the changes It was Hard during the holidays hour cuts often, nearly impossible to grow within the company, the policies made by corporate don't take smaller stores in to account, planograms aren't made to fit actual stores, high turnover because of terrible hours that they try to blame on store managers.

If you *don't* have a manager and coworkers in store who are competent and helpful, then a lot of the duties of running the store will fall to you, if you don't advocate for yourself you might end up not being fairly compensated. It's also a bit annoying the way they make you push credit cards and they're always on you about being on the customers convincing them to buy more things. I've experienced unreliable variance in hours scheduled without much communication about it. The corporate radio is repetitive to a maddening degree if you work enough hours, also upper management pushes ""team"" and ""owning our business"" narratives despite the fact that you, the working class laborer, definitely actually don't 'own' the business as a CEO does at all, you just sell your time and labor in exchange for minimum wage. (Which... tbh it's just kind of insulting to me that they pretend otherwise, but I suppose that's how the game goes anywhere?) also when my state's minimum wage went up at the start of this year, Sally's took away time and a half on Sundays (once they were no longer legally required to pay it) which is... clearly a trade off to result in less of an actual pay raise for employees.

Everything is perfect nothing as such Pay, some leadership isn't great They always change the commission tier payout for my location if we all perform well changing the tiers to an amount so high no one can reach past tier 1 without taking on 1,500 customers a month in a location that’s very small compared to Boston or LGA Poor pay with minimal bonus structure only once a year. Minimum 10 hours required per day on salaried pay Overtime is limited to having lots of cars to clean when many people will be leaving, system is sometimes down and workers must punch out in paper and take photos to prove their hours. Lumbering Giant of a company. COVID has changed the game. Management is burned out and disrespectful of their reports.

Any kind of promotion or job change requires you apply thru USA jobs - essentially a computer based system that selects qualified candidates based on multiple choice answers. Many applicants who exaggerate their knowledge thru these answers are ‘referred’ for promotion consideration. The IRS has become a very unrewarding place to work - I don’t recommend it. Hard work and knowledge are not valued. They only want to promote people who play the game. IRS is in trouble going forward - everyone who actually knows what they are doing are retiring/leaving - the people left are inexperienced newbies who have been promoted only because they want to be managers. IRS is literally becoming a bunch of inexperienced managers managing nobody. No overtime everrrr Get used to dealing with upset customers on every call Management doesn't like to help when you request. So please learn how to find things on your own Keep in mind my experience is not the same as other employees. During the pandemic the stress was high. Management couldn't keep people, and at the time there was a hiring freeze. People began to crack mentally. if you want to end up feeling like a robot, this is the perfect place for you. Breaks are heavily monitored. You are rewarded with ridiculous things like a new highlighter or a fun size candy bar, with a childish note. Frequent mandatory overtime. New manager regularly. Always being tied to the phones is stressful and the burnout is real. Training is horrible and you barely learn anything that's actually related to the job. The thousands of IRM's are always changing so you can never really be consistent doing this job. The pay is very low starting off and does not equate to the skills and experience needed to do this job. Every minute of the day is accounted for through the softphone so you feel like a prisoner in your own house. Out of nowhere, you might be forced to do a training on staffing another gate such as Identity Theft or TPP (Taxpayer Protection Program), and the training only last for maybe a day which is not enough. Once you are certified, your calls start getting monitored by a CER and you never know which call they choose. It's also very easy to get errors on calls, especially if you have a CER who is petty. Micro-management is a big thing here. Onboarding was a huge mess and not organized at all. High turnover rate; most people quit in training, or find other federal jobs while in training. I prefer the latter. Systems are the worst, ive never experienced something so horrible as their systems and resolutions (IRM'S) hours weren't the best for me Paper pushing, red tape, not paid for judgement, ""field"" collection is a dead end unless you want to go to appeals or management, health insurance costs increase drastically each year, case load. Tons of paperwork and administration work take time away from the actual job. A bit too much pressure on finishing tasks when IRS is short staffed and/or equipment is old. Lots of old equipment. Many jobs are one person jobs: it is 'yours' and no other person does your job when you are out sick/on vacation so work piles up. IRS tries to save money by finding and securing new vendors, software, etc. The time it takes to learn the new steps is too much as it happens too often. There was one piece of software I never learned - I had no time -- and it was recently replaced. Great, avoided wasting time that eats into my regular 'real' work with that one. New persons will miss out on interactions with older staff due to ""work from home"". I learned most of the job from interacting with coworkers and/or listening. It takes about 5 years to really learn the job, the software, the law, the rules, etcProtocol changes almost daily here.

Education doesnt mean anything to them, it is all about who you know, not what you know or what you can bring to the table. The managers have no clue what they are doing, most are young kids fresh out of college with no experience. Sites are always down or broken. They laid off a ton of people last year, and secretly hired 20+ back on as ""contingent workers"" to avoid legal issues. They also posted the same positions they laid off for within two weeks prior to the lay offs. They like to pretend there are a bunch of opportunities, but it is like jumping through the ring of fire to move up. I have only gotten a 40 cent raise in 3 years! Not even a dollar. Would not recommend this company or their tactics at all. I haven't been here long enough for this to be my opinion, but pay increases are apparently hard to come by. Not much support on how to move up, but they are working on this. Structure as far as policies and procedures have had a lot of grey areas. My main complaint is pay since I took a decrease coming here. Can be given deliveries that are most definitely not worth your time doing, but if you decline too many your acceptance rate drops. If you fall below 70% you'll get less high paying orders, and dropping below 50% is really bad. You only get one chance to reset the acceptance rate, so can't keep letting it fall, so sometimes you gotta accept those super low paying orders (could very well be no tip and only Doordash pay of around $2.00). Hard to force yourself out there when you don't get punished for not doing it and don't consider it a real job. Doing pay-by-hour mostly is not worth it at all. Not enough money to really live if you're an adult because it's pretty much just relying on tips. Would prefer a job with an actually set, and worthy, payment.

Non tippers lower your acceptance rating if you decline them and if you do them, you are basically paying out of your own pocket to deliver their order. And the non tippers are usually the first to complain about anything you do wrong. I had one complain about me because there was a wreck on the highway and I had to make my way down side streets and through traffic to get around it.

I wish there were better instructions in the beginning so I knew what I was doing. Non tippers lower your acceptance rating if you decline them and if you do them, you are basically paying out of your own pocket to deliver their order. And the non tippers are usually the first to complain about anything you do wrong. I had one complain about me because there was a wreck on the highway and I had to make my way down side streets and through traffic to get around it. Nothing I could do about it, but they complained even though I was within the time limit given. Still irks me but whatever. Only time I've ever gotten a bad review.- Not many traditional tech perks -Wear and tear on vehicle. -Gas can be pretty expensive. Pay is brutal. Education doesnt mean anything to them, it is all about who you know, not what you know or what you can bring to the table. The managers have no clue what they are doing, most are young kids fresh out of college with no experience. Sites are always down or broken. They laid off a ton of people last year, and secretly hired 20+ back on as ""contingent workers"" to avoid legal issues.

My main complaint is pay since I took a decrease coming here. Can be given deliveries that are most definitely not worth your time doing, but if you decline too many your acceptance rate drops. If you fall below 70% you'll get less high paying orders, and dropping below 50% is really bad. You only get one chance to reset the acceptance rate, so can't keep letting it fall, so sometimes you gotta accept those super low paying orders (could very well be no tip and only Doordash pay of around $2.00). Hard to force yourself out there when you don't get punished for not doing it and don't consider it a real job. Doing pay-by-hour mostly is not worth it at all. Not enough money to really live if you're an adult because it's pretty much just relying on tips. Would prefer a job with an actually set, and worthy, payment.

Company recently RIF'd 24 staff from FAA FFRDC, due to dropping gov't funding...yet company has significant number of VPs all sucking off of overhead. No attempt to manage money within the ""leadership"" ranks. Last year company went through a major business transformation...that failed...yet, VPs held staff accountable for reporting on a subpar system that lasted over 12 months. Could not even get business data to report to gov't for over 2 months, yet, person who was in charge of the business transformation is still at MITRE. If this happened to any other MITRE employee, they would've been gone. Oddly enough the person in charge of the business transformation is the CEOs brother. Amazing how that happens. He'll probably get a bonus because of his substandard performance. MITRE recently invested in opening up an office in Australia. All on company overhead. significant large numbers of VPs travelling out to ""visit""...yet company has the audacity to reduce benefits as part of cost cutting measures. Company has now taken on a ""for profit"" mentality. It's all about delivery... so VPS and GMs can spend, spend, spend. Board of Directors should take a good look at what is happening and make some swift changes from the CEO on down. BOD should also implement an independent IG like entity to investigate what is seeming like waste, fraud and abuse by CEO, GMs and VPs. Time for the Fat Cats to get purged!!! New benefit changes have adversely affected those with long tenure, C suite has made decisions without fair warning to the rest of the company, there is a lack of trust and communication between the decision makers and other employees. You can always find better pay and benefits by switching companies, but I have found the work life balance and flexibility to be very good at MITRE which I would not trade in for higher pay, plus knowing it’s a not-for-profit and I’m doing influential work is worth it to me. I worry a lot about the direction senior management is taking the company. The company hired a lot during the pandemic and liberally spent money on all sorts of things (including more VP positions)…but has been losing work in a number of large portfolios and seems to be struggling to find staff work. There are also a lot of projects MITRE gets in on that an FFRDC shouldn’t rightly be taking on. As many people also mention, senior leadership seems out of touch. As a fairly flat organization that encourages questioning and speaks truth to power, I really don’t understand why the CEO needs to explicitly exempt himself from wearing his badge around MITRE facilities. One of many condescending and belittling behaviors exhibited. Changes to PTO and benefits really have affected morale and engagement and it will take a couple of years for this to shake off completely. Long-term it may be okay but the recent changes concern me about trajectory and whether it will get worse. You can just get kicked off a project with no warning and no real reason except ""it wasn't in the budget anymore"" or ""we didn't get as much money from the sponsor as we wanted,"" and because MITRE is not-for-profit, there's no overhead charge code for that missing project time. You either need to scramble to find a new project or use your PTO to fill that allocation. There's also no guarantees to have project work once you get a job here. You have to continue to network and find work basically the whole time. Handling of the recent reduction in bankable vacation hours was horrible. Barely a month of notice to use it or lose it and their face-saver statement was “you aren’t losing it, you just stop accruing it”. Talk about Ministry of Truth. When a smaller reduction in bankable hours was made many years ago, we had 16 months to get below the new cap. Now we have to choose between losing vacation or failing to meet sponsor expectations/deadlines if we use weeks of vacation with zero notice. Modernization of financial tools was rushed and poorly planned by management. The financial worker bees busted their butts but were shoveling against the tide. The contractors were scared at how fast they were pushed to get their software working for MITRE. And the recent RIF of FAA supporting employees was done with one day notice by auto-gen email when those same skills are needed on the defense side which is hiring! No opportunity for them to find a new position on the defense side. Leadership at the top is making decisions that have made me lose confidence in their ability to lead. For reasons never fully shared with rank-and-file, leadership has turned the company 90 degrees toward ""sales outreach"" and ""non-govt business,"" burning hundreds of millions and chipping away at the prior fed-consulting cash cow by so doing. Said initiative's poor execution has resulted in end-of-year funding shortfalls, an abortive five-day November furlough, reduced holidays/vacation time, and a handful of quiet under-the-radar micro layoffs, all presented under the guise of ""We're in good shape, we're a very successful company, check us out on Google and Glassdoor, you'll see how competitive we are."" Hundreds of staff are currently scrabbling to find billable work, due to a mixture of paperwork logjams and billable-cost overruns. Another staff reduction is clearly imminent, despite management's demurrals and evasions. Under previous leadership this company used to be an amazing organization because they used to care about their employees. We used to win awards for being one of the best companies to work for. The retention rate is extremely high and MITRE does not care to keep you. They have lost so many incredible, talented people and under this new leadership, there attitude is don't let the door hit you on your way out. MITRE was never this way. They used to care. The current leadership cares nothing about employees who have tenure. Here's the huge disconnect -Before I begin, I worked at MITRE for over a decade, therefore I have no issues with changes. Change is Good if it benefits everyone! After all MITRE is MITRE because of the employees! Here's where the disconnect, MITRE has hired several external employees who do NOT know nor understand how this organization works. MITRE used to treat ALL employees with RESPECT. Although a large organization it used to once feel like a family/team working together to deliver outstanding quality work to our sponsors. Those days are long gone. As for me, it was time for me to go. When you undervalued, disrespected, unappreciated, it's time for you to choose you! The CEO is tone deaf, condescending, and completely out of touch with his employees. The latest examples of this are: A CEO podcast in which he expressed surprise that employees were worried about cuts, stating that he was not aware of any cuts. This was less than a month after PTO cuts and a reduction in force of about 25 people. A new security policy where he, and he alone, is allowed to walk around the building without a badge, and security has been instructed not to challenge him. Literally everyone else must wear a badge. A later CEO podcast in which he and his interviewer commiserated that poor reviews on this website can bring morale down, without addressing the concerns brought up in those reviews, which mostly revolve around him and the rest of the C-suite. Employees were told that a recent all-hands meeting would be followed by a CEO call in which we could ask questions about what we'd heard. That CEO call was canceled and has not been rescheduled. I am hoping that is because our board of directors is finally pulling their heads out of the sand and taking action to address his issues, but my hopes are not terribly high, as they have appeared disinclined to take any action to date. - continual need to job hunt ( every ~6 months or so) to maintain contract coverage, can be extremely nerve-wracking as you're also expected to network and find jobs for those that work under you - year after year we've seen reduction in benefits, given that salary is lower than comparable private sector companies that makes the company less attractive - company is spread far apart (you'll often be on teams with people located in several different teams), but leadership is gradually enforcing more RTO measuresdependency on federal funding can cause stress during Congressional budget and debt ceiling debates Too many VP,s that are not held accountable.

No opportunity for them to find a new position on the defense side. Leadership at the top is making decisions that have made me lose confidence in their ability to lead. Current leadership is seriously out of touch or is intentionally trying to drive away people with more than 5 years invested in the company. Communication is terrible. The CEO provides conflicting information from what is distributed. They waffle on decisions, execute poorly in a way to undermine confidence. Currently messaging says the company ""had the best year ever"" yet seems to be scrambling to try and reduce costs. The company doesn't seem to have an issue getting revenue, but they definitely have an issue over spending, particularly on internal investments focused under the labs construct. They seem to double down on failures vs. accepting that it was perhaps a bad idea and adjusting course.

A new security policy where he, and he alone, is allowed to walk around the building without a badge, and security has been instructed not to challenge him. Literally everyone else must wear a badge. A later CEO podcast in which he and his interviewer commiserated that poor reviews on this website can bring morale down, without addressing the concerns brought up in those reviews, which mostly revolve around him and the rest of the C-suite. Employees were told that a recent all-hands meeting would be followed by a CEO call in which we could ask questions about what we'd heard. That CEO call was canceled and has not been rescheduled. I am hoping that is because our board of directors is finally pulling their heads out of the sand and taking action to address his issues, but my hopes are not terribly high, as they have appeared disinclined to take any action to date. - continual need to job hunt ( every ~6 months or so) to maintain contract coverage, can be extremely nerve-wracking as you're also expected to network and find jobs for those that work under you - year after year we've seen reduction in benefits, given that salary is lower than comparable private sector companies that makes the company less attractive - company is spread far apart (you'll often be on teams with people located in several different teams), but leadership is gradually enforcing more RTO measuresdependency on federal funding can cause stress during Congressional budget and debt ceiling debates Too many VP,s that are not held accountable. Company recently RIF'd 24 staff from FAA FFRDC, due to dropping gov't funding...yet company has significant number of VPs all sucking off of overhead. No attempt to manage money within the ""leadership"" ranks. Last year company went through a major business transformation...that failed...yet, VPs held staff accountable for reporting on a subpar system that lasted over 12 months. Could not even get business data to report to gov't for over 2 months, yet, person who was in charge of the business transformation is still at MITRE. If this happened to any other MITRE employee, they would've been gone. Oddly enough the person in charge of the business transformation is the CEOs brother. Amazing how that happens. He'll probably get a bonus because of his substandard performance. MITRE recently invested in opening up an office in Australia. All on company overhead. significant large numbers of VPs travelling out to ""visit""...yet company has the audacity to reduce benefits as part of cost cutting measures. Company has now taken on a ""for profit"" mentality. It's all about delivery... so VPS and GMs can spend, spend, spend. Board of Directors should take a good look at what is happening and make some swift changes from the CEO on down. BOD should also implement an independent IG like entity to investigate what is seeming like waste, fraud and abuse by CEO, GMs and VPs. Time for the Fat Cats to get purged!!! New benefit changes have adversely affected those with long tenure, C suite has made decisions without fair warning to the rest of the company, there is a lack of trust and communication between the decision makers and other employees. You can always find better pay and benefits by switching companies, but I have found the work life balance and flexibility to be very good at MITRE which I would not trade in for higher pay, plus knowing it’s a not-for-profit and I’m doing influential work is worth it to me. I worry a lot about the direction senior management is taking the company. The company hired a lot during the pandemic and liberally spent money on all sorts of things (including more VP positions)…but has been losing work in a number of large portfolios and seems to be struggling to find staff work. There are also a lot of projects MITRE gets in on that an FFRDC shouldn’t rightly be taking on. As many people also mention, senior leadership seems out of touch. As a fairly flat organization that encourages questioning and speaks truth to power, I really don’t understand why the CEO needs to explicitly exempt himself from wearing his badge around MITRE facilities. One of many condescending and belittling behaviors exhibited. Changes to PTO and benefits really have affected morale and engagement and it will take a couple of years for this to shake off completely. Long-term it may be okay but the recent changes concern me about trajectory and whether it will get worse. You can just get kicked off a project with no warning and no real reason except ""it wasn't in the budget anymore"" or ""we didn't get as much money from the sponsor as we wanted,"" and because MITRE is not-for-profit, there's no overhead charge code for that missing project time. You either need to scramble to find a new project or use your PTO to fill that allocation. There's also no guarantees to have project work once you get a job here. You have to continue to network and find work basically the whole time. Handling of the recent reduction in bankable vacation hours was horrible. Barely a month of notice to use it or lose it and their face-saver statement was “you aren’t losing it, you just stop accruing it”. Talk about Ministry of Truth. When a smaller reduction in bankable hours was made many years ago, we had 16 months to get below the new cap. Now we have to choose between losing vacation or failing to meet sponsor expectations/deadlines if we use weeks of vacation with zero notice. Modernization of financial tools was rushed and poorly planned by management. The financial worker bees busted their butts but were shoveling against the tide. The contractors were scared at how fast they were pushed to get their software working for MITRE. And the recent RIF of FAA supporting employees was done with one day notice by auto-gen email when those same skills are needed on the defense side which is hiring! No opportunity for them to find a new position on the defense side. Leadership at the top is making decisions that have made me lose confidence in their ability to lead. For reasons never fully shared with rank-and-file, leadership has turned the company 90 degrees toward ""sales outreach"" and ""non-govt business,"" burning hundreds of millions and chipping away at the prior fed-consulting cash cow by so doing. Said initiative's poor execution has resulted in end-of-year funding shortfalls, an abortive five-day November furlough, reduced holidays/vacation time, and a handful of quiet under-the-radar micro layoffs, all presented under the guise of ""We're in good shape, we're a very successful company, check us out on Google and Glassdoor, you'll see how competitive we are."" Hundreds of staff are currently scrabbling to find billable work, due to a mixture of paperwork logjams and billable-cost overruns. Another staff reduction is clearly imminent, despite management's demurrals and evasions. Under previous leadership this company used to be an amazing organization because they used to care about their employees. We used to win awards for being one of the best companies to work for. The retention rate is extremely high and MITRE does not care to keep you. They have lost so many incredible, talented people and under this new leadership, there attitude is don't let the door hit you on your way out. MITRE was never this way. They used to care. The current leadership cares nothing about employees who have tenure. Here's the huge disconnect -Before I begin, I worked at MITRE for over a decade, therefore I have no issues with changes. Change is Good if it benefits everyone! After all MITRE is MITRE because of the employees! Here's where the disconnect, MITRE has hired several external employees who do NOT know nor understand how this organization works. MITRE used to treat ALL employees with RESPECT. Although a large organization it used to once feel like a family/team working together to deliver outstanding quality work to our sponsors. Those days are long gone. As for me, it was time for me to go. When you undervalued, disrespected, unappreciated, it's time for you to choose you!

No opportunity for them to find a new position on the defense side. Leadership at the top is making decisions that have made me lose confidence in their ability to lead. Current leadership is seriously out of touch or is intentionally trying to drive away people with more than 5 years invested in the company. Communication is terrible. The CEO provides conflicting information from what is distributed. They waffle on decisions, execute poorly in a way to undermine confidence. Currently messaging says the company ""had the best year ever"" yet seems to be scrambling to try and reduce costs. The company doesn't seem to have an issue getting revenue, but they definitely have an issue over spending, particularly on internal investments focused under the labs construct. They seem to double down on failures vs. accepting that it was perhaps a bad idea and adjusting course.

You can always find better pay and benefits by switching companies, but I have found the work life balance and flexibility to be very good at MITRE which I would not trade in for higher pay, plus knowing it’s a not-for-profit and I’m doing influential work is worth it to me. I worry a lot about the direction senior management is taking the company. The company hired a lot during the pandemic and liberally spent money on all sorts of things (including more VP positions)…but has been losing work in a number of large portfolios and seems to be struggling to find staff work. There are also a lot of projects MITRE gets in on that an FFRDC shouldn’t rightly be taking on. As many people also mention, senior leadership seems out of touch. As a fairly flat organization that encourages questioning and speaks truth to power, I really don’t understand why the CEO needs to explicitly exempt himself from wearing his badge around MITRE facilities. One of many condescending and belittling behaviors exhibited. Changes to PTO and benefits really have affected morale and engagement and it will take a couple of years for this to shake off completely. Long-term it may be okay but the recent changes concern me about trajectory and whether it will get worse. You can just get kicked off a project with no warning and no real reason except ""it wasn't in the budget anymore"" or ""we didn't get as much money from the sponsor as we wanted,"" and because MITRE is not-for-profit, there's no overhead charge code for that missing project time. You either need to scramble to find a new project or use your PTO to fill that allocation. There's also no guarantees to have project work once you get a job here. You have to continue to network and find work basically the whole time. Handling of the recent reduction in bankable vacation hours was horrible. Barely a month of notice to use it or lose it and their face-saver statement was “you aren’t losing it, you just stop accruing it”. Talk about Ministry of Truth. When a smaller reduction in bankable hours was made many years ago, we had 16 months to get below the new cap. Now we have to choose between losing vacation or failing to meet sponsor expectations/deadlines if we use weeks of vacation with zero notice. Modernization of financial tools was rushed and poorly planned by management. The financial worker bees busted their butts but were shoveling against the tide. The contractors were scared at how fast they were pushed to get their software working for MITRE. And the recent RIF of FAA supporting employees was done with one day notice by auto-gen email when those same skills are needed on the defense side which is hiring! No opportunity for them to find a new position on the defense side. Leadership at the top is making decisions that have made me lose confidence in their ability to lead. For reasons never fully shared with rank-and-file, leadership has turned the company 90 degrees toward ""sales outreach"" and ""non-govt business,"" burning hundreds of millions and chipping away at the prior fed-consulting cash cow by so doing. Said initiative's poor execution has resulted in end-of-year funding shortfalls, an abortive five-day November furlough, reduced holidays/vacation time, and a handful of quiet under-the-radar micro layoffs, all presented under the guise of ""We're in good shape, we're a very successful company, check us out on Google and Glassdoor, you'll see how competitive we are."" Hundreds of staff are currently scrabbling to find billable work, due to a mixture of paperwork logjams and billable-cost overruns. Another staff reduction is clearly imminent, despite management's demurrals and evasions. Under previous leadership this company used to be an amazing organization because they used to care about their employees. We used to win awards for being one of the best companies to work for. The retention rate is extremely high and MITRE does not care to keep you. They have lost so many incredible, talented people and under this new leadership, there attitude is don't let the door hit you on your way out. MITRE was never this way. They used to care. The current leadership cares nothing about employees who have tenure. Here's the huge disconnect -Before I begin, I worked at MITRE for over a decade, therefore I have no issues with changes. Change is Good if it benefits everyone! After all MITRE is MITRE because of the employees! Here's where the disconnect, MITRE has hired several external employees who do NOT know nor understand how this organization works. MITRE used to treat ALL employees with RESPECT. Although a large organization it used to once feel like a family/team working together to deliver outstanding quality work to our sponsors. Those days are long gone. As for me, it was time for me to go. When you undervalued, disrespected, unappreciated, it's time for you to choose you! The CEO is tone deaf, condescending, and completely out of touch with his employees. The latest examples of this are: A CEO podcast in which he expressed surprise that employees were worried about cuts, stating that he was not aware of any cuts. This was less than a month after PTO cuts and a reduction in force of about 25 people. A new security policy where he, and he alone, is allowed to walk around the building without a badge, and security has been instructed not to challenge him. Literally everyone else must wear a badge. A later CEO podcast in which he and his interviewer commiserated that poor reviews on this website can bring morale down, without addressing the concerns brought up in those reviews, which mostly revolve around him and the rest of the C-suite. Employees were told that a recent all-hands meeting would be followed by a CEO call in which we could ask questions about what we'd heard. That CEO call was canceled and has not been rescheduled. I am hoping that is because our board of directors is finally pulling their heads out of the sand and taking action to address his issues, but my hopes are not terribly high, as they have appeared disinclined to take any action to date. - continual need to job hunt ( every ~6 months or so) to maintain contract coverage, can be extremely nerve-wracking as you're also expected to network and find jobs for those that work under you - year after year we've seen reduction in benefits, given that salary is lower than comparable private sector companies that makes the company less attractive - company is spread far apart (you'll often be on teams with people located in several different teams), but leadership is gradually enforcing more RTO measuresdependency on federal funding can cause stress during Congressional budget and debt ceiling debates Too many VP,s that are not held accountable. Company recently RIF'd 24 staff from FAA FFRDC, due to dropping gov't funding...yet company has significant number of VPs all sucking off of overhead. No attempt to manage money within the ""leadership"" ranks. Last year company went through a major business transformation...that failed...yet, VPs held staff accountable for reporting on a subpar system that lasted over 12 months. Could not even get business data to report to gov't for over 2 months, yet, person who was in charge of the business transformation is still at MITRE. If this happened to any other MITRE employee, they would've been gone. Oddly enough the person in charge of the business transformation is the CEOs brother. Amazing how that happens. He'll probably get a bonus because of his substandard performance. MITRE recently invested in opening up an office in Australia. All on company overhead. significant large numbers of VPs travelling out to ""visit""...yet company has the audacity to reduce benefits as part of cost cutting measures. Company has now taken on a ""for profit"" mentality. It's all about delivery... so VPS and GMs can spend, spend, spend. Board of Directors should take a good look at what is happening and make some swift changes from the CEO on down.

Current leadership is seriously out of touch or is intentionally trying to drive away people with more than 5 years invested in the company. Communication is terrible. The CEO provides conflicting information from what is distributed. They waffle on decisions, execute poorly in a way to undermine confidence. Currently messaging says the company ""had the best year ever"" yet seems to be scrambling to try and reduce costs.

The uniform sucks It's a large company so it's easy to go unnoticed unless you speak up. -Hours are inconsistent, especially after the holidays -The dress code -without bonuses you are making minimum wage Bonus plan, communication from upper management, inability to further your career within the company Can be competitive and catty at times."

Thank you again Stericycle! Stericycle is a strong brand in the medical waste industry. There is a lot of pride in what we do with the impact on the environment and thought leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance. At Stericycle, team members can see the difference they make on a daily basis. There is a strong DEI initiative with 7 employee resources groups. These groups allow participants to strategize and drive positive change and come together as like minded individuals to increase belonging and safety. At Stericycle there's an ability to grow a career. Team members are given a chance to demonstrate skills and try new ones based on previous behavior. There's a lot of emphasis on learning.

Some of our internal processes are over complicated but it's seems we are trying to make improvements to speed things up. They don't pay their employees for the work they put on them, train the Shred-it employees on the whole other side of the business medical waste without a raise. No team outings or bonding No raise Unrealistic expectations sometimes Training is more catered towards outbound sales instead of inbound Unable to prospect for customers or cold call you mostly have to wait for calls to come to you or follow up with customers bc there is an outbound team so if the call volume is low it can be kinda hard to meet the sales goal at times but it also is nice not having to cold call & letting all the calls come to you Sometimes a lot of pressure is put on by management to achiever certain goals but they aren’t doing what is needed to be done for the workers to be successful so that the goal can be easier to achieve Customer service sucks & that’s who you work with majority of the time It’s overall just boring, nothing exciting about the job at all I’ve been here for almost 2 years & haven’t even made friends really because we don’t do anything as a staff really or have any real fun interactions everyone is kinda to themselves which some may find enjoyable but I’m a people person which is why I got into sales so sometimes it feels a little boring Hours are early and hard to adjust to Lots of disgruntled customers due to services not being performed when scheduled, not to mention due to system changes their accounts weren't accurate or sometimes duplicated in the system. The pay was not commiserated with the level of aggravation dealt with daily. I have 10+ years in the Talent Acquisition field and leaned you get out of the job what you put into it. There are cons in every company however you can overcome them by working hard and versatile to show your value. Left alone until a problem would come up. The problem is also always your fault. I am writing this review to share the unfortunate experience of a close friend who worked at Stericycle. It deeply saddens me to recount the challenges they faced during their employment, and I believe it is crucial to shed light on their ordeal. My friend was initially attracted to Stericycle based on the promises made during the hiring process. However, their time at the company turned out to be far from what was expected. One of the most concerning aspects was the discrepancy between what was communicated and the actual work schedule. Stericycle had assured them of a four-day training period with 10-hour shifts. To their dismay, the reality was quite different, as they were overloaded with a five-day workweek consisting of 10-hour shifts. This change placed an immense physical and mental strain on them. What truly disappointed my friend was Stericycle's lack of consideration for their family's needs. Despite providing prior notice and arranging for their daughter's daycare pick-up at a specific time, these arrangements were disregarded. Instead, they were assigned routes that consistently extended beyond the 10-hour time frame, making it challenging to fulfill their family responsibilities. This disregard for work-life balance and the impact on their personal life was disheartening. My friend had high hopes for Stericycle's proclaimed open-door policy and understanding regarding emergencies. Regrettably, this proved to be far from the truth. Management displayed a lack of responsiveness and failed to address urgent concerns adequately. The promised support and empathy were absent when they needed it the most. Furthermore, my friend shared concerns about their safety while on the job. Stericycle assigned them tasks that were beyond the scope of their initial role, which raised concerns about compliance and put their driver's license at risk. This disregard for safety protocols is deeply troubling and should not be taken lightly. Based on my friend's first-hand experience, I cannot recommend considering employment at Stericycle. The treatment they endured, the lack of work-life balance, and the management's indifference to their concerns paint a picture of an unsupportive work environment. I hope sharing this account serves as a cautionary tale for others contemplating a career with Stericycle. The sales team on the floor were actively yelled at by the management, there was a boiler room culture, and sales reps were training us on how to cut corners, manipulate contract terms, and/or reframe the services/value in ways that weren't transparent.I don't have anything bad to say about Stericycle.

SAS offers a variety of unique perks and benefits to employees, but favorites include the option of a PPO medical plan and onsite Health Care Center, hybrid work, generous PTO (including a company shutdown between Christmas and New Year's) and subsidized onsite cafés. Beyond the perks, there’s ample opportunity for internal mobility and career development, and my managers have been exceptionally supportive – not just of me as an employee, but as a whole person. Employee well-being is emphasized at SAS, and employees are empowered to balance work and life. The people are second to none, and it’s a very friendly and collaborative environment. It's an exciting time to be at SAS, particularly as the company approaches IPO-readiness. -Great benefits and flexible work environment -Campus is amazing Possible IPO, some very nice colleagues SAS values work-life balance consistently. Impressive Work-Life Balance: One of the most striking aspects of working at SAS is the excellent work-life balance. The company genuinely values the well-being of its employees and encourages a healthy lifestyle. Flexible hours, remote work options, and a supportive management team all contribute to an enjoyable and stress-free work environment. Wonderful Teammates: The camaraderie and support provided by my colleagues at SAS have been exceptional. Team members are friendly, helpful, and committed to working collaboratively. The positive atmosphere fostered by my coworkers has made coming to work each day a pleasure. No Pros at all. Be ready to be verbally abused by your manager and do not expect any help at all. Very good benefits - the one high point SAS is super flexible and understands the balance of work vs. life. Never had an issue. Flexible work environment, interesting work SAS offers great pay and benefits. The campus is beautiful as well.Prior to working at SAS, I always heard that SAS was a great place to work.

Promotions are often given based on an employee's length of time in the job, rather than actual job performance and output. Supposedly there will be an IPO and supposedly employees will benefit too. But it only came about when the founders and owners of the company failed to agree on price when they tried to sell SAS a couple of years ago. These same leaders waxed on over the years about how valuable employees were, only to try and sell the company to another company known for gutting their acquisitions and laying people off. I’m a very long term employee and I truly used to believe SAS was the best place to work. I bragged and felt lucky to work at SAS, but those feelings are completely gone. I’m just waiting now to see what happens. I don’t hold out much hope that employees will be treated well. What a sad end to what could have been a great legacy. I’m no fool, I’ll take the money (I’ve earned it after all the years of working well over the “35 hour work week” on non-competitive pay rates), but I’ll never forget the betrayal of employees by senior management. Might pay slightly less than other technology companies, but you get a lot of perks, especially working in the HQ office. Lots of change right now. Below-Average Compensation: While the work-life balance is certainly a highlight, the compensation package at SAS leaves much to be desired. Salaries are not competitive with industry standards, making it difficult to feel truly valued for the work we put in. This could lead to a higher turnover rate as employees seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere. Limited Transferable Skills: Unfortunately, the nature of the work at SAS does not provide many opportunities for employees to develop transferable skills. The tasks can be repetitive, and the learning curve tends to plateau after a short time. This may hinder professional growth and make it challenging to transition into new roles or industries.

I am sure the experience is location specific, but this was a great first job in high school. I would recommend it to individuals who are driven and patient! - Was never bored as a tutor. In this aspect it definitely beats have some office job where you have to fill out spreadsheets. You're constantly solving problems, talking with a kid, moving around. - Pretty satisfying to teach kids, encourage them to focus, joke with them. The kids I had were always pretty well behaved and I had support. It's like teaching without all the frustration. - get to to meet interesting coworkers - had a great manager, who was patient when I made mistakes and tried to work on me eventually getting promoted (though I didn't stay long enough for that, I was there for like 8 months). She practiced a system where the tutors would alternate managing each other to get leadership experience, not sure if that's standard or not. - flexible on hours. Before peak hours, it's sometimes possible to get someone to cover you for a half hour or so, and after peak hours you can choose who goes home early. Connecting with students, helping them understand math, improving families' home lives because of reduced math-related stress Excellent training, support, and management Sheets are already made by the company (so it's very little prep work for you as the tutor) Laid back atmosphere Lots of freedom and flexibility work life balance decent pay team oriented management is awesome - Well organized - Positive work environment - Incredible boss - Employee feedback is listened to This is the most rewarding and less stressful job I have ever had. The kids are great for the most part as long as you understand many aren't going to want to be there. If you can connect with them and relate some, it makes it much easier for everyone. The Mathnasium content was flexible and efficient that allowed for students to be easily enrolled and dropped off, which made managing the center a lot easier. The Mathnasium curriculum is very effective at teaching students math. The process through which work hours are created is fair and transparent. There are plenty of opportunities to network in the education field. The small group environment allows instructors to effectively track student progress. There is a routine to instruction which makes the day flow very nicely. I have thoroughly enjoyed and benefitted from my time working at Mathnasium. I have met many great people who are or were instructors, center directors, and franchise owners. I am very proud that I had the opportunity to work with these people. I am a much more capable and competent Math Teacher because of my experience working with them.Anyone over 18 gets $14 an hr and anyone with a college degree gets $15 an hr - Was never bored as a tutor.

I am a much more capable and competent Math Teacher because of my experience working with them.Anyone over 18 gets $14 an hr and anyone with a college degree gets $15 an hr This was a great job. I am sure the experience is location specific, but this was a great first job in high school. I would recommend it to individuals who are driven and patient! - Was never bored as a tutor. In this aspect it definitely beats have some office job where you have to fill out spreadsheets. You're constantly solving problems, talking with a kid, moving around. - Pretty satisfying to teach kids, encourage them to focus, joke with them. The kids I had were always pretty well behaved and I had support. It's like teaching without all the frustration. - get to to meet interesting coworkers - had a great manager, who was patient when I made mistakes and tried to work on me eventually getting promoted (though I didn't stay long enough for that, I was there for like 8 months). She practiced a system where the tutors would alternate managing each other to get leadership experience, not sure if that's standard or not. - flexible on hours.

The kids are great for the most part as long as you understand many aren't going to want to be there. If you can connect with them and relate some, it makes it much easier for everyone.

This meant we (the $14/hr or less, possibly volunteer) instructors had to do cleaning chores associated with the $20/hr managerial position. 2. Having no manager meant that when there were issues with decks needing updates or parents with complaints, we had to call the other store or use Slack. 3. Having no manager meant that we were sometimes LOCKED IN THE STORE WITH THE KIDS. I was the only adult in the building multiple times. We had to escort the children around the back, in an unlit parking lot. 4. I was told I would be getting a raise, as I did the work of a Level 3 instructor as a Level 1 hire. I was never given a raise, nor training for the higher level. 5. As all your coworkers are high schoolers, they are often unreliable or sick. Thus management is always asking you to pick up shifts. - not very motivating to move upwards - difficult studentsNot a lot of hours but has very flexible scheduling You will work with a range of kids. This becomes easier as you progress into the position but at first it can be overwhelming. - pay could be higher. Was making $12.50/hr. May have gone up since I was working there - working during COVID pandemic meant a lot of extra cleaning tasks than would usually exist. They're not hard at all, but you have to remember to do them in a particular way and order very frequently, and they're very easy to slip your mind. There was no extra pay for having these extra tasks. - Even without COVID, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the regular cleaning/organizational/time management tasks. Again, not hard at all, you just have to have that schedule down to a tee. Low pay, unpredictable hours, being required to devote time outside of work hours to the company. You are assigned an abundance of tasks, which are not able to be completed within your scheduled hours. If you stay a few minutes later to finish your task, your pay is cut so that ""we aren't over payroll."" Low pay for the quality of work (especially when tutoring higher grade levels such as algebra) only evening shifts as we are open later in the day - Doesn't pay very well - A lot of high schoolers work there The pay and the hours. At time of hiring I set the minimum number of hours I would need, it was agreed upon. I've maybe achieved that many hours once. I stayed only because as my pro said, I like the level of stress and had many other things going. The content had a problem of being focused on too many rout worksheets since it was harder to manage the more fun activities with the individualized learning The work environment is great, but Mathnasium Corporate should dedicate more resources to developing and increasing compensation for employees. This will guarantee the high-quality instruction expected from Instructors and Center Directors.Not a lot of hours but has very flexible scheduling You will work with a range of kids.

There are many siloed teams, which come with cross functional teams, and some employee's. There is a lack of ability to think outside of box or think critically.

Amazing place to advance Local management all the way up to senior level management has major room for improvement on showing gratitude for employees. Endless conference calls. Extreme micromanagement. Unattainable goals. Little to no support. Never hear thank you or good job even with above expectation results. Sub par tools to do the job. Lacking in on the job training as well. Throw you to the fire and figure it out type of mentality. Left in tears several days over the many years I was there. - In most cases, you begin in an entry position but for a good cause-to learn the industry and what Ryder does however, this may be an unfavorable option in some peoples eyes. - The health and dental insurance could be better and the rates could be lower. - Average salary pay but upside is commissions are good - If you leave - on good terms of course - you may encounter some challenges getting back in if you wanted..mostly due to those being grandfathered in for promotion and prepped for the next role. - Rental is the underdog but caters to pretty much all product lines so you’ll work your a** off but it’s rewarding (or so was for me, I loved it but some may not). Low salaries, new location, no bonus Long work hours but working in cyber security that is to be expected. At this time there is not enough volume coming or going out to support a full time schedule. There was high hopes of nee clients, but not probable enough to sustain a healthy, needed income. For years I worked 50-60+ hours, now barely 30. Somewhat outdated process but working to bring it forward There are no cons working here.Theres no cons about this place None.

For years I worked 50-60+ hours, now barely 30. Somewhat outdated process but working to bring it forward There are no cons working here. The management micromanaged. They always wanted a scapegoat, I went from being confident 100% in my role to not being able to make a decision unless it went through them. The base pay is abysmal and not based on the current cost of living. Despite constant negative feedback regarding poor compensation executive management digs in its heels, insisting it pays very well. The pay was fair in 2018 but in 2023 it is woefully insufficient. There are no cost of living increases. You'll be lucky to receive a 2% annual raise regardless of how much tenure you have. Upper management seems totally disconnected from those of us on the frontlines. They make unnecessary changes that only make the job more unpleasant - like unveiling a brand new website that wasn't needed and did not work at all. At one point in time, when the economy was good and the department was young I thought I'd found a career at a great organization. As time has gone on it is obvious that it is just another dead end job Offer more money for the positionTheres no cons about this place - In most cases, you begin in an entry position but for a good cause-to learn the industry and what Ryder does however, this may be an unfavorable option in some peoples eyes. - The health and dental insurance could be better and the rates could be lower. - Average salary pay but upside is commissions are good - If you leave - on good terms of course - you may encounter some challenges getting back in if you wanted..mostly due to those being grandfathered in for promotion and prepped for the next role. - Rental is the underdog but caters to pretty much all product lines so you’ll work your a** off but it’s rewarding (or so was for me, I loved it but some may not). Local management all the way up to senior level management has major room for improvement on showing gratitude for employees. Endless conference calls. Extreme micromanagement. Unattainable goals. Little to no support. Never hear thank you or good job even with above expectation results. Sub par tools to do the job. Lacking in on the job training as well.

For Chicago and the work load, the pay could be alot better Alight went from a private to public company. I believe they were overly optimistic believing they would have more business, hence they hired additional staff they did not need. I was one of those people. Lots of upper middle managers and sales staff were laid off. Alight stopped matching 401K for executives and upper management. When this happens you know its only a matter of time before line staff get laid off. There just wasn't enough work in my department. Alight has a high percentage of female employees so there's lots of ""Feelings"" and ""DEI"" language. Be prepared to change teams. In changing teams some of you new TMs may not be as supportive as last. Expect to have minimum support. The pay is still low for starting pay and if we could bring it up you would get better and more potential candidates. Even when we meet the previous year's revenue goals and meet our own performance goals, the company doesn't always pay out our full bonus. Also, in the four years I've been here, only once did I receive a COLA raise. Otherwise it's been under 2% each year - despite my ""stellar"" performance reviews, extensive experience and going above and beyond my role, I have not received a promotion or a raise to meet my colleagues' salary levels ""due to budget concerns."" Also, ""employees are completely in charge of their career paths,"" which is a good way for management to have an excuse not to advocate for your career path even when you go through the process to define and discuss your career ambitions with your manager. Granted, some managers are good managers and champion their employees, but if your manager is lazy you get nowhere. Be prepared to be on the bottom of a totem pole. You have to take and give bad news and have absolutely no power to help in realtime. You are stuck making tickets, this is compounded by a semi-incompetent processing team, which is fully outsourced to other countries. You are lucky if you get one good agent from that end out of ten tickets, meaning you are able to get things resolved without having to push it back to them more than once. Time delays receiving and sending documentation It's difficult to tell who this company is in the service of, the employees or the companies? Re: Benefits/ Diversity / Career. They talk a good game about how they're diverse and open to growth and provide benefits. But this is all extremely generous use of those terms. Benefits are geographic-specific, diversity is in the form of their staff photos (but has no real bearing on work anyway). Career growth is going to be extremely stifled if you get good. It's a catch-22 of learning to get good at your job, to then be too skilled to let go of, or have some new hyper-specific requirement thrown at you that requires both skill and luck somehow to meet, once.

You might have to be overly outgoing and friendly, which can sometimes annoy customers. Very poor management. Many teams are structured where there is no opportunity for promotion and a high number of people feel stuck with the company waiting 5+ years for a promotion over due. leadership may never be ”allowed” to allocate budget to promote you due to how the teams and budget are structured together. This company is way too small in head count for what it creates. A lot of teams are working major overtime covering for coworkers who have quit or walked out or simply the lack of budget to hire the help needed for a functioning work place. I’ve never seen this type of disorganization at a corporate headquarter’s level before. Don’t recommend working here any time soon Reduced corporate staff + hiring freeze leaves everyone with already full plates with no added compensation for much added workload. RTO is awful with a lack of conference rooms and cross functional teams located around the globe, and people taking calls on headsets sitting right next to one another. So much for in-person collaboration. I had some medical complications that resulted in me not being able to work for a while, and when I came back, they only ever had me in the back room sealed away, and slowly begin cutting my hours less and less and less until I was lucky to get four hours a week. The claim hours are based on performance, yet when I am in the back or the fitting room for every single shift, I can’t make sales. The turnover rate for this job is God awful if you’re just a normal employee. I stuck around as long as I could, but towards the end, aside from management there wasn’t a single person working there that was working there when I started. Hard to get hired, lots of nepotism. They use job seekers as cannon fodder, they schedule interviews when they already have chosen a candidate to fill the position. If you manage to get hired, managers play favorites giving the most hours to their friends. They blatantly play favorites. Led by older generation that is out of touch with the current market trends Little room for advancement unless you relocate to San Fransisco; remote positions are no longer available No reward/recognition for hard working/high achievers US has not had a field leadership conference in 5 years Dont pay enough for the workload. pay should be higher for my responsibilities and for my contribution to the success of the company. one con might be that it is a smaller teamRight now at this time I don't have any negative comments to say.

My official title was Associate Clinical Research Data Specialist for almost two year then moved to be a Coordinator with that raise and essentially was doing the exact same work as even the coordinator 3. Cannot speak on management for every department, but can make or break. Bad management that provided little to no help and also offering no good critical thought out solutions to the problems at hand. Process inefficiency abounds, sometimes it is difficult to communicate areas that need improvement Extremely beaurocratic and old fashioned. I think men still have to wear ties in some departments. You also have a lot of the public wandering around because it's an open medical facility, which can be not so great.

Despite cries for resources the answer is always the same, more middle management. All of this creates an ongoing serious risk to patient care and safety. Hours Bad management Treated as a number instead of a person Very individual, not a lot of ability to connectlStaff burnout is high High employee turnover This might be an overall issue within clinical research as a whole at Vanderbilt, but the pipeline for growth is very minuscule. The pay is not competitive, and growth takes awhile. The growth is also very minimal and may result in just a $2 raise per hour - which is what happened to me after almost two years. My official title was Associate Clinical Research Data Specialist for almost two year then moved to be a Coordinator with that raise and essentially was doing the exact same work as even the coordinator 3. Cannot speak on management for every department, but can make or break. Bad management that provided little to no help and also offering no good critical thought out solutions to the problems at hand. Process inefficiency abounds, sometimes it is difficult to communicate areas that need improvement Extremely beaurocratic and old fashioned. I think men still have to wear ties in some departments. You also have a lot of the public wandering around because it's an open medical facility, which can be not so great. Very individual, not a lot of ability to connectl demanding, obsessed w/ data, and thesse No cons at this current time. Not enough public transportation across campus. If you’re a person of color, you won’t find many people that look like you especially in the ICU on staff or upward in management The culture is driven with fragility and microagressions If you don’t assimilate, you will be on an island on your own - making it hard for you to get asked for any advanced training You have to keep your head on a swivel and speak up for yourself - keep a written record They pick and choose who and when to enforce policies - some they make up on the fly Minimal growth in social work role"
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Home-Instead-Reviews-E592979.htm,"Love the staff and owner *Make your own schedule with ability to change availability each pay period. *Decent pay for the industry. *Good support system in the office. *You know exactly what is expected of you and what to expect at the client's house before you arrive. The clients are the best part The staff is very friendly. They really care about the clients. If you need extra hours, you can get them easily. The job was pretty laid back and working with the clients was rewarding. None whatsoever at all fareal, want to give zero stars. I enjoyed helping elderly though at times it was demanding, $25 bonus for Christmas was given to all employees. You get to pick your own hours and opportunities to accept other jobs where people called in sick and they offer a decent bonus incentive sometimes on that. -Clients are very nice -Clients show much appreciation and gratitude -If the pay day falls on Saturday, then you get paid Friday -Tap check allows you to cashout money from a shift the very next day, for a fee A great mission to help seniors in their home. Strong established history of empathy, care, and family values. This is the company that started the in-home car industry after all. Friendly office staff to work with","Not enough clients at times *Most of the client shifts are short shifts (3-5 hours) so you must do multiple shifts in a day to achieve a 40 hour work week. *Gas mileage isn't a thing they give unless going over 20 miles, or on call. Even if going to multiple shifts a day. *Given the nature of the work, the consistency of pay can be tough. If a regular client goes into a treatment facility(hospital, rehab, assisted living facility, etc.) you lose hours and pay you rely on, making budgeting difficult. You are able to pick up open shifts, if they are available and will fit with your other existing shifts. *Management is not always transparent when asked questions they don't wish to answer. I've been talked in circles before and had simple things overexplained, but still leaving my question unanswered. So many rules that it makes it hard to be human… I had a situation where my client had to put her dog down… the vet called 15 minutes before I was due to leave and told client that the dog had stomach cancer and needed to be put down sooner rather than later….my client understandably was so upset… crying and rocking that little dog… I stayed 15 minutes over my scheduled time to leave… but clocked out on time… the 15 minutes was in my time! We were waiting on her neighbor to come take her and dog to the vet…. I cldnt leave an 80 year old woman sobbing… what was I supposed to do? Say “sorry your upset but I have to leave”…. I could never do that to someone! Needless to say I got in trouble for staying They call constantly on days off. You can work 40 hours a week or more and you're still considered a ""part-time"" employee with no benefits. The pay is low for the seriousness of the work (medical care - even though they say you don't provide this, you do) and use of your personal vehicle. There was not enough staff and often had to cover for people. Don’t return calls after surgery to get you back on schedule. Has a stupid voicemail system where you have to leave a message to a 3rd party to get a return call back. Need to have a supervisor on call at all times, not just when it’s convenient for them to be home snuggled in bed. Places you with clients that they know you can’t lift without assistance from another person when they are bed bound. 1 week vacation time per year, also no training, I just got thrown in and done my best. -Front office can be very rude -Front office can make alot of passive-aggressive comments -Only get paid 2 times a month Going through many changes. 3 layoffs in a 2 years even after considerable profits. Since being purchased by Honor, Inc, the ""to us it's personal"" tag line doesn't fit as well as it used to at headquarters. The company had an extremely strong culture that has been reduced considerably. Still not a bad company, just a company in transformation and not the standout it used to be. -Owners will mislead you -Owners will extort your talents -Owners are not capable of running a successful business -Owners will hire you for Human Resources and demand you do Caregiving, which involves changing the diapers of the elderly, maid services, bathing, hospice care, etc. -Not a good place to work if you are a professional."

Flexible schedule & unlimited earning potential In depth training process and expectations","I feel sometimes the work can feel like it follows you home/ days off. But, if you stay organized and on top of things then you’ll be fine. Not a very flexible schedule. Still politics of getting promoted. Can get really bored during downtime. Due to type of job you may have other ignorant kids working with you that are lazy. Losing money for other reps being lazy and not counting accessories is crazy. Some chargebacks suck but you can still earn a very high amount. I was with the company for 6 years. They pride themselves on “great work culture” and “home/life balance.” There is no PTO. No vacation time. They do NOT pay you for meetings, and they are mandatory to attend. They are 6am, biweekly, and at a store up to 2 hours away. They schedule meetings, with 2 days notice, on school days and recommend bringing your kids to the 6am meeting 2 hours away, then driving them to school. They take money from your commissions with no heads up and cannot provide a reason. They force employees to leave fake google reviews to make the company look better than it is. They also force employees to use customers phones to leave fake google reviews without their knowledge. If the company loses a phone, or is a victim of theft, that money comes out of your commission check. Even if it wasn’t your fault, if you were clocked in at all during that day, you have to eat the cost of lost product- this includes FedEx boxes that show up empty. Management encourages unethical selling tactics. Drama. General manager is never helpful and very distant. He also is not for the employees, he’s for himself. You will have to sell some products and services (verizon visa card, insurance, etc.) that make a lot per each sold, but aren't really a great decision for the customer, which can lead to some customer resentment. You will miss out on comms if you are stuck helping a customer instead of selling. This encourages reps to skimp out on helping people with advanced devices, especially the elderly, in favor of making more money. HOWEVER, if the customer is not satisfied with your help in any way and decides to leave a nasty review, you will be in the line of fire with management. In rural/low traffic markets, you will be forced to use tactics that the top 10% of reps use just to survive. It makes you a better salesperson, but the rewards are not as plentiful. I made 54k gross my first year and 32k the second because I worked in a low traffic area (my hometown.) You also will need to drink the koolaid a fair bit to even think about getting anywhere on the ladder, but keep in mind that if you are a hunter who needs to be pulled back some, you will probably be okay vs a gatherer that needs a little push here and there. You will be expected to push a high profit device on every person that enters, including people that cannot afford it. Management is sometimes not there, Verizon will treat you like a step child and they are trying to cut you it of the picture. The reason they keep us is that we sell more than they do as a company. Love hate relationship truly. Just like everyone else has expressed management is full of money hungry individuals that will sacrifice the happiness of staff for their fancy houses & cars. You are “expendable” to them. You will probably be a victim to their terrible management making an uncomfortable work environment. Also you will have to deal with being tossed around in scheduling to make up for the very high employee turnover rate at Cellular Sales. If there arent any customers prepare to owe this company your hourly draw at the end of every month. Culture is lacking, sales process is undefined, upward mobility is limited From my experience, commissions kept changing in a way to not better the employee.

Some chargebacks suck but you can still earn a very high amount. I was with the company for 6 years. They pride themselves on “great work culture” and “home/life balance.” There is no PTO. No vacation time. They do NOT pay you for meetings, and they are mandatory to attend. They are 6am, biweekly, and at a store up to 2 hours away. They schedule meetings, with 2 days notice, on school days and recommend bringing your kids to the 6am meeting 2 hours away, then driving them to school. They take money from your commissions with no heads up and cannot provide a reason. They force employees to leave fake google reviews to make the company look better than it is. They also force employees to use customers phones to leave fake google reviews without their knowledge. If the company loses a phone, or is a victim of theft, that money comes out of your commission check. Even if it wasn’t your fault, if you were clocked in at all during that day, you have to eat the cost of lost product- this includes FedEx boxes that show up empty. Management encourages unethical selling tactics. Management is sometimes not there, Verizon will treat you like a step child and they are trying to cut you it of the picture. The reason they keep us is that we sell more than they do as a company. Love hate relationship truly. From my experience, commissions kept changing in a way to not better the employee. When I started it was earn your own commission, then it changed to work for everyone else on the sales floor in hopes they would put in as much effort. Some months are bad. Need a saving to start because first commission check will be your 3rd month Drama. General manager is never helpful and very distant. He also is not for the employees, he’s for himself. You will have to sell some products and services (verizon visa card, insurance, etc.) that make a lot per each sold, but aren't really a great decision for the customer, which can lead to some customer resentment. You will miss out on comms if you are stuck helping a customer instead of selling. This encourages reps to skimp out on helping people with advanced devices, especially the elderly, in favor of making more money. HOWEVER, if the customer is not satisfied with your help in any way and decides to leave a nasty review, you will be in the line of fire with management. In rural/low traffic markets, you will be forced to use tactics that the top 10% of reps use just to survive. It makes you a better salesperson, but the rewards are not as plentiful. I made 54k gross my first year and 32k the second because I worked in a low traffic area (my hometown.) You also will need to drink the koolaid a fair bit to even think about getting anywhere on the ladder, but keep in mind that if you are a hunter who needs to be pulled back some, you will probably be okay vs a gatherer that needs a little push here and there. You will be expected to push a high profit device on every person that enters, including people that cannot afford it. Just like everyone else has expressed management is full of money hungry individuals that will sacrifice the happiness of staff for their fancy houses & cars. You are “expendable” to them. You will probably be a victim to their terrible management making an uncomfortable work environment. Also you will have to deal with being tossed around in scheduling to make up for the very high employee turnover rate at Cellular Sales. If there arent any customers prepare to owe this company your hourly draw at the end of every month.I feel sometimes the work can feel like it follows you home/ days off.

Very profitable job until str became ban in most cities Compensation is nearly 2x my last role. Brilliant talent. Remote flexibility is amazing. Work/life balance is a real priority. Company values of belonging aren't just lip service, they actually carry over in all the little ways, which I've never seen before. Solving challenging and complex problems. I truly do like my job, and would like to stay here for a really really long time. The culture is pretty good.

No hybrid would be nice The value of design and service design is seriously underestimated in the organization FL market limited Managers stretched thin - limited time for position development Way too many legacy employees, which comes with great corp knowledge but refuse to adapt to tech still navigating post-merger integration, systems, policy, management style etc. Company tech needs drastic improvement. Truist recently raised the minimum wage to $22 p/ hour for incoming employees, as well as those who were already receiving less. Meanwhile, the long time employees that have been working here for several years received 5%. This worked out so that some teammates at one year were making a salary comparable to a person who had been there 15 years, etc. We were told to be grateful for the 5% which brought us extremely close to the salary of the new hires. In addition, the “back to work” approach (post Covid) showed no compassion or ease for the teammates who have grown accustomed to the work from home conditions. Going from work from home for two years and then back to office was extremely hard for those who developed social anxiety/depression during the pandemic. Last, PTO for sick/personal use is offered but rarely used as the company has a way of guilting you heavily for using it. People behind the scenes (who have never worked in a branch) stating if a branch has enough staff. They promote work/life balance, but we work 6 days straight while neighboring branches are closed on the weekends. They forced the teller line to to do banker responsibilities without hiring extra help. We're to spend 20+ minutes with each client while the line goes out the door and then get penalized for VOC? You added extra duties but denied us a raise and told us ""If you don't want it Truist will consider this your 2 weeks"". My supervisor read it straight from the paper. We could transfer, but you put a hiring freeze on. The teller line deals with all the complaints and you abuse them. And then you raised the incentive quota to 90%? Were not robots. They lie about caring for people over profit. They treat employees like possessions. They don't provide a work-life balance. So many employees have quit due to toxic workplace with poor management and unreasonable demands for productivity and quality. Every area is understaffed. It's a revolving door and they don't care. People are expendable and hours are long and grueling. Vacation and pto for wellness and health is benefits that you will need to fight to use. Poor training methods and old technology bog down processes. Every day is negative reinforcement. Low level inexperienced managers act like drill sergeants. Always threatening written or verbal warnings and termination. Staffing! My branch is down to a branch leader, me, and 2 part time. We are a very busy branch that needs double that to survive. Due to lack of staffing, going home every night exhausted due to the steady stream of clients from open to close. I have to sneak away for lunch before a client or teammate sees me and stops me with an issue or problem. Getting CCGs and calls made isn't happening due to constant stream of clients, but upper management will ask why they aren't done. I would love for Dante or Alison or area leaders to spend a day in my shoes to see what the refusal to hire people has done to us in the branches. I have zero work/life balance due to being constantly exhausted. As the merger between BB&T & SunTrust progressed, my position was mapped to a ""demotion"". On top of my career resetting 8+ years, we were not given raises across the board to ""fund the merger"". More people took the exit packages (for eligible heritage employees) than expected and our workloads increased with no help to offset - there was a hiring freeze for our teams until after the merger was complete. As the merger dust settled, many BB&T senior managers and directors were out and SunTrust leaders placed in their positions. The morale of employees sunk and the positive culture ""left the building"".Not very organized training regimen.

The value of design and service design is seriously underestimated in the organization Work on-site 3 days a week (when job functions do not require on-site at all)/no option to work more from home, work/life balance is lacking (was much better when worked strictly from home), salary is lower than average for job title (esp for experience/years of experience), dept budget restraints prevent decent merit increases (though the bank overall is pulling large profits quarterly) The management at the TCC is cutthroat. If you don't fit in with their culture and aren't in their circle, be prepared to be let go. Also the management has free reign to lie to you. If you're being asked to come on-site for a mid year review that's more often than not code for ""be prepared to be let go"".Not very organized training regimen.

Very cut throat. upper field management happened to only show their face when something was wrong or they needed to impress THEIR boss with how well the delegated THEIR duties as a RGM/DM. More often than not I happened to take on duties that were not my responsibility due to short staffing and everyone required to ""wear more than one hat"". Skeleton crews were a VERY harsh reality after the pandemic even though the amount of customers never changed. The conversation around credit cards and the amount of sign ups we were required to get in store happened to be extremely unreasonable and not equal throat the district. There were many times that our store happened to be on the ""bad list"" because of having ""no card days"". There were multiple changes in management and nothing ever stayed the same from one manager to the next. No new manager wanted to follow proper protocols or guidelines. - c-level or senior leadership out of touch - lack of merchandising direction - faltering sales revenue - old technology - no room for advancement not enough money and attention given to improve the culture at distribution centers. It's really sad. not much movement in support functions, and it really depends who you know as to whether or not you can have a door opened to you. pto is not as competitive or attractive in comparison to other companies you can work for - they should have more maternity leave isn't great. unless you live in europe, again, it's not as progressive as what you hope for. - drastically underpay compared to market rates - minimal bonuses - if the company doesn't do good, expect an even smaller bonus - does not award based on hard work or merit - no room for career opportunities - will hire contractors before hiring FTE - has been a dying company: visible by the effort from every level -design culture is lead by fear -relocated me during a pandemic under a 2-year contract and let me go just shy of 2 years along w/ 1800 other people -lost potential on shaky deals made without authenticity -does not follow brand mottos: WTLB or inclusive, by design - leadership turnover - changing strategy - lack of urgency - the overall company is not doing well - layoffs (positions eliminated without being thoughtful. Just deep cuts. Over 25%) Health insurance options can be better You get a lot of calls and occasionally some very rude customers- not much in terms of cons... generally retail is not as competitive in terms of comp as compared to some other industries (tech etc)., but for a large multi brand retailer, the benefits and pay are competitive and the work is complex and interesting A very strong political environment.

Lets start off with the fact that they expect you to know the ins and out of being a teacher with NO proper training. Umm behavior management ? Classroom management ? Never heard of either of them...I didn't even know how to use the printer (had to find out on my own that you're given a unique code on UniFlow/Print) People saw me struggling and no one offered to help. The staff are questionable, at least at my school...its bullies, and middle aged individuals who are geuninely angry at the world, and probably have some type of mental health issue because there is no way, you should be YELLING at children (like their youre kids) at 7:45am. Let me also mention not only are you a teacher.. be prepared to be a babysitter as well..yup, you are with those kids from 7:45am till 3:45pm...insane..no hall monitor, no lunch lady..no lunch for the staff either... youre given a ""prep"" which is a fancy word for them to say you are not eating you will be working throughout the 9 hours you are in this school. I wish i was making this up and that this wasn't my experience. I went into this opportunity so excited and happy and have left feeling so drained, annoyed, and concerned for the mental and emotional safety of these kids...also to add on...kids have to use the restroom with the door open...WEIRD Long hours, no real break time, you end up doing things you NEVER would have thought of. Your performance is also based on a scale which doesn't fully encompass your true performance. The work environment is toxic. A lot of cliques, the staff will talk behind your back, and get you in trouble if they don’t like you. Leadership it’s always in meetings, so they don’t have time to train the new teachers. The school is always understaffed, so they will throw new teachers with no experience, and expect them how to swim, although they lie and tell the new hires that there is support. You’re expected to be at the school by 7:20 am, and to stay even longer for meetings. There is no life-balance. The starting pay of 50K is low, which comes down to 750 per week, after taxes. The students are treated like inmates. Talked down, and disrespected. The expectations set for teachers, and students are unattainable. And if you bring it up to management, they will hold it against you, saying “you’re not meeting the expectations”. They say they’re “inclusive”, but I only saw black people getting hired. I was treated differently for being a different kind of minority, and not fitting their “clique”. This place will ruin your mental health, and destroy every glimpse of hope. If you need a job, take it, but as soon as you can, leave. Teachers are required to do everything and anything including making moral decisions. I enjoyed working at Success, but under the new administration no one seemed to care about the children anymore. We were flooded with ideas of the moonshot at the start of this year, a verbose way of saying we will teach/speak to children in a normal way, but we deviated hard during testing season and never returned. Children/staff were burnt out at the end of the year. This is a decent place to start working, but be mindful of long hours/additional duties. -Also network is so disconnected it’s ludicrous. They made seasoned teachers who have taught the regents for more years than they’ve been out of college listen to tips on how to get students to pass the regents. Felt bad for my colleagues who were forced to listen to multiple hour long conversations about how their kids were failing when they had a 90+% pass rate. -Pay is lowest in NYC for teaching!! Learning SA style. SA has a lot of idiosyncratic terminology, practices, and work habits. It can take new employees a long time to learn how to communicate and be fully productive. Top down decision making. Most decisions are made by a few people at the top of the organization. Chronically understaffed. Leaders unable to teach teachers to teach because they're severely overworked and understaffed themselves. Change is great, but SA changes too much, too frequently. So much change is disorienting and sometimes feels like a slap in the face. Even though you're told you'll get training and an assistant, you won't due to being continually understaffed. Even if you're completely inexperienced and need training, you will be blamed for being a failure if you don't learn quickly enough. Impossible to avoid working at home. Impossible. 60+ hour work weeks, including weekends. Work/life balance is challenging. If you are with the wrong leadership team your life is not great. Characterized by instability—abysmal retention due to network structure and subsequent psychologically unsafe workplace/educational environments Eva Moskowitz functions as if she is big brother, an endowed creator, and her influence is brutally, punitively clear from the top all the way down the network, negatively harming and creating fundamentally psychologically unstable and unsafe environments for employees of all levels, students, and their families. While SA has everything in its power to, as an organization, assume the responsibility of authentic, internal reflection, criticism, and improvement in order to provide a semblance of the services promised, legally/educationally mandated, and that those children deserve. Surface-level but effectively meaningless, disciplinarian, and repressive ideologies dominate the educational and psychological experiences of SA’s teachers, scholars, and communities alike, both implicitly and explicitly perpetuating the racist, white supremacist/savior and socioeconomic systems, (as well as problematic, neurotypical, and limiting educational paradigms) it purports to combat, with—frankly—senseless, and enormously detrimental consequences. I think SA may be at a breaking point to be honest--ten years ago it wasn't very difficult to find the type of employee described above, but it's considerably harder now that Gen Z has entered the work force & is much less willing to sacrifice their entire lives for what is now pretty pathetic pay in comparison to other, cushier industries (or even when compared to other charters). The CEO is beginning to pay lip service to employee and student retention, but only because (and I cannot stress this enough) they CANNOT keep the place staffed and at capacity in terms of students, but are still continuing to expand (make it make sense?). Excessive employee turnover is baked into the DNA of this place--so while you'll meet some great people, you're generally not going to have a high level of experience around the table, which is really challenging when you're learning how to do your job from scratch (which, because they'll hire anyone with a pulse, will most likely be the case for you). If you're considering a job here, my advice would be--if you think you can tough it out, use it as a resume builder or (if you're a teacher) to get your free degree, then exit this sinking ship as soon as you can.Challenging role that involves both coaching and teaching.

Even if you're completely inexperienced and need training, you will be blamed for being a failure if you don't learn quickly enough. Impossible to avoid working at home. Impossible. 60+ hour work weeks, including weekends. Work/life balance is challenging. If you are with the wrong leadership team your life is not great. Characterized by instability—abysmal retention due to network structure and subsequent psychologically unsafe workplace/educational environments Eva Moskowitz functions as if she is big brother, an endowed creator, and her influence is brutally, punitively clear from the top all the way down the network, negatively harming and creating fundamentally psychologically unstable and unsafe environments for employees of all levels, students, and their families. While SA has everything in its power to, as an organization, assume the responsibility of authentic, internal reflection, criticism, and improvement in order to provide a semblance of the services promised, legally/educationally mandated, and that those children deserve. Surface-level but effectively meaningless, disciplinarian, and repressive ideologies dominate the educational and psychological experiences of SA’s teachers, scholars, and communities alike, both implicitly and explicitly perpetuating the racist, white supremacist/savior and socioeconomic systems, (as well as problematic, neurotypical, and limiting educational paradigms) it purports to combat, with—frankly—senseless, and enormously detrimental consequences. I think SA may be at a breaking point to be honest--ten years ago it wasn't very difficult to find the type of employee described above, but it's considerably harder now that Gen Z has entered the work force & is much less willing to sacrifice their entire lives for what is now pretty pathetic pay in comparison to other, cushier industries (or even when compared to other charters). The CEO is beginning to pay lip service to employee and student retention, but only because (and I cannot stress this enough) they CANNOT keep the place staffed and at capacity in terms of students, but are still continuing to expand (make it make sense?). Excessive employee turnover is baked into the DNA of this place--so while you'll meet some great people, you're generally not going to have a high level of experience around the table, which is really challenging when you're learning how to do your job from scratch (which, because they'll hire anyone with a pulse, will most likely be the case for you). If you're considering a job here, my advice would be--if you think you can tough it out, use it as a resume builder or (if you're a teacher) to get your free degree, then exit this sinking ship as soon as you can.Challenging role that involves both coaching and teaching. This school is concerning to say the least. Lets start off with the fact that they expect you to know the ins and out of being a teacher with NO proper training. Umm behavior management ? Classroom management ? Never heard of either of them...I didn't even know how to use the printer (had to find out on my own that you're given a unique code on UniFlow/Print) People saw me struggling and no one offered to help. The staff are questionable, at least at my school...its bullies, and middle aged individuals who are geuninely angry at the world, and probably have some type of mental health issue because there is no way, you should be YELLING at children (like their youre kids) at 7:45am. Let me also mention not only are you a teacher.. be prepared to be a babysitter as well..yup, you are with those kids from 7:45am till 3:45pm...insane..no hall monitor, no lunch lady..no lunch for the staff either... youre given a ""prep"" which is a fancy word for them to say you are not eating you will be working throughout the 9 hours you are in this school. I wish i was making this up and that this wasn't my experience. I went into this opportunity so excited and happy and have left feeling so drained, annoyed, and concerned for the mental and emotional safety of these kids...also to add on...kids have to use the restroom with the door open...WEIRD The work environment is toxic. A lot of cliques, the staff will talk behind your back, and get you in trouble if they don’t like you. Leadership it’s always in meetings, so they don’t have time to train the new teachers. The school is always understaffed, so they will throw new teachers with no experience, and expect them how to swim, although they lie and tell the new hires that there is support. You’re expected to be at the school by 7:20 am, and to stay even longer for meetings. There is no life-balance. The starting pay of 50K is low, which comes down to 750 per week, after taxes. The students are treated like inmates. Talked down, and disrespected. The expectations set for teachers, and students are unattainable. And if you bring it up to management, they will hold it against you, saying “you’re not meeting the expectations”. They say they’re “inclusive”, but I only saw black people getting hired. I was treated differently for being a different kind of minority, and not fitting their “clique”. This place will ruin your mental health, and destroy every glimpse of hope. If you need a job, take it, but as soon as you can, leave. Long hours, no real break time, you end up doing things you NEVER would have thought of. Your performance is also based on a scale which doesn't fully encompass your true performance. Teachers are required to do everything and anything including making moral decisions. I enjoyed working at Success, but under the new administration no one seemed to care about the children anymore. We were flooded with ideas of the moonshot at the start of this year, a verbose way of saying we will teach/speak to children in a normal way, but we deviated hard during testing season and never returned. Children/staff were burnt out at the end of the year. This is a decent place to start working, but be mindful of long hours/additional duties. -Also network is so disconnected it’s ludicrous. They made seasoned teachers who have taught the regents for more years than they’ve been out of college listen to tips on how to get students to pass the regents. Felt bad for my colleagues who were forced to listen to multiple hour long conversations about how their kids were failing when they had a 90+% pass rate. -Pay is lowest in NYC for teaching!!

Learning SA style. SA has a lot of idiosyncratic terminology, practices, and work habits. It can take new employees a long time to learn how to communicate and be fully productive. Top down decision making. Most decisions are made by a few people at the top of the organization. They violate federal and state laws on a daily basis regarding children with special needs. Teachers are uncertified and do not have the training required to effectively teach all learners. Systematic humiliation of children. Administrators don’t know how to manage children so they call 911 on five-year-olds. If you search “Success Academy lawsuit” and “Success Academy 911” you can learn more. Extremely low teacher retention. Network office does not care about retaining talent, and is happy to see teachers with 6+ years of experience walk. Network office also promised bonuses for teachers who achieved high academic outcomes, but at the end of the year, did not give bonuses to teachers who had hit the mark because ""too many people"" rose to the occasion. When asked politely about said bonus, the Network office threatened to fire teachers or take away their summer pay. The Success Academy network is full of bullies taking home fat pay checks, while many of the schools face extreme budget cuts, lack of resources, and fed up staff. Because of high employee turn over, every school is packed with ""teachers"" with zero experience, and student outcomes are suffering.Challenging role that involves both coaching and teaching. - Constant gaslighting: you simultaneously need to set high goals that are nearly impossible to hit, only to then be regularly questioned why you're not hitting your goals. You are told you're doing a great job week to week, but at review time you're told that you're not nearly good enough for that raise or promotion (if you even get to have that conversation), questioned why you don't know something even if you've never discussed it before. - CEO and management prioritize their friends and people who have been there forever. If you're new, consider yourself the lowest of the low. No one will listen to you or care about you unless you're a ""yes man."" Don't bother advocating for yourself, they'll use your vulnerability against you. - The job description you apply to might not match the job you get assigned on your first day. - Revolving door of talent: you will always have to pick up other people's slack because no one can manage to stay at SA for very long.

Leaders unable to teach teachers to teach because they're severely overworked and understaffed themselves. Change is great, but SA changes too much, too frequently. So much change is disorienting and sometimes feels like a slap in the face. Even though you're told you'll get training and an assistant, you won't due to being continually understaffed. Even if you're completely inexperienced and need training, you will be blamed for being a failure if you don't learn quickly enough. Impossible to avoid working at home. Impossible. 60+ hour work weeks, including weekends. Work/life balance is challenging. If you are with the wrong leadership team your life is not great. Characterized by instability—abysmal retention due to network structure and subsequent psychologically unsafe workplace/educational environments Eva Moskowitz functions as if she is big brother, an endowed creator, and her influence is brutally, punitively clear from the top all the way down the network, negatively harming and creating fundamentally psychologically unstable and unsafe environments for employees of all levels, students, and their families. While SA has everything in its power to, as an organization, assume the responsibility of authentic, internal reflection, criticism, and improvement in order to provide a semblance of the services promised, legally/educationally mandated, and that those children deserve. Surface-level but effectively meaningless, disciplinarian, and repressive ideologies dominate the educational and psychological experiences of SA’s teachers, scholars, and communities alike, both implicitly and explicitly perpetuating the racist, white supremacist/savior and socioeconomic systems, (as well as problematic, neurotypical, and limiting educational paradigms) it purports to combat, with—frankly—senseless, and enormously detrimental consequences. I think SA may be at a breaking point to be honest--ten years ago it wasn't very difficult to find the type of employee described above, but it's considerably harder now that Gen Z has entered the work force & is much less willing to sacrifice their entire lives for what is now pretty pathetic pay in comparison to other, cushier industries (or even when compared to other charters). The CEO is beginning to pay lip service to employee and student retention, but only because (and I cannot stress this enough) they CANNOT keep the place staffed and at capacity in terms of students, but are still continuing to expand (make it make sense?). Excessive employee turnover is baked into the DNA of this place--so while you'll meet some great people, you're generally not going to have a high level of experience around the table, which is really challenging when you're learning how to do your job from scratch (which, because they'll hire anyone with a pulse, will most likely be the case for you). If you're considering a job here, my advice would be--if you think you can tough it out, use it as a resume builder or (if you're a teacher) to get your free degree, then exit this sinking ship as soon as you can.Challenging role that involves both coaching and teaching. This school is concerning to say the least. Lets start off with the fact that they expect you to know the ins and out of being a teacher with NO proper training. Umm behavior management ? Classroom management ? Never heard of either of them...I didn't even know how to use the printer (had to find out on my own that you're given a unique code on UniFlow/Print) People saw me struggling and no one offered to help. The staff are questionable, at least at my school...its bullies, and middle aged individuals who are geuninely angry at the world, and probably have some type of mental health issue because there is no way, you should be YELLING at children (like their youre kids) at 7:45am. Let me also mention not only are you a teacher.. be prepared to be a babysitter as well..yup, you are with those kids from 7:45am till 3:45pm...insane..no hall monitor, no lunch lady..no lunch for the staff either... youre given a ""prep"" which is a fancy word for them to say you are not eating you will be working throughout the 9 hours you are in this school. I wish i was making this up and that this wasn't my experience. I went into this opportunity so excited and happy and have left feeling so drained, annoyed, and concerned for the mental and emotional safety of these kids...also to add on...kids have to use the restroom with the door open...WEIRD The work environment is toxic. A lot of cliques, the staff will talk behind your back, and get you in trouble if they don’t like you. Leadership it’s always in meetings, so they don’t have time to train the new teachers. The school is always understaffed, so they will throw new teachers with no experience, and expect them how to swim, although they lie and tell the new hires that there is support. You’re expected to be at the school by 7:20 am, and to stay even longer for meetings. There is no life-balance. The starting pay of 50K is low, which comes down to 750 per week, after taxes. The students are treated like inmates. Talked down, and disrespected. The expectations set for teachers, and students are unattainable. And if you bring it up to management, they will hold it against you, saying “you’re not meeting the expectations”. They say they’re “inclusive”, but I only saw black people getting hired. I was treated differently for being a different kind of minority, and not fitting their “clique”. This place will ruin your mental health, and destroy every glimpse of hope. If you need a job, take it, but as soon as you can, leave. Long hours, no real break time, you end up doing things you NEVER would have thought of. Your performance is also based on a scale which doesn't fully encompass your true performance. Teachers are required to do everything and anything including making moral decisions. I enjoyed working at Success, but under the new administration no one seemed to care about the children anymore. We were flooded with ideas of the moonshot at the start of this year, a verbose way of saying we will teach/speak to children in a normal way, but we deviated hard during testing season and never returned. Children/staff were burnt out at the end of the year. This is a decent place to start working, but be mindful of long hours/additional duties. -Also network is so disconnected it’s ludicrous. They made seasoned teachers who have taught the regents for more years than they’ve been out of college listen to tips on how to get students to pass the regents. Felt bad for my colleagues who were forced to listen to multiple hour long conversations about how their kids were failing when they had a 90+% pass rate. -Pay is lowest in NYC for teaching!!

Learning SA style. SA has a lot of idiosyncratic terminology, practices, and work habits. It can take new employees a long time to learn how to communicate and be fully productive. Top down decision making. Most decisions are made by a few people at the top of the organization. They violate federal and state laws on a daily basis regarding children with special needs. Teachers are uncertified and do not have the training required to effectively teach all learners. Systematic humiliation of children. Administrators don’t know how to manage children so they call 911 on five-year-olds. If you search “Success Academy lawsuit” and “Success Academy 911” you can learn more. Extremely low teacher retention. Network office does not care about retaining talent, and is happy to see teachers with 6+ years of experience walk. Network office also promised bonuses for teachers who achieved high academic outcomes, but at the end of the year, did not give bonuses to teachers who had hit the mark because ""too many people"" rose to the occasion. When asked politely about said bonus, the Network office threatened to fire teachers or take away their summer pay. The Success Academy network is full of bullies taking home fat pay checks, while many of the schools face extreme budget cuts, lack of resources, and fed up staff. Because of high employee turn over, every school is packed with ""teachers"" with zero experience, and student outcomes are suffering.Challenging role that involves both coaching and teaching.
