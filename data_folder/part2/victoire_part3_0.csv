Heavy workload & complicated process for approvals. Salary increases are minimal (0% - 2%) so if you're a new engineer the only way to get up to market rate with increased experience is to leave the company (i got a 37% raise when I left for a job with fewer responsibilities). Poor work live balance. There is a minimum expectation is 9 hours a day and is fairly common to be asked to work on weekends.

So they always think you are paid to much. Some of the downsides of working at Stellantis are the long hours, the repetitive noise, and the separation of benefits between part time and full time workers. Lower salary. Difficult to move around in company. The merger between FCA and PSA has created an incredible disruption. Sr leadership is pushing to get an enormous number of new programs quickly out the door with no consideration (cluelessness) for the technical challenges that they present. Employees are squeezed like lemons, programs are behind and all is done is to make money available to subcontract to engineering services companies which results in little to no decrease on workload (engineering services still need to be trained and coordinated), loss of knowhow and overall dissatisfaction of the employees. The company has no directions from higher ups in harmonizing and converge processes, all the work is done bottom up with considerable effort and in silos, since different organization are not proceeding in alignment and political games are inducing procrastination and slow downs.

The ability to loft 50 lbs is not a joke. The average bag of feed weighs about 50 lbs and daily you have to help load customers purchases when yhet need help. And this usually is always the bags of feed. It's a great job for getting and staying in shape but not for the weak by any means. The pay can be a major con The managers in 0564 are unreliable and have unrealistic expectations. They can’t keep employees because the upper management does nothing when issues are brought up. You start to bring up an issue and when you begin to document everything and then you’re all of a sudden and awful person for holding people accountable. Don’t expect accountability. Also, there is a general lack of respect within that building. There are also a lot of very DIRTY uppers in that store and in the district. So watch your mouth and be carful when approaching a problem. Honestly I would recommend just documenting stuff for a month or so and then just send it to HR. Let them handle the rest. Where do I start? Pay is so low the turnover at my store in Michigan was over 60%. Not enough people working daily to give ""legendary customer service."" Too much heavy lifting, you won’t need a gym membership. Animal feed, dog food, salt blocks and more are 50 lbs or more. It's not uncommon for customers to ask/need 10 to 20 hand loaded into their vehicles. You will have no help doing so. District Managers are a joke, if you get a good one, be very happy. There is not a plan in place for moving up the ranks, just outlast your coworkers. New hires are giving more pay than seasoned workers. Women should be prepared to be looked upon as a ""brainless"" by most male customers for all areas other than in the clothing department. Did I mention that the pay is horrible. As a summer job okay, but if you are looking for a career, keep looking. Don't work here. Within 3 months company changed their fertility benefits policy TWICE. They used to offer two IVF cycles after 30 days of employment. First they changed it to a year of employment in late May, now they cut it back to just 1 IVF cycle with just a 30 day notice. So HEARTLESS. those people have no idea what it’s like going through infertility, and that in most cases 1 cycle is not enough to become pregnant. They’re about to face thousands of people quitting cause that’s not the way to treat your employees who work tirelessly in order to get a chance to grow their families. Company likes to talk about their great values, but when it’s time to demonstrate it in action - turns out their values are only words and it doesn’t go beyond that. SHAME Don't expect to get any raises. Can't get out of cycle raises and being told only a limited amount of people get raises at review time. We also got told when prices go up on products, we can get a raise. Again, goes back to the first couple lines. Don't expect a straight answer from anyone above the store manager. We get a canned statement of why they do things. Don't expect any so called management come to your store other than district manager. Not sure about other stores, but can get behind on things due to budget restraints and not having extra body to help out. At the end of my employment, I lost a lot of faith in the way this store was being run and by who it was ran by, the current manager was not the best and the replacement assistant manager was not helpful and was only there to stroke the ego of the manager who ruled everyone with an iron fist after I left. Poor pay. Took the job for the benefits. Paid for the insurance for a year, now they’ve cut the benefits and I can’t use what I’ve been paying into/working there for. Huge disappointment Disconnect between field team supervisor, store managers and district managers. Often I was told different things by each person, which made it difficult to keep up with what was supposed to be done, despite all of us given the same information through weekly conference calls. Management lacks communication skills with it's employees, constantly changing schedules so you can't stick to personal plans.

Poor pay. Took the job for the benefits. Paid for the insurance for a year, now they’ve cut the benefits and I can’t use what I’ve been paying into/working there for. Huge disappointment Disconnect between field team supervisor, store managers and district managers. Often I was told different things by each person, which made it difficult to keep up with what was supposed to be done, despite all of us given the same information through weekly conference calls. Management lacks communication skills with it's employees, constantly changing schedules so you can't stick to personal plans. Took 1.5 weeks to get a response email after the initial interview when they said it would come in the next day or two. Afterwards they were under prepared and had to postpone the actual day I started twice.It can be a very physically demanding. The ability to loft 50 lbs is not a joke. The average bag of feed weighs about 50 lbs and daily you have to help load customers purchases when yhet need help. And this usually is always the bags of feed. It's a great job for getting and staying in shape but not for the weak by any means. The pay can be a major con The managers in 0564 are unreliable and have unrealistic expectations. They can’t keep employees because the upper management does nothing when issues are brought up. You start to bring up an issue and when you begin to document everything and then you’re all of a sudden and awful person for holding people accountable. Don’t expect accountability. Also, there is a general lack of respect within that building. There are also a lot of very DIRTY uppers in that store and in the district. So watch your mouth and be carful when approaching a problem. Honestly I would recommend just documenting stuff for a month or so and then just send it to HR. Let them handle the rest. Where do I start? Pay is so low the turnover at my store in Michigan was over 60%. Not enough people working daily to give ""legendary customer service."" Too much heavy lifting, you won’t need a gym membership. Animal feed, dog food, salt blocks and more are 50 lbs or more. It's not uncommon for customers to ask/need 10 to 20 hand loaded into their vehicles. You will have no help doing so. District Managers are a joke, if you get a good one, be very happy. There is not a plan in place for moving up the ranks, just outlast your coworkers. New hires are giving more pay than seasoned workers. Women should be prepared to be looked upon as a ""brainless"" by most male customers for all areas other than in the clothing department. Did I mention that the pay is horrible. As a summer job okay, but if you are looking for a career, keep looking. Don't work here. Within 3 months company changed their fertility benefits policy TWICE. They used to offer two IVF cycles after 30 days of employment. First they changed it to a year of employment in late May, now they cut it back to just 1 IVF cycle with just a 30 day notice. So HEARTLESS. those people have no idea what it’s like going through infertility, and that in most cases 1 cycle is not enough to become pregnant. They’re about to face thousands of people quitting cause that’s not the way to treat your employees who work tirelessly in order to get a chance to grow their families. Company likes to talk about their great values, but when it’s time to demonstrate it in action - turns out their values are only words and it doesn’t go beyond that. SHAME Don't expect to get any raises. Can't get out of cycle raises and being told only a limited amount of people get raises at review time. We also got told when prices go up on products, we can get a raise. Again, goes back to the first couple lines. Don't expect a straight answer from anyone above the store manager.

The lack of competence, the unprofessionalism, the gossip, lack of responsibility, etc is so profound that I’m surprised this company is even running smoothly. What happens is that project managers/architects make unnecessary over promises to their clients (the government for instance) , at the expense of employees mental health and well being. So it’s common for employees to take on extremely complex projects that are out of the scope of their skill set, not to mention these projects tend to be so demanding that it’s common place for some to consistently work overtime, without pay. I for one had to work till 10pm everyday over a stretch of 2 months, not getting paid overtime. But none of that matters, because leadership made promises to the government without consulting their employees. Also, it’s common for you to get thrown under the bus by your own leadership. There are certain responsibilities that are designated to management, but for some reason they like to relegate these tasks to their employees, and then when things take a turn for the worse, we have to take the blame The pay is well below market rate for a given profession even though ICF claims to regularly benchmark salaries. You get such little PTO that if you take a couple days off every few months or get sick, you burn through it. People are underpaid, overworked, and get no real breaks, so most people leave within a couple years Health insurance is expensive and not that great. The work environment can get toxic and there's nothing you can really do about it. Gaslighting and passive aggressive communication is normal. Unclear and changing expectations are a given. The work gets boring and repetitive. Projects can go on for years, and you can get stuck working on them that long, which deprives you of the satisfaction of achieving regular milestones. Maybe it depends on your manager, but in my experience the only way to get new, interesting, or different work is to make your own connections (hard to do when you're stuck working on the same projects with the same people for years) and offer your help. Project management is an issue from the top down. Senior leadership pushes to get more work, teams are understaffed, and many project managers are seriously lacking in project and client management skills. If you gently suggest trying something new or different in regard to project or client management, bad project managers take it personally and get defensive. But if you're not coming up with ideas to improve the team you're not taking enough initiative. This is really a place to bide your time and try to get a decent title until you can find a better job at a better company. Management did not care about me at all I was flattered to be recruited by ICF, a company that I had admired from afar for a few years. The interview process was smooth, professional, and inspired much hope for what was to come. That is where the positive experiences stopped. I ended up being bait and switched, finding out that I had a new manager on day one (they had not been a part of any of my interviews). This had not been communicated to me by anyone and it was clear that I was not a welcome direct report to this person. Additionally, I was supposed to have 3-4 direct reports and never was given any, despite multiple promises and discussions over the course of months. Basically, everything that was promised to me during the interview process did not come to fruition. After the first week, I was given very little direction or guidance from my manager, often being left to scramble for something to do to remain ""billable."" This manager was very inaccessible to me, often leaving me on read for days at a time, while responding to other emails or group chats in the meantime. This person showed no interest in my professional development/goals or well being. Unfortunately, this was not an individual issue. The team culture of my line of business was incredibly toxic and cliquey. I found myself being bullied by senior managers and publicly shamed/made an example of on emails without cause. One senior manager berated me on a 1:1 call almost to the point of me being in tears for being late to an in-person meeting (due to forces out of my control) that I was coerced to attend, despite being hired as a remote employee. I spent many months trying to get plugged into projects and contribute my expertise but nearly all attempts were ignored/shut down and I was systematically kicked off program teams without notice or reason. In one instance my manager told me that the client didn't like me and when I asked them to share why or if there was any feedback, they said they just had a ""hunch."" Incredibly unprofessional! Along with that, internal communications were highly unprofessional where management would talk badly about clients and discuss topics such as our client rep's salary, among other highly inappropriate things. On some client calls, my manager interrupted and talked over the client to the point of making everyone in the meeting uncomfortable. My manager stranded me without work and I was forced to seek assignments from other managers outside of my division. Much of the work I ended up doing did not fall in line with the title that I was hired for (some even made me feel like I was a glorified intern). Furthermore, I was made aware that other people on the team gossiped and spread rumors about me, even while we were in-person at the office. When one of my colleagues dared to stand up for me in the midst of the bullying, they were retaliated against and blocked from the project group. Overall, I made a few attempts to get support within the company but was repeatedly treated like the enemy and like I had nowhere to turn. I spent nearly every day at ICF feeling deeply unvalued, mistreated, psychologically unsafe, and in fear that I would lose my job. I will never recommend this company to anyone I know. Poor compensation and leadership needs to work on their relationship with their staff members I have never encountered a more incompetent, catty or cliquey group than what I experienced in their Talent Acquisition organization. They prioritize metrics over results, meetings over productivity, and don't expect your manager to stick up for you. managing unrealistic expectations of work done Pay raises could be a little bit higher, but can’t think of any other ones. Depending on the team work management overload.None, I would fully recommend Not a lot of focus on employee growth At times I wonder how the leadership was even selected at this place.

In one instance my manager told me that the client didn't like me and when I asked them to share why or if there was any feedback, they said they just had a ""hunch."" Incredibly unprofessional! Along with that, internal communications were highly unprofessional where management would talk badly about clients and discuss topics such as our client rep's salary, among other highly inappropriate things. On some client calls, my manager interrupted and talked over the client to the point of making everyone in the meeting uncomfortable. My manager stranded me without work and I was forced to seek assignments from other managers outside of my division. Much of the work I ended up doing did not fall in line with the title that I was hired for (some even made me feel like I was a glorified intern). Furthermore, I was made aware that other people on the team gossiped and spread rumors about me, even while we were in-person at the office. When one of my colleagues dared to stand up for me in the midst of the bullying, they were retaliated against and blocked from the project group. Overall, I made a few attempts to get support within the company but was repeatedly treated like the enemy and like I had nowhere to turn. I spent nearly every day at ICF feeling deeply unvalued, mistreated, psychologically unsafe, and in fear that I would lose my job. I will never recommend this company to anyone I know. Poor compensation and leadership needs to work on their relationship with their staff members I have never encountered a more incompetent, catty or cliquey group than what I experienced in their Talent Acquisition organization. They prioritize metrics over results, meetings over productivity, and don't expect your manager to stick up for you. managing unrealistic expectations of work done Pay raises could be a little bit higher, but can’t think of any other ones.None, I would fully recommend At times I wonder how the leadership was even selected at this place. The lack of competence, the unprofessionalism, the gossip, lack of responsibility, etc is so profound that I’m surprised this company is even running smoothly. What happens is that project managers/architects make unnecessary over promises to their clients (the government for instance) , at the expense of employees mental health and well being. So it’s common for employees to take on extremely complex projects that are out of the scope of their skill set, not to mention these projects tend to be so demanding that it’s common place for some to consistently work overtime, without pay. I for one had to work till 10pm everyday over a stretch of 2 months, not getting paid overtime. But none of that matters, because leadership made promises to the government without consulting their employees. Also, it’s common for you to get thrown under the bus by your own leadership. There are certain responsibilities that are designated to management, but for some reason they like to relegate these tasks to their employees, and then when things take a turn for the worse, we have to take the blame The pay is well below market rate for a given profession even though ICF claims to regularly benchmark salaries. You get such little PTO that if you take a couple days off every few months or get sick, you burn through it. People are underpaid, overworked, and get no real breaks, so most people leave within a couple years Health insurance is expensive and not that great. The work environment can get toxic and there's nothing you can really do about it. Gaslighting and passive aggressive communication is normal. Unclear and changing expectations are a given. The work gets boring and repetitive. Projects can go on for years, and you can get stuck working on them that long, which deprives you of the satisfaction of achieving regular milestones. Maybe it depends on your manager, but in my experience the only way to get new, interesting, or different work is to make your own connections (hard to do when you're stuck working on the same projects with the same people for years) and offer your help. Project management is an issue from the top down. Senior leadership pushes to get more work, teams are understaffed, and many project managers are seriously lacking in project and client management skills. If you gently suggest trying something new or different in regard to project or client management, bad project managers take it personally and get defensive. But if you're not coming up with ideas to improve the team you're not taking enough initiative. This is really a place to bide your time and try to get a decent title until you can find a better job at a better company.

The building is small so everyone knows each other. There’s Diversity, which is a good thing. Good people work at this location. Great work environment for me Great experience working with very critically ill patients. Easy to request time off. Benefits, time off, culture, cohesion -good coworkers -not much else","health insurance choice is limit There are no cons here They underpay immensely to begin with and they have cut down even more in the last year. The HIM Tech position is a manger position but they eliminated the title in order to underpay. You are running the entire department but not getting the pay or title for it. They actually got rid of a lot of the managerial positions so the opportunity for growth is slim, this also meant there was recent demotions/lay offs to a lot of people. Some been here 20+ years. Money is the only concern to Kindreds CEOs. Instead of investing in its employees they treat everyone as replaceable and not worth the time. If moneys the goal that seems to contradict itself but they seem to think they know better than anyone and they’ll treat you that way too. It’s a very top down management process so anyone below the CEOs aren’t included in any department changes but the CEOs have no clue what any department actually does. There’s no respect or communication, they make changes and just tell you at random so there’s never any time to prepare for change. New Administration is not good, have absolutely no value for long time employees. They do not value or support Diversity. Administration is rude and unprofessional. The salary can be better for this region. Low pay especially in todays world No cons during my time. Kindred rewards the ones with bad behavior by hiring them back, again and again. There is zero accountability. The toxic culture will never change because it starts from the top. Lack of information coming down from a corporate level, training -minimal 401k matching, long wait until full vesting (5 yrs) -CEO more concerned about the census number, then quality of care -with the COVID drop in census, eliminated an RD position despite census bouncing back eventually, minimal notice given (<2 weeks)"

Almost nothing more than restocking shelves and cleaning floors. -flexible schedule and nice coworkers","time management schedule issue conflict Giant Eagle will employ anyone who walks into the door. We run out of basic supplies such as plastic bags, spray bottles and such way too easily. It is very draining, repetitive and boring work. Customers are unbelievably rude and management is often clueless. Management is often snippy and rude when asked simple questions. I don't even bother talking to some managers for that reason. POS system has way too many bugs to count. Something always goes wrong with it. Some workers are prone to the ""I don't care"" mindset. It is very frustrating when they ignore legitimate issues such as mistreatment of others. -Low pay. Better than fast food work but not by much. -Some days extremely busy, some completely dead -Takes forever for corporate to address any staff concerns, if at all Unnamed ""stakeholders"" outside of anyone I directly worked with controlled our deadlines and projects, which were often too short and constantly changing without notice. People were laid off seemingly at random despite constant reassurances from my manager that though it was out of their control, we were valued and it wouldn't happen again. Strict dress code strict attendance policy corporate policies and bargaining agreements interfere with everyday work that would otherwise be simple. It is retail, weekends, holiday don't count on them. Long hours as salary. Unfortunately the managers are unbearably atrocious. The lower level manager, who's on the floor with all the workers, only ever offers criticism for jobs--even those that are very well done--never offers praise, and rarely knows the answers to even the simplest questions.

Good money 3 shifts flexible Pay & benfits vacation bonus Great culture great environment Good work life balance","The company has a poor image and sometimes led to some customers saying some nasty things, after accepting extra hours sometimes it can feel a little forced Nothing negative to say about company Low hourly wages. Tax credits taken by company that result in unrealistic estimated tips earned by serving staff results in staff being taxed for tip income not earned. Additionally, company program to ensure a minimum hourly rate of $11.50 per hour uses a formula which assumes the employee makes 22% of shift sales in tips is inaccurate and defeats the purpose of the program for servers at locations that receive much lower tip income than 22% of shift sales. Guaranteed legal minimum wage should be paid regardless of tip income earned. It is unfair and in my opinion unethical for the company to use cash tip earnings as part of their calculation of hourly base rate pay for servers. A tip is a gift from the customer to the server. It is not wages paid by the company for work performed. Working Holidays. Sometimes you would like to not work but its not too bad Poor quality of guest you have to deal with a very unsavory crowd of folks if you are on particular shifts. All employees are not held to the same standards... I have worked all shifts and 1st shift is hectic so they get away with murder and leave without doing side work so when I come in on 2nd shift I have to finish their work then 3rd shift is lazy so they don't come in on time and then want everything pristine for them to start their shift. So I get screwed by both and I work the cook and me as the only server! I have worked the entire store by myself for several hours cooking and serving me alone with not one ioda of give a damn. But I kept my customers happy and the store was clean and stocked but I come in to a complete mess with a store full of employees! Employees calling out. Hard to keep night shift people. Low pay if you're doing a shift as a server. Lots of drunk people at night and large families in the morning, it can get packed so easily and sometimes you'd have to run a packed restaurant with only 2 people in the building and this has gone wrong many times if a new person is scheduled. ALSO i had to train people most of the time which isn't really a problem except this one time i had to train a man (for a management position) making 3x more than me where he refused to learn anything so i had to cook, serve and clean the entire restaurant which was actually the worst management experience i had there (which is a plus) Managers need to take real life situations seriously. It can be tough to learn but once you learn it you won’t unlearn it lolThe company has a poor image and sometimes led to some customers saying some nasty things, after accepting extra hours sometimes it can feel a little forced Nothing negative to say about company Low hourly wages.

I have worked all shifts and 1st shift is hectic so they get away with murder and leave without doing side work so when I come in on 2nd shift I have to finish their work then 3rd shift is lazy so they don't come in on time and then want everything pristine for them to start their shift. So I get screwed by both and I work the cook and me as the only server! I have worked the entire store by myself for several hours cooking and serving me alone with not one ioda of give a damn. But I kept my customers happy and the store was clean and stocked but I come in to a complete mess with a store full of employees! Employees calling out. Hard to keep night shift people. Low pay if you're doing a shift as a server. Lots of drunk people at night and large families in the morning, it can get packed so easily and sometimes you'd have to run a packed restaurant with only 2 people in the building and this has gone wrong many times if a new person is scheduled. ALSO i had to train people most of the time which isn't really a problem except this one time i had to train a man (for a management position) making 3x more than me where he refused to learn anything so i had to cook, serve and clean the entire restaurant which was actually the worst management experience i had there (which is a plus) Managers need to take real life situations seriously. It can be tough to learn but once you learn it you won’t unlearn it lolThe company has a poor image and sometimes led to some customers saying some nasty things, after accepting extra hours sometimes it can feel a little forced Nothing negative to say about company Low hourly wages. Tax credits taken by company that result in unrealistic estimated tips earned by serving staff results in staff being taxed for tip income not earned. Additionally, company program to ensure a minimum hourly rate of $11.50 per hour uses a formula which assumes the employee makes 22% of shift sales in tips is inaccurate and defeats the purpose of the program for servers at locations that receive much lower tip income than 22% of shift sales. Guaranteed legal minimum wage should be paid regardless of tip income earned. It is unfair and in my opinion unethical for the company to use cash tip earnings as part of their calculation of hourly base rate pay for servers. A tip is a gift from the customer to the server. It is not wages paid by the company for work performed. Working Holidays.

On top of this, I lost my 401K company match because I was not at AB for 3 years... which was entirely out of my control. AB never made this right, never cut me a check or let me keep my match after selling me off. I was treated horribly by management from day 1 with AB. None of the upper management took accountability for anything. Every problem at the factory was the shift manager's problem. We would be berated on a daily basis for systemic problems at the factory that went unchecked for years. Every day at work was a blame game between employees and everything ultimately fell on the lowest level salary employees, shift managers. I will never want to work for AB again and will never point anyone in their direction. Salary. No Merritt increases. Difficult to get promoted. No work life balance. Manual labor Early start times Some customers suck poor management, terrible decisions, promote the wrong people, not rewarded for results, very politcal, no accountability, poor work life balance have to work OT in order to make ok money.
