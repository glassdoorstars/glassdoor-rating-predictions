Thoughtworks doesn't place a high priority on ""profiting"" as much as it focuses on ""maintaining a sustainable business"". While I find this HIGHLY admirable, it does place the company in tough spots during recessions. However they've only ever done layoffs in SUPER rare cases (maybe 3 times total in its existance) and still take care of those folks after the fact. boring projects, lots of travel - Depending on position, client site traveling has ramped back up (con if you prefer full remote/no travel) - Some people can feel lost/disoriented if they are coming from rigid-type systems (ie: some coming straight from college or laterals coming from waterfall type of organizations) - There is less focus on social/economic justice, one of the initial pillars once upon a time, ""Advocate passionately for social and economic justice"". - Pairing can get exhausting - For some getting staffed on a client can be like playing the lottery (you will hear ""it's your job to get staffed"" from upper management, but realistically you can only control what you can control and that is stay focused, work on yourself/skills) - Loss of transparency - Unfortunately, a lot of what made this place special has changed since pivoting from their initial pillars that made the company so special/different The prestige and market differentiation are gone. Most projects are now run-of-the-mill staff augmentation. Social justice is a gimmick they use to bring on competent and smart people they'd otherwise never be able to afford. Get this straight: not only will you never do anything related to social justice here, but you'll also be grossly underpaid. Lot of smart senior colleagues but they're also overworked and burned out. If you're a junior, better pray that you're lucky enough to get staffed on a project where seniors have the capacity to mentor you. Pairing is fine in cases but pairing every hour every day is tiring and becomes another reason for burning out by the time you reach senior level. If you want exposure to different tech stacks, go work at a startup where you'll wear many hats. If you want mentorship, find a product-driven company where seniors and managers aren't burned out. * Thoughtworks is a cult. You have a vague sense when you're in it. It becomes much clearer once you leave. It has all the hallmarks of a cult: adulation of its founder; widespread indoctrination that starts with TW University for graduate hires; vociferous advocacy of its ""secret sauce"", i.e. the TW way; and low tolerance for differences of opinion, particularly on the so-called ""social justice"" pillar. * About that pillar: there is a strangely dogmatic combination of neo-socialism and neo-liberalism that runs through the company, especially some in leadership positions. Any dissenting voices, even those who simply ask their political views to be left alone, are likely to be shouted down and ostracized. * Who you know and how you impress them weighs more than what you know and how you can contribute. Thoughtworks is more prone to this than the average company. The so-called flat hierarchy encourages consultants to curry favors on the grapevine. The one with the most favorable rumors is likely to get better projects and promotions. * The leadership teams seem to relish their roles as petty tyrants. If your project's Delivery Leadership Team, usually 3 people strong, has a loudmouth who dislikes you, it is very likely you'll find it hard to last on the project. What's more, you'll get obscure negative feedback like ""difficult to work with"", ""doesn't align with TW values"", etc., which is sure to dent your career aspirations. distributed staff world wide means it's ever harder to get to know one another which is a lot of the magic at ThoughtWorks - much effort goes into to crafting our distributed teams & giving us all the opportunity to work together * Pay increases as compared to market * No bonuses - poor career growth paths - poor transparency (even though they pride themselves on transparency its a trap/allusion. They will tell one person one thing and another person another and then a week later announce something totally different to the company) Clueless management, detached from what PS needs - The economy is forcing some changes due to limited work being able for US based consultants. - The layoff earlier this year has people a bit on edge, especially given the rest of the economy.I honestly can't think of any....maybe the company can work on improving sales?

Tried to write her up after first offense and district manager Pam wouldn’t allow it. After second occurrence she still just wanted me to “talk to her about it.” I asked Pam what if it was a slur about black people instead and she said that the employee would be immediately terminated. Said DM also had terrible grammar and punctuation in her written communication and wanted us to open stores when the government told us specifically to stay off roads. When asked what if someone gets in an accident, will the company cover costs of damage and injuries, she responded with, no that’s just life. Complete disregard for human life. The cons of working at Carter's: 1) HR is extremely involved in the decisions of every department, if you don't work in the actual function you shouldn't decide what is best for that department; 2) Not great for minorities as there isn't much room for promotion (look at the tone at top, you don't see many minorities up there); 3) In relation to promotions, when there is an opportunity to promote employees within and the employee is more than qualified they are skipped over especially when they are a minority; 4) Vacation policy is horrible! You only get a certain amount of days and you don't get anymore days for 10 years! 5) The company has no idea what it wants to do with remote work 6) Some people micromanage too much 7) Projects are always unorganized Unfortunately, 1 bad leader can cause a lot of turn over. Usual cattiness between coworkers, although this was nothing new while working in retail. management, so much theft, unrealistic goals Even though I worked there for about 2 years, I received exactly minimum wage and about a 10-cent raise. I could easily go to a different place to get better pay for the same job responsibilities.

They want you to be a deterrent but people just wait to see if you're not working and steal when you're gone. - Lots of redundant paperwork. Taking inventory of all the empty hangers and reviewing footage of what people take is exhausting and boring. - You'll be kind of a custodian. Tidy up the store, hang signs, and rearrange layouts. - Small store, the same soundtrack plays all day and you'll slowly lose your mind. Unfortunately, 1 bad leader can cause a lot of turn over. Work better on scheduling. I have been here for like 2 years and starting off I was having like 3 shifts a week; and now I am lucky to have a shift a week. The manager has favorites and if you aren't one of them then you are lucked out. All associates at my store wants more hours but there are just too many associates there for everyone to get more hours, and then are hiring as people ask for more hours. There has been a long period of time that i wasn't be scheduled so I had to call the store and then i was placed on the schedule again, mind you I have had to call about this issue about 4 times now.

The company states they require you to work 45 hours a week on the written schedule, however, you must always have your phone on you 24/7, even when on vacation. You will be overworked and underpaid for it.

There was no recognition for the extreme hours from regional managers. End in-person collections (having to go to customers' homes to demand payment or merchandise). ""Field visits"" are marginally more effective than collection calls, at best, and extremely dangerous in worst-case scenarios. Talking to account managers and store managers with any tenure, it was extremely common for everyone to have stories of customers pulling guns. Basically you are a babysitter that gets the short end of the stick from your employees and supperiors. After 5yrs with the company, and one of the top performing stores, I was threatened to be terminated because of one bad month in sales due to a natural disaster that occurred. The company states they require you to work 45 hours a week on the written schedule, however, you must always have your phone on you 24/7, even when on vacation. You will be overworked and underpaid for it. There's a reason the turnover for GMs is so high.Understaffing unfortunately everyone is but keep in mind with understaffing it can make for a quicker but stressful day. Once restructured with what you got it is smooth sailing from there. The hours are horrible for furniture business No growth into new or higher positions. Sometimes it gets a little boring in the store. Can't always use time off Open on Sundays The pace can be pretty hard to keep up with, and you are on the phone nearly all of the time. Management was not supportive and spoke ill of other staff members The manager does not work or try to help anyone. She has a title that was basically given to her. She does not deserve to be manager. Everyone has quit or is quitting.

Work life balance sucks, low pay Can't always use time off Open on Sundays Stores are always understaffed due to the unrealistic expectations set by upper management, pressure from regional managers, and associate pay for department managers.

Not a ""con"", but just growing pains. Still a few pockets who are stuck in the past. Not much growth opportunities and pay could be more competitive. Customer Service is atrocious and no one takes ownership of anything. You will work long hours with no training selling a product that has a very long learning curve. If you couple the stress and endless/pointless meeting the money isn’t worth it. You will be responsible for thousands of accounts and close to $500M worth of revenue and have zero support. You will wake up to 200-300 emails each day and be responsible for goals that aren’t attainable by just one person. Teams get smaller and smaller and you will do the work of 5 people. Nepotism is rampant and there are many cliques. You’ll find that people are related to an executive, are close family friends, go on vacations together, etc. All in all, I would run from this place. I’ve never been as stressed out in my life. Diversity initiatives are lip service and are a joke and no support is given. Whether a reduction in force or termination (for real or made up reasons), you will be terminated with no warning. I was there for less than a year and saw this happen multiple times including myself. Cliques are rampant- if you aren’t in then you won’t be coached or trained. And if you don’t perform (or even do perform) you will be held to a standard not shared with you. Leadership is nonexistent. They preach this repeatedly, but don’t guide or give honest talent reviews. I often gave myself more introspective feedback than my leader would ever share When you do go, they will fight you over every last dime including severance or a notice period (which I shared earlier is under 24 hours) Nothing negative to say about the company Room for growth Personal advancement opportunities The management is incompetent The workers are overworked The night manager is incredibly rude to everybody. Definitely not worthy of being called a “leader” of anything. -Hard to grow career upwards -Pay didn't increase much over time. I feel like the employment screening process could be better. I believe that if they would require assessments for job seekers, they could weed out those who do not have the skills it takes to work here. Attention to detail, grammar skills, and the ability to follow directions are the skills I see that are lacking the most. Can work longer hours on occasion.

You will wake up to 200-300 emails each day and be responsible for goals that aren’t attainable by just one person. Teams get smaller and smaller and you will do the work of 5 people. Nepotism is rampant and there are many cliques. You’ll find that people are related to an executive, are close family friends, go on vacations together, etc. All in all, I would run from this place. I’ve never been as stressed out in my life. Diversity initiatives are lip service and are a joke and no support is given. Whether a reduction in force or termination (for real or made up reasons), you will be terminated with no warning. I was there for less than a year and saw this happen multiple times including myself. Cliques are rampant- if you aren’t in then you won’t be coached or trained. And if you don’t perform (or even do perform) you will be held to a standard not shared with you. Leadership is nonexistent. They preach this repeatedly, but don’t guide or give honest talent reviews. I often gave myself more introspective feedback than my leader would ever share When you do go, they will fight you over every last dime including severance or a notice period (which I shared earlier is under 24 hours) The management is incompetent The workers are overworked The night manager is incredibly rude to everybody. Definitely not worthy of being called a “leader” of anything. Nothing negative to say about the company Room for growth Personal advancement opportunities - Poor leadership, this is a top-down issue, and changing a name won't fix the issues in the company - The compensation wasn't as competitive as they'd like you to believe - Internal mobility is something that is strongly lacking - For a company the size that they are they have outdated processes and put band aid fixes on the issues - Leadership, including HR needs to have some level of sensitivity training, especially when it comes to laying people off -DEI programs seem to be for show, and limited impact is actually made due to the strategies not being enforced -Hard to grow career upwards -Pay didn't increase much over time. Huge company and you are just a number. They are beholden to wall street so the ideology felt like it was profit over everything. This meant no back filling positions and not resolving service issues caused by staffing issues. Leadership did not empower reps to solve issues and negotiate deals which is very frustrating."
