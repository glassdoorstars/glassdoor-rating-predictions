The active WMS keeps breaking, so you have to be on call most of the time. The leaders here do not know how to communicate properly and resort to micromanaging. They also refuse to listen and constantly interrupt. They also force you back into the office when most people here do not want to work, or if you are traveling for the past several months, they force you to come here to sit in their office. Also you have to go on calls really early or really late to coordinate with India team/offshore team, and no you will not get paid for it, and it is expected. Overall, I would not come here. The only successful people here are the ones that come here 2-4 years, then leave. As a side note my review has been removed 10-12 times by MANH leadership team, as they do not want you to see the negative reviews. Also note all the positive reviews that are only 2 sentences, and also note they are all from india. There is extremely high turnover b/c management is living in the stone age and have their offices behind glass walls and have no idea what they are doing. Training is few poor, learn by yourself Wish I had more vacation I dont have anything to add. Management is not flexible and open to new ideas They are cheap, don't pay very well Travel can be a ton One’s experience is very Product department dependent. Can often times be left on an island to resolve critical issues. How great of an experience you have is determined by staffing and project teammates, which is unfortuantely a roll of the dice.Too mucb traveling to client sites.

When I started in another city (still with AMR) with 0 experience I was making $19. I moved and with experience I was making $17 even though my new city has a higher cost of living. This is the worst job I’ve ever had in my 10 years of working. Supervisors and FTOs will say “You must be professional,” however they have zero emotional control and will get unprofessionally angry and treat you horribly. There is no work-life balance and if you have anything scheduled in your own life good luck having them balance around your life. Coworkers who are burnt out will treat you horribly, they pay you minimum wage. Fast food jobs are paying more than AMR. Even if you think you need to become an EMT as a stepping stone, there are better alternatives. They always wonder why they’re understaffed, but they don’t know how to pay or maintain employees. Not a good place, old employees and management will take their anger out on you for the most mundane reasons. Skip working at AMR as a stepping stone if you absolutely can. Other jobs will want to see you grow as a person, AMR will not. Long shifts and possibly running all day or night. Pay, co workers, management, uniform policy nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing Short staffed and long hours Long grueling hours, and not much time to rest.

This really changed the desirable nature of the position. Limited room for growth within departments.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Guitar-Center-Reviews-E6704.htm,"Growing up in the music industry, it was a big deal being able to work in the industry that modeled me. Met some great people and made some great friends Get to work around cool music gear, share the joy of music and great discount on equipment. If you are a musician, you are able to socialize with customers and better understand them. The employee discount is better than any I've seen. Coworkers are friendly and make you feel a part of the team from day one. On breaks you can take down guitars from the wall and jam out. The company has the best employee discount than any other music retailer you could work for and is a massive draw for employment at the company. The staff at most locations is always gonna be well versed in different instrumentation, tech, and sales tactics. I love the staff at Villa Park, IL Guitar Center as well. If you're getting into teaching give any location a shot. They do a lot for working musicians including time off to tour, and provide insurance incentives. Great experience meeting other up and coming musicians in the store and in the staff. Made connections that yielded the opportunities that allowed me to leave. Cool colleagues. Play guitar. Employee discount on equipment. If you love instruments & talking about them, this is a great place for you. Your day-to-day will usually consist of helping folks do something that you know is fun, i.e. getting a new guitar or effect pedal you demo’d, as well as finding cool & inspiring stuff for yourself to buy at discount. Employee discount on gear is by far the best perk of working here. In addition to being able to play and learn about all the gear at the store. Great for if your a musician and want hands on gear knowledge you wouldn't otherwise have access to. Also good if you're a musician looking to acquire some sales experience. They also are very flexible if you need gig leave. I got lucky and worked at a store with amazing people, but that has nothing to do with the company. The staff for the most part are very enjoyable individuals (although the older tenured staff can be rather cold,) and you often will have the opportunity to make your customers very happy.Growing up in the music industry, it was a big deal being able to work in the industry that modeled me.

The staff for the most part are very enjoyable individuals (although the older tenured staff can be rather cold,) and you often will have the opportunity to make your customers very happy.Growing up in the music industry, it was a big deal being able to work in the industry that modeled me. Met some great people and made some great friends If you are a musician, you are able to socialize with customers and better understand them. The employee discount is better than any I've seen. Coworkers are friendly and make you feel a part of the team from day one. On breaks you can take down guitars from the wall and jam out. The company has the best employee discount than any other music retailer you could work for and is a massive draw for employment at the company. The staff at most locations is always gonna be well versed in different instrumentation, tech, and sales tactics. I love the staff at Villa Park, IL Guitar Center as well. If you're getting into teaching give any location a shot. They do a lot for working musicians including time off to tour, and provide insurance incentives. Cool colleagues. Play guitar. Employee discount on equipment. If you love instruments & talking about them, this is a great place for you. Your day-to-day will usually consist of helping folks do something that you know is fun, i.e. getting a new guitar or effect pedal you demo’d, as well as finding cool & inspiring stuff for yourself to buy at discount. The staff for the most part are very enjoyable individuals (although the older tenured staff can be rather cold,) and you often will have the opportunity to make your customers very happy. Get to work around cool music gear, share the joy of music and great discount on equipment. Enjoy working with the people at the store. Great experience meeting other up and coming musicians in the store and in the staff. Made connections that yielded the opportunities that allowed me to leave.","Company went down hill fast Pay is low, can’t hire people if they can make more at a burger place next door and can only give them 10 hours a week. Going in I thought it would be a dream job, they offer a great discount but sadly you can not afford to buy anything. Unfortunately the company has become a joke and people only want to try out gear and then go buy online. They force you to sell the Pro Coverage, but I lost faith in it when a gentleman was denied. He jumped through ever hoop they said to do and he had a real issue but still was denied. At first bonuses were good but now they are nonexistent. They made promises to stock holders that they could not keep so to make up some ground they lay off people and cut back hours so much you could not run the store. Guitars were literally running out the front door because there is no floor coverage. Customer service can not happen when there are 2 people in the entire store, but that PC better be at 40% and your shrink numbers better be in line and sales better beat last year, forget the ridiculous forecast sale numbers. They can’t keep up with the stores they have and seem set on opening more. There is no stock unless you count the 12 red squire Stratocasters on the wall along with a few other lower price point guitars. Just very disappointing on so many levels. The lessons manager and 75% of the instructors left shortly after I left. I could go on and on. Operations Manager is possibly the most task intensive managment position in the entire company. They are expected to juggle and impossible amount of tasks on a daily basis. That along with the corporation trying to eliminate almost all full time positions that are not management, making it impossible to keep employees long term that you spent valuable time training to use Guitar Centers dated systems. With these cuts they have stretched management to their limits making it near impossible to keep up the standards of the store. Pay is now well below other retailers for almost every position. Corporate decides the amount of hours given to a Guitar Center location. So the full time employees are given there hours first, which essentially leaves part time staff with the scraps. This usually is not a problem, however when the company decides to cut back on hours this could mean a 2-day/12-hour work week for a part time employee. As an instructor scheduling can be difficult without permissions as an employee to the system so communication is key. The lessons lead turnover is about 2 people a year at the locations I've worked at (Arlington Heights, IL & Villa Park, IL), but the pros definitely out way the cons. I quit after working as a top sales associate for my location for over four years, putting up numbers at a small store that led in sales for most years, and doubling the required pro coverage metrics. I still made minimum wage the day I quit. Bad corporate practices bleed into the stores in ways you wouldn't believe, and turnover rate is insanely high. Commission is low, returns count against you, and at small stores even the top guys like myself were never taking home much extra. Difficult and unrewarding except as a stepping stone to better things. Low Pay. Undereducated staff with little accountability. High turnover rate with constantly changing work policies and Inconsistent Lesson Leads (lessons schedulers). The lead associates are frequently relied upon to do way more work than what they’re being paid for. They often need to do a store manager and/or CSM’s job at the same time as a lead, while also tripling as a salesperson. This results in the associates & store customers waiting on help for things above their head They do not pay a living wage. It used to be much better but since they overhauled the commission structure and only pay out half of what they used to its nearly impossible for a regular sales associate to make it their only source of income. Really only viable for college students as a summer job or a touring musician looking to make a few dollars in their downtime they can throw at some gear upgrades at this point. The only holidays you get off are Christmas and Thanksgiving. They will work you every other holiday. Half of the guys I manage were either fired or left due to ""company cuts"", leaving the rest of us in survival mode all day every day due to lack of staffing. Even now they are limiting my store manager's hours and we never have enough people. Everything that matters is outdated. This company's priorities are completely out of whack. All of the software we use crashes and freezes nearly every day, and some days for no reason will just decide to not open at all. Its extremely difficult to do your job when it takes 25 minutes to process a simple return and re-order because the system won't stop crashing. The computers are EXTREMELY slow too, and the company refuses to send us new ones. They make us send the same old broken computers in for repair where they send them right back. The pin pads are old and slow as well, taking around 10-15 seconds for them to process a single card swipe, and they crash all the time too. We have to move computer's constantly because of all the crashes. There is absolutely no division of labor. Sales associates have to appraise and buy in used gear, check people in and out for repairs, resolve order disputes, handle day to day operations, merch inventory, perform daily sales cold calls, defrag the store, organize the store, clean the store, handle customer service, maintain a 35 percentage of insurance plans sold, sell the store's credit card, acquire a certain amount of lessons sign ups every month, etc. It is by no means just a sales job. In addition to your regular sales responsibilities you will often be expected to have in depth knowledge of everything you are selling. If you don't all it does is lead to customer service issues. I can't tell you how many times a new guy tried to sell pro audio gear to someone and they call back furious because nothing is working. As a store lead I am also responsible for running opening and closing reports, managing staff, knowing how to manage the entirety of the lessons program and its students, mitigate and solve lessons disputes, handle all customer service issues, facilitate our store's gear insurance claims for customers, etc. There are no shortage of responsibilities and nothing is every easy or ""makes sense"". If you work for this company expect everything to go wrong constantly even on the simplest transaction. Even though you don't make commission as a store lead they still require you to sell and expect you to be topping the leaderboard. Your hours aren't consistent and you will often have to close nearly every night. There is such limited staffing that if you need to call off it will force another person to work the entire day or come in on an off day, causing friction between employees. There are so many small annoying issues that I couldn't possibly write them all out here. Insurance sales are absolutely necessary, and you will be fired if you cannot maintain above <30% insured instrument sales. You have to set aside your ethical values to succeed, which for many can be a troubling proposition. The company uses very old tech, which can be very efficient to use, but is riddled with problems such a slow speeds, shutdowns, terminals breaking, power strips not working, the roof leaking, etc... The company is certainly not making a great effort to maintain store standards.Company went down hill fast Pay is low, can’t hire people if they can make more at a burger place next door and can only give them 10 hours a week.

The company is certainly not making a great effort to maintain store standards.Company went down hill fast Pay is low, can’t hire people if they can make more at a burger place next door and can only give them 10 hours a week. Going in I thought it would be a dream job, they offer a great discount but sadly you can not afford to buy anything. Unfortunately the company has become a joke and people only want to try out gear and then go buy online. They force you to sell the Pro Coverage, but I lost faith in it when a gentleman was denied. He jumped through ever hoop they said to do and he had a real issue but still was denied. At first bonuses were good but now they are nonexistent. They made promises to stock holders that they could not keep so to make up some ground they lay off people and cut back hours so much you could not run the store. Guitars were literally running out the front door because there is no floor coverage. Customer service can not happen when there are 2 people in the entire store, but that PC better be at 40% and your shrink numbers better be in line and sales better beat last year, forget the ridiculous forecast sale numbers. They can’t keep up with the stores they have and seem set on opening more. There is no stock unless you count the 12 red squire Stratocasters on the wall along with a few other lower price point guitars. Just very disappointing on so many levels. The lessons manager and 75% of the instructors left shortly after I left. I could go on and on. Corporate decides the amount of hours given to a Guitar Center location. So the full time employees are given there hours first, which essentially leaves part time staff with the scraps. This usually is not a problem, however when the company decides to cut back on hours this could mean a 2-day/12-hour work week for a part time employee. As an instructor scheduling can be difficult without permissions as an employee to the system so communication is key. The lessons lead turnover is about 2 people a year at the locations I've worked at (Arlington Heights, IL & Villa Park, IL), but the pros definitely out way the cons. Low Pay. Undereducated staff with little accountability. High turnover rate with constantly changing work policies and Inconsistent Lesson Leads (lessons schedulers). The lead associates are frequently relied upon to do way more work than what they’re being paid for. They often need to do a store manager and/or CSM’s job at the same time as a lead, while also tripling as a salesperson. This results in the associates & store customers waiting on help for things above their head Insurance sales are absolutely necessary, and you will be fired if you cannot maintain above <30% insured instrument sales.

With these cuts they have stretched management to their limits making it near impossible to keep up the standards of the store. Pay is now well below other retailers for almost every position. Need better communication from upper management I quit after working as a top sales associate for my location for over four years, putting up numbers at a small store that led in sales for most years, and doubling the required pro coverage metrics.

This results in the associates & store customers waiting on help for things above their head They do not pay a living wage. It used to be much better but since they overhauled the commission structure and only pay out half of what they used to its nearly impossible for a regular sales associate to make it their only source of income. Really only viable for college students as a summer job or a touring musician looking to make a few dollars in their downtime they can throw at some gear upgrades at this point. The only holidays you get off are Christmas and Thanksgiving. They will work you every other holiday. Half of the guys I manage were either fired or left due to ""company cuts"", leaving the rest of us in survival mode all day every day due to lack of staffing. Even now they are limiting my store manager's hours and we never have enough people. Everything that matters is outdated. This company's priorities are completely out of whack. All of the software we use crashes and freezes nearly every day, and some days for no reason will just decide to not open at all. Its extremely difficult to do your job when it takes 25 minutes to process a simple return and re-order because the system won't stop crashing. The computers are EXTREMELY slow too, and the company refuses to send us new ones. They make us send the same old broken computers in for repair where they send them right back. The pin pads are old and slow as well, taking around 10-15 seconds for them to process a single card swipe, and they crash all the time too. We have to move computer's constantly because of all the crashes. There is absolutely no division of labor. Sales associates have to appraise and buy in used gear, check people in and out for repairs, resolve order disputes, handle day to day operations, merch inventory, perform daily sales cold calls, defrag the store, organize the store, clean the store, handle customer service, maintain a 35 percentage of insurance plans sold, sell the store's credit card, acquire a certain amount of lessons sign ups every month, etc. It is by no means just a sales job. In addition to your regular sales responsibilities you will often be expected to have in depth knowledge of everything you are selling. If you don't all it does is lead to customer service issues. I can't tell you how many times a new guy tried to sell pro audio gear to someone and they call back furious because nothing is working. As a store lead I am also responsible for running opening and closing reports, managing staff, knowing how to manage the entirety of the lessons program and its students, mitigate and solve lessons disputes, handle all customer service issues, facilitate our store's gear insurance claims for customers, etc. There are no shortage of responsibilities and nothing is every easy or ""makes sense"". If you work for this company expect everything to go wrong constantly even on the simplest transaction. Even though you don't make commission as a store lead they still require you to sell and expect you to be topping the leaderboard. Your hours aren't consistent and you will often have to close nearly every night. There is such limited staffing that if you need to call off it will force another person to work the entire day or come in on an off day, causing friction between employees. There are so many small annoying issues that I couldn't possibly write them all out here. Insurance sales are absolutely necessary, and you will be fired if you cannot maintain above <30% insured instrument sales.
