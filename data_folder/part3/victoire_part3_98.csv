Management and team leads were subject matter experts and professional. Workload was steady which gave chances to learn new things. However, it didnt stay that way as management began to change and more was added to everyone's workload without additional employees. Things might have changed since I left. However, when the last year I was there it was not a healthy work environment. All of those who were subject matter experts of the department either left or changed departments. New management (specifically team leads) were not adequate. They didn't know much, thus created office hours so co-workers can help each other since they couldn't help. If they did help, it took a while for them to figure it out. Due to the pandemic and changes in processes/polices, the workload became heavier with small raises and bonuses. Instead of hiring the right number of people, they added more to your workload and if you didn't keep up with the new workload, you were now underperforming. In addition, they actually got someone fired over some bs. I was shocked that they and HR got away with how they treated her. Hopefully, the team leads received adequate training on leadership and respect and its a better working environment. Bad apples spoiling efforts, miss labeled as a financial software company. Really we are acquisitions there is no central product for clients, and often times our sales people compete against one another. Additionally, they end up selling feature we don't have yet creating a firestorm without reward. I love my job but it really could be better Very busy and understaffed. The department lacks training and no one know what they are doing. Also the company is not diverse at all. No minorities in leadership.! Too relaxed in some areas, might be ok for some. None. Go work here pls. Pay is very low Don't value degrees salary is not as competitive Lower pay than industry standard, staffing.

At the time my assistant was only part time which left a lot of time on the manager end to accomplish tasks Depending on location there are times of high customer volume but with your team and values you're trained in, the sales floor is evenly distributed and the store runs smoothly. “Francescas promise” but really they just want you to annoy people Customers were rude, retail can be tolling. - Inconsistent hours - Bad management (in 3 years of working there, I have only had one good top manager. Others did things like leaving me (at 18) as the only person to run the store on our busiest day while all others were invited to the manager's birthday party.) - Low pay (I had to argue for $12 and was told $10 was average) - Quick employee turnaround - Low care for the brand by most employees mall hours, limited time off Being short staffed made it difficult at times for work life balance.

Some Assistant Managers are okay, some are not. At the current store manager at time of writing, Todd Celaya-Ewens, is absolutely terrible. Does not care about employees and uses generally shady practices. Corporate management levels (district and above) only gets worse the further up you go. Has completely slashed the customer service positions creating a nightmare for staff who are not equipped to deal with high level customer service issues and creating a worse experience for the customer. Absolutely terrible bonus program, practically nonexistent. Due to these issues, lots of staff turnover. They're changing a lot of things (values, culture, policies). I know a lot of good, smart people who are leaving due to these changes. They don't really give us enough space to think for ourselves anymore and they treat us like babies. Part-time benefits do not exist and there is a strict point system Hiring practices, they do not ever learn that to hire people, you need to pay them what the market is paying. If you don't then plan on a rough and frustrating holiday season ahead. They say ""we can't hire because we don;t have the hours"" then how do you service the customer? I had 3 people walk out last weekend cause we could not get to them. Plan on people calling out, because they absolutely will, then you are stuck with one associate on the floor for an entire shift. But that seems to be OK for mgmt, payroll hours go down. Shortsighted when you have sales goals you are asked to meet. Industrial engineers sit behind a desk 75% of the day managing a spreadsheet. Time studies are conducted and afterwards nothing happens to your data or suggestions from the observation, especially safety concerns. Work from home is only allowed for corporate associates and a select group of salary and hourly associates. Do not expect to travel much in this position, despite the ""regional"" title. Upper management does not have a long term plans or goals in mind, just taking it day by day hoping for the best. Knowing fluent Spanish is absolutely required for this position Pay is MUCH lower than industry standard and there is little room for growth. Managers are ineffective in leading their teams. Constant emergency deadlines and disorganization is the norm. I have never worked anywhere with such high turnover. The management and executive team is in over the heads and do not handle associate issues effectively. Bonuses and growth opportunities are very slim. Not the best pay; not minimum wage but close to it. Also mainly have numerous part time employees rather than a few solid full time employees, I assume to avoid having to pay for OT and benefits. Some items are heavy, so the work can get tough if you're out of shape 💪😂 there seems to be a fair amount of turnover in management.

When I brought this up to my manager, they took days to even respond. In my first three weeks I had 1 hour of time with my manager. Whenever I suggested anything they all smiled and said yeah, that's great. But then said they were already set on doing it their way, which already was not working for the past few years. Lot's of lip service to encouraging new ideas, but if you make any effort to implement, they drive out all motivation you have. They are constantly changing and making no forward progress. They've been coached to say the things that lead to success, but they don't actually have the right people leading. -sometimes it's too ""corporate"" even when they say they try to give you the small employer feel. They miss the mark a few times. Follow process for the sake of following process, etc -silos can get in the way, but at least they admit it The training is a bit too fast. They tell us the whole time ""I know it feels like it's so quick to go on the phones but we're here to help"", and ""give yourself some grace, you're in training""...yet they take forever to answer questions in the chat when we need help. Also someone in my training got fired over a MISTAKE that they made.. yet, 'give yourself some grace, you're in training' is thrown all over the place here.. Also, I was sick and had barely any voice.. like could barely hear me even, and all I was told ""I'm so sorry I wish I had control over whether or not you have to go over the phones but I'm not"" by my trainer... they teach ""sympathy/empathy/understanding"" for the customer yet they don't have it with their employees.. Management knows that they have given too much work to the employees but they are too callous and/or clueless to hire the needed amount of employees. Extremely stressful work environment You will soon get so far behind that you will never catch up, even after you give notice. Personal lines field adjusters get a minimum of 18 claims per week including at least 2 fire claims Management neither leads nor inspires Your job duties will be intentionally vague so they can be misconstrued to your disadvantage Difficult now to really take PTO because only one person per team is allowed to be off at a time. Something I truly don't understand because, when Flex was in place, almost every Friday had teams running at half staff and we all managed to get by. Once the company became AFICS, everything went downhill - people leading the company who have outright said ""I hate people"", Flex time taken away, upper management who seem to have NO clue how to run a large company, leaders way too focused on metrics and numbers that they forget about us minions who drive the metrics, computer system that can barely keep up and is always having some sort of an issue, lack in communication, work loads are WAY TOO MUCH yet we are all expected to have awesome metrics and near perfect claims (who can have near perfection when we handle close to 200 claims sometimes?!), upper management who doesn't seem to know in any way the jobs us minions do, upper management who don't listen to us minions (example - we say we are overworked - upper management decreases the number of people in teams)...I can say more but this is already long. Cmms and inventory is in shambles, absolutely dropped the ball on retirement turn over leading to a lack of knowledge and short staffing. Should have been back filling slots 5 years ago. Now has a penny pinching VP of finance meddling in department affairs. Constant unrealistic goals of reducing expense YOY which is being implemented at the cost of reliability and via layoffs the worst possible ways to cut. They also strategically cut employees during the same year that they made record breaking profits... Unrealistic goals combined with greed leads to short sighted methods to achieve goals. Leadership from the director level up have an incentive to meet the goals short-term even at long-term cost to the company. (Bonus bigger than my salary) Pretty much like they're squeezing blood from a turnip until they eventually just dismantle the entire department via attrition and outsource it. Those same people will be long gone when it falls apart and blows up in the next person's face. The moment the cost benefit analysis comes up in a third-party's favor in house workers will be shown the door. Mistake ridden company wasting billions of dollars. It starts at the top. Executive management is aloof and incompetent for past 10 years but take millions in pay and bonuses while destroying a company built over 100 years. Executive management leans on consulting companies for big decisions which only confirms they don't know how to run a large company. Politics and virtue signaling dominates a lot of management who are also incompetent lap dogs yapping on Twitter with executive management. Leadership made failed acquisitions in attempt to grow that have only made the environment more political and acquired employees have failed by wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on stupid ideas. Middle management is incompetent as they try to virtue signal and suck up their way to the top. DEI hirings that support all the politics but that further destroys the idea that merit counts for anything. It doesn't, which make environment more political. Policy changes of encouraging remote work forever and now back to office is a nightmare for employees Company does not give pay scale raises when the minimum base rate of pay is increased. Therefore, employees that have worked here a number of years do not make much more than new employees with no experience. Do you want no training and to be overworked and overwhelmed. Welcome to the jungle. I was at AmFam for 6 years before running to a lower paying job to be free of this hell. QA and training were entirely removed after a huge shift and corporate growth. First and second level managers are good or ok, but they're just as ignored as front line employees. I'd say you'll feel like a corporate cog, but the feeling is more akin to a bug under a boot. They used to care, they used to listen, then this little Midwestern company grew too big, too fast and lost their way. If you're good at your job, you're stuck. If you suck, you've got a fair chance at failing upward. Either way, You. Will. Hate. It. Oh, and they don't want you to know that anyone hired after about 2018 doesn't get a pension like their coworkers hired before that. I have up a pension and took a $6 pay cut for the sake of my sanity and physical health.commission based, performance based income isn't for everyone.

They used to care, they used to listen, then this little Midwestern company grew too big, too fast and lost their way. If you're good at your job, you're stuck. If you suck, you've got a fair chance at failing upward. Either way, You. Will. Hate. It. Oh, and they don't want you to know that anyone hired after about 2018 doesn't get a pension like their coworkers hired before that. I have up a pension and took a $6 pay cut for the sake of my sanity and physical health.commission based, performance based income isn't for everyone. The job I was hired for was completely different from what responsibilities they gave me. When I brought this up to my manager, they took days to even respond. In my first three weeks I had 1 hour of time with my manager. Whenever I suggested anything they all smiled and said yeah, that's great. But then said they were already set on doing it their way, which already was not working for the past few years. Lot's of lip service to encouraging new ideas, but if you make any effort to implement, they drive out all motivation you have. They are constantly changing and making no forward progress. They've been coached to say the things that lead to success, but they don't actually have the right people leading. -sometimes it's too ""corporate"" even when they say they try to give you the small employer feel. They miss the mark a few times. Follow process for the sake of following process, etc -silos can get in the way, but at least they admit it The training is a bit too fast. They tell us the whole time ""I know it feels like it's so quick to go on the phones but we're here to help"", and ""give yourself some grace, you're in training""...yet they take forever to answer questions in the chat when we need help. Also someone in my training got fired over a MISTAKE that they made.. yet, 'give yourself some grace, you're in training' is thrown all over the place here.. Also, I was sick and had barely any voice.. like could barely hear me even, and all I was told ""I'm so sorry I wish I had control over whether or not you have to go over the phones but I'm not"" by my trainer... they teach ""sympathy/empathy/understanding"" for the customer yet they don't have it with their employees.. Management knows that they have given too much work to the employees but they are too callous and/or clueless to hire the needed amount of employees. Extremely stressful work environment You will soon get so far behind that you will never catch up, even after you give notice. Personal lines field adjusters get a minimum of 18 claims per week including at least 2 fire claims Management neither leads nor inspires Your job duties will be intentionally vague so they can be misconstrued to your disadvantage Difficult now to really take PTO because only one person per team is allowed to be off at a time. Something I truly don't understand because, when Flex was in place, almost every Friday had teams running at half staff and we all managed to get by. Once the company became AFICS, everything went downhill - people leading the company who have outright said ""I hate people"", Flex time taken away, upper management who seem to have NO clue how to run a large company, leaders way too focused on metrics and numbers that they forget about us minions who drive the metrics, computer system that can barely keep up and is always having some sort of an issue, lack in communication, work loads are WAY TOO MUCH yet we are all expected to have awesome metrics and near perfect claims (who can have near perfection when we handle close to 200 claims sometimes?!), upper management who doesn't seem to know in any way the jobs us minions do, upper management who don't listen to us minions (example - we say we are overworked - upper management decreases the number of people in teams)...I can say more but this is already long. Cmms and inventory is in shambles, absolutely dropped the ball on retirement turn over leading to a lack of knowledge and short staffing. Should have been back filling slots 5 years ago. Now has a penny pinching VP of finance meddling in department affairs. Constant unrealistic goals of reducing expense YOY which is being implemented at the cost of reliability and via layoffs the worst possible ways to cut. They also strategically cut employees during the same year that they made record breaking profits... Unrealistic goals combined with greed leads to short sighted methods to achieve goals. Leadership from the director level up have an incentive to meet the goals short-term even at long-term cost to the company. (Bonus bigger than my salary) Pretty much like they're squeezing blood from a turnip until they eventually just dismantle the entire department via attrition and outsource it. Those same people will be long gone when it falls apart and blows up in the next person's face. The moment the cost benefit analysis comes up in a third-party's favor in house workers will be shown the door. Mistake ridden company wasting billions of dollars. It starts at the top. Executive management is aloof and incompetent for past 10 years but take millions in pay and bonuses while destroying a company built over 100 years. Executive management leans on consulting companies for big decisions which only confirms they don't know how to run a large company. Politics and virtue signaling dominates a lot of management who are also incompetent lap dogs yapping on Twitter with executive management. Leadership made failed acquisitions in attempt to grow that have only made the environment more political and acquired employees have failed by wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on stupid ideas. Middle management is incompetent as they try to virtue signal and suck up their way to the top. DEI hirings that support all the politics but that further destroys the idea that merit counts for anything. It doesn't, which make environment more political. Policy changes of encouraging remote work forever and now back to office is a nightmare for employees Company does not give pay scale raises when the minimum base rate of pay is increased. Therefore, employees that have worked here a number of years do not make much more than new employees with no experience. Do you want no training and to be overworked and overwhelmed.

Once the company became AFICS, everything went downhill - people leading the company who have outright said ""I hate people"", Flex time taken away, upper management who seem to have NO clue how to run a large company, leaders way too focused on metrics and numbers that they forget about us minions who drive the metrics, computer system that can barely keep up and is always having some sort of an issue, lack in communication, work loads are WAY TOO MUCH yet we are all expected to have awesome metrics and near perfect claims (who can have near perfection when we handle close to 200 claims sometimes?!), upper management who doesn't seem to know in any way the jobs us minions do, upper management who don't listen to us minions (example - we say we are overworked - upper management decreases the number of people in teams)...I can say more but this is already long. Cmms and inventory is in shambles, absolutely dropped the ball on retirement turn over leading to a lack of knowledge and short staffing. Should have been back filling slots 5 years ago.

Constant unrealistic goals of reducing expense YOY which is being implemented at the cost of reliability and via layoffs the worst possible ways to cut. They also strategically cut employees during the same year that they made record breaking profits... Unrealistic goals combined with greed leads to short sighted methods to achieve goals. Leadership from the director level up have an incentive to meet the goals short-term even at long-term cost to the company.

Executive management is aloof and incompetent for past 10 years but take millions in pay and bonuses while destroying a company built over 100 years. Executive management leans on consulting companies for big decisions which only confirms they don't know how to run a large company. Politics and virtue signaling dominates a lot of management who are also incompetent lap dogs yapping on Twitter with executive management. Leadership made failed acquisitions in attempt to grow that have only made the environment more political and acquired employees have failed by wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on stupid ideas. Middle management is incompetent as they try to virtue signal and suck up their way to the top. DEI hirings that support all the politics but that further destroys the idea that merit counts for anything. It doesn't, which make environment more political. Policy changes of encouraging remote work forever and now back to office is a nightmare for employees Company does not give pay scale raises when the minimum base rate of pay is increased. Therefore, employees that have worked here a number of years do not make much more than new employees with no experience. Do you want no training and to be overworked and overwhelmed. Welcome to the jungle. I was at AmFam for 6 years before running to a lower paying job to be free of this hell. QA and training were entirely removed after a huge shift and corporate growth. First and second level managers are good or ok, but they're just as ignored as front line employees. I'd say you'll feel like a corporate cog, but the feeling is more akin to a bug under a boot. They used to care, they used to listen, then this little Midwestern company grew too big, too fast and lost their way. If you're good at your job, you're stuck. If you suck, you've got a fair chance at failing upward. Either way, You. Will. Hate. It. Oh, and they don't want you to know that anyone hired after about 2018 doesn't get a pension like their coworkers hired before that. I have up a pension and took a $6 pay cut for the sake of my sanity and physical health.commission based, performance based income isn't for everyone. The job I was hired for was completely different from what responsibilities they gave me. When I brought this up to my manager, they took days to even respond. In my first three weeks I had 1 hour of time with my manager. Whenever I suggested anything they all smiled and said yeah, that's great. But then said they were already set on doing it their way, which already was not working for the past few years. Lot's of lip service to encouraging new ideas, but if you make any effort to implement, they drive out all motivation you have. They are constantly changing and making no forward progress. They've been coached to say the things that lead to success, but they don't actually have the right people leading. The training is a bit too fast. They tell us the whole time ""I know it feels like it's so quick to go on the phones but we're here to help"", and ""give yourself some grace, you're in training""...yet they take forever to answer questions in the chat when we need help. Also someone in my training got fired over a MISTAKE that they made.. yet, 'give yourself some grace, you're in training' is thrown all over the place here.. Also, I was sick and had barely any voice.. like could barely hear me even, and all I was told ""I'm so sorry I wish I had control over whether or not you have to go over the phones but I'm not"" by my trainer... they teach ""sympathy/empathy/understanding"" for the customer yet they don't have it with their employees.. Management knows that they have given too much work to the employees but they are too callous and/or clueless to hire the needed amount of employees.

The culture is horrible. Everyone is rude and the company does not care about taking the time to fully train the freelancers. unrealistic sales goals, favoritism, no paid days off Don't expect to ever make a livable wage here as an artist. Any promotions will lead you farther away from time doing actual makeup application and more with back-end corporate responsibilities. This job is suitable for someone who doesn't really need to work or looking for very part time and hands on experience applying makeup (which is being phased out anyway). You are expected to attain large sales goals depending on how many days you work that week. If you happen to call out sick or are ill one day, you are still required to achieve the initial sales goal pre call out, so basically never be sick. Expect to be told to be able to multitask and attend to every customer when staff is extremely short in an environment where it used to be double. This brand has been a slow burn for a long time and for good reason. Old business model, lack of innovation and keeping up with trends, comparable if not better products available at lower cost at Ulta or any drugstore. This company used to value artistry but that ship sailed a long time ago. It might have been great when the market was less saturated but its demographic is essentially people who don't like change. It may not happen as quickly as Morphe but I forsee this brand shutting down more stores in time and they have no one to blame but themselves. retail shifts, local management is different than global guidelines company is broke and cutting costs increasing your workload / lots of politics working with this many women (regional management), no one on one from your manager for training help / how to run a store/ business There staff is very disrespectfulunrealistic sales goals, favoritism, no paid days off Work culture has changed drastically.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Heartland-Dental-Reviews-E196086.htm,"Employment provides education and growth From the moment I started working at Heartland Dental, I knew I had found something truly special. My job isn't just a means of earning a living; it's a profound passion that fills my days with purpose, joy, and endless opportunities for growth. I can't help but gush about how much I love my job. What sets my job apart is its alignment with my values and interests. It's not just about tasks and responsibilities; it's about contributing to something larger than myself. The sense of fulfillment I get from knowing that my efforts contribute to meaningful projects is unparalleled. I've found a role that allows me to express my talents, engage my mind, and make a positive impact on the world around me. Heartland has a big focus on training and education. There are so many opportunities for growth if you're willing to put in the work and grow yourself. They have great culture and most of the people I've every came into contact with have been great people. They put a large focus on people and relationship building. Great systems that bring positive results CE - ish, their CE is only good if you are a new grad. If you are an established dentist there is no benefit. there is nothing at all Overall they are okay. They have systems in place that work if followed. It’s really the luck of the drawl of the people you are with though. If they like you they invest in you. The leadership training is amazing. Great integrity in all dealings Autonomy when practice is profitable Organized and great systems Bargaining power of DSO when dealing with insurance companies Empowers women Lots of training and continuing education, good benefits, and opportunity for growth Can’t think of any pros, sad..","Bonuses are difficult to receive The company does not offer a match for your 401k contributions, but you do have the option to invest in stock. Because the company has gotten so big the culture can get lost in translation so you have to make a conscious decision to create the culture in your practice, sub region, region. They have high, sometimes unrealistic expectations. Can be very goal/numbers driven. A LOT of meetings and calls/emails. Do NOT go into a de novo or affiliation practice. You will not make enough to profit share & their base isn't good. have to wait a year for benefits will make you work 46+ hours a week short staffed so you can’t take a break can never keep the office fully staffed Some PMOs don’t follow set systems in place. Most of them don’t even work all day. Basically part time managers and then if something is wrong it’s everyone one else’s fault. Some of them seem wishy washy in decision making. Also raises aren’t guaranteed.. it’s like an act of congress to get a raise approved. I believe in what HD stands for, but something recently changed. I've never felt like just another number but now I do. Don't matter how hard working you are everything is your fault. I've had to juggle alot recently and have gone out of my way to support and help other practices in my region but now I'm all of a sudden not a good worker when the months preceding had amazing feedback. I'm negative because I'm asking questions to better understand and work through stages of change. What happened to understanding DISC personality and compassion and communication that honored someone's personality. If you wanna grow won't happen unless your in the club with that team. Otherwise you have no chance. No balance at all. Manager required to work 6-7 days but they tell you 40 hours which is not true.. no consideration for driving. More emails than anyone can really handle Meetings that frequently interfere with workday Over worked, promoting based on friendships, lower pay. Many cons, beware- abusive managers and doctors, the vision and mission would be believable if they treated their employees correctly Do not match 401k Changed medical insurance, many providers do not accept Need more diversity, hardly any males working with this company- females with hormones reacting like lunatics If I could submit less stars I would"
