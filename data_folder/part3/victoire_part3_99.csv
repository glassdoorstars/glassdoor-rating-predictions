I don't think of this as a con but some people may so I'll reiterate, you do have to actually work hard here. I feel like a lot of people want to come go to work, coast, make money and leave but you won't be successful on the sales side without real effort and they aren't looking to bring in people who don't hustle. I'm not saying you have to work a bunch of OT, more than you need to really make the most of your 8 hours of work, but if you are only interested in putting in the bare minimum, you won't be successful here. Busy work, team player mentality, set path for growth Scheduling was a nightmare. Was consistently told that I was to be at a certain location at a certain time, when I said that couldn't be correct because that location is having school during those hours, I was told to leave my house immediately, got to the school/vax center and was turned away by security guards. Took rounds and rounds of calls all day every day to reach a reasonable schedule/location. Was lied to about opportunities for transfer. Dealing with payroll was also an absolute nightmare. Like, emails every single day. None so far it’s good to work for a company that has your back! Working here did come with its own set of challenges, particularly related to the fast-paced startup culture. The nature of my role often required wearing many hats, which at times translated into a high workload. Balancing multiple responsibilities concurrently could be demanding and at times stressful. But, it's worth mentioning that this dynamic environment was instrumental in my rapid professional development. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, compelling me to constantly adapt, learn, and improve, thereby accelerating my career progression. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, that required a high level of dedication and adaptability. High workload can be stressful at times Time away from family, and uncertainty some dept leaders don't embody the image/culture/values Aya is selling; need more compassionate, empathetic, high EQ, empowering leaders - some are just fear-based power hungry control-freaks trying to build their empires and out for themselves; smart, talented people need more autonomy to call the shots and keep internal clients happy instead of being fearful of acting or doing anything; more people in legal dept should be empowered and report to others outside the legal dept so everything is not biased and filtered through a single person's potentially self-serving point of view; can be underpaying if you don't stand up for yourself contract working can be exhausting if you don't like to be looking for jobsSometimes there are no assignments.

They tell kids they have a place in housing, then just before arriving, they suddenly don't. This whole county is a ski resort and I'm a long-time local, if you're not in housing before the ski season starts, you probably won't be. They pretend like they don't have enough parking passes for their half-empty employee parking then regularly put boots on up to three tires. At $150 each to remove they're making a lot of money off of these kids. They promise full-time hours, but once the Christmas rush is over people's hours can drop down to 10 hours a week. As a manager this was frustrating, there were so many things we could've gotten done during slow times to get ready for the spring rush, but they wouldn't let us keep ourselves staffed. The job was fun and I liked my coworkers, but the way upper management treated employees as extendible was an emotionally heavy thing to live with.

Incompetent management focused on their own ego at time. Often overworked due to salaried role. Affordability of area on the salary. Employee housing treating you like a disposable number. Inconsistency of perks such as employee meals Vail doesn't care about the workers or the local communities. Housing is a huge issue in mountain towns and can be impossible to find and expensive if you can. Meanwhile vail pays most of its employee barely more then minimum wage and has little to no benefits or housing to offer. If you want to live and work in a ski town you're better off working in restaurants than on the resort. It is still the lowest paying employer in the area, even with the pay increase. But it is pretty close to what you can earn elsewhere. The job is also dangerous.

Vail Resorts doesn’t care at all about their retail part of the company - they do no sort of product knowledge training like other outdoor retail companies do. I am a female, and when I asked to attend MasterFit (a professional boot fitting course - so I could actually know the products I’m selling), I was told ‘We normally send the guys to MasterFit.’ And when I said I wanted to attend Demo Days at Loveland (again, to test out the products I’m selling), I was told, ‘The guys usually go and the girls stay back and work at the store.’ At this time, my partner was in an equal position at another outdoor store and was making over $10/hour more than what I was making at Vail. Their ‘company values’ are nothing more than just buzzwords that sound good to shareholders. All of the recycling in the store just got thrown into the dump every night. And I didn’t get paid for the time I spent making the night drop at the bank after closing on the nights that I closed the store. You have to work all holidays but you don’t get paid holiday pay for Vail because ‘they’re a seasonal company’ - even though my job was technically coded as ‘year-round, full time’.

It is a great place to work and people doing well ARE able to make good money here. The executive team ALWAYS has a platform for reps to help make SolarCity a better place every quarter.

Never had trouble meeting quota and in-house financing and leasing made it super easy to close deals. Best if area is a newer suburban area with most homes built after 1960. Everyone like a win win situation... SolarCity is a win, win, win, win, win, win and so on situation. I win my doing WELL for my family, my customers win becauase they keep money they would otherwise surrender to a monopoly, the monopoly wins because we are helping them achieve a mandate for clean electricity with letting investment on their part AND we reduce stress on the aging grid AND we impose competitive pressure on them so, eventually the monopoly will no longer be a monopoly and will actually have to WORK to keep customers. The local community wins because we create and retain great paying jobs in the community at the same time as freeing our customer's budget to have more money to invest in local businesses. Local non profits win because of partnerships we create that put money in their coffers.

Pay is below what technicians inside and outside the company make. No overtime except for storms which is rare. Bonuses aren't reliable, can vary in payment year to year. No incentive to stay in position when you can make more money as a technician or move to another department and make more. A big unwieldy corporate structure that struggles to effectively communicate between departments. There are often occasions that teams are working on the same thing without realizing it or discovering that another teams project is interfering or blocking one on your team. Considering how many meetings there are, it is surprising how much of a disconnect is between business units. Hire friends over qualified candidates usually business model changes frequently No work life balance. Compensation did not reflect the amount of work put into the job. Average to sub average benefits package (minimal 401k match with a vesting period, full sick time pay only after a year of service, average health care options). Continual inaction of upper management was extremely demotivating. Department needed to realistically double in size to support the multiple businesses within the company. I'm burned out just after a year. I can’t think of any cons on call 24/7 for storms Depending on location not much opportunity for career movement.Technology out of date High Turnover as of late Management changes too frequently and it can be difficult to know who to talk to within the company.

Salaries can lag behind other industries, and the formal policies and procedures can feel kind of stifling - title growth and internal promotion are still close to 100% seniority based. The organization is also pretty siloed and, I mean, it is a utility - change isn't always celebrated and thinking can be rigid. So ambition is checked not only by seniority focused policies but also by the way that going above and beyond may sometimes not be welcomed.Technology out of date High Turnover as of late Management changes too frequently and it can be difficult to know who to talk to within the company.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Duke-Health-Reviews-E18988.htm,"Worked one on one with 2 preceptors. Gained valuable nursing skills and experiences that have helped me grow as a nurse. I worked at Duke for over 10 years such a great place to work. Medical insurance is decent, opportunity to meet ppl from different clinics, some great coworkers and doctors, use Duke to gain experience to build your resume and grow elsewhere. - CICU staff have amazing teamwork and truly care about each other -pay rate is decent although workload is getting heavier so that may change in the future -great educational resources for staff There are definitely great people to learn from at Duke, good benefits Great benefits with insurance, tuition reimbursement, loan forgiveness, and sometimes sign-on bonuses. Duke has done a lot since COVID to increase RN salary. In my 2.5 years there, my salary went up by 75%. There are a lot of university resources beyond the health system that benefit staff. Great learning opportunities. Teaching hospital. Surrounded by brilliant people. Great office culture and work life balance. Very friendly environment and helpful coworkers. Extensive training and onboarding Duke name and reputation. Great providers using new technology. Team work, inclusion, flexibility, supportive management Solid insurance, best retirement contribution around probably","It is a big hospital system. No cons to working there. Poor dental insurance, lazy/nonchalant management, respect based on job titles and not work ethic therefore causing low employee morale, no room/opportunities to grow as a MA but they will dump the work load on you yet find something to complain about each and every time making it hard to enjoy your job and the patients because the work load is so heavy, anxiety/stress at an all time HIGH, issues brought up but never properly addressed, you can transfer all you want within these clinics but the issues with remain the same sometimes going from bad to WORSE, TURNOVER RATE is through the roof in these clinics and 10/10 management is the one to blame, duties and pay don’t match up. Pay is laughable to say the least which is the main reason for such short staffing yet agency/travel staff get paid double,triple, quadruple to do the EXACT same job as YOU after you train them of course …make it make sense please I’ll wait - The frequency of floating is ridiculous and makes me feel that I am not valued or needed as an employee. CICU is purposefully overstaffed so that we can staff the rest of the hospital. Just confirms we are a cog in the machine. There have been reports that Duke hired more nurses to help with this for a while now, yet no changes are being made. There are many unsafe assignments that you cannot refuse and even if you float to another unit, they will make you precept one of their new hires or students. - Management allows poor behavior or work ethic to continue without action unless its something super serious (i.e. patients life in danger) - parking is expensive unless you only work nights and weekends Duke subscribes to the “give everyone the same raise” theory. I’ve been at Duke for over a decade, and from what I’ve seen, everyone who is in “good standing” with Duke receives the same exact percentage raise. I feel like this promotes mediocrity. It can be frustrating to give more effort than some coworkers who end up with the same raise anyway. And if those coworkers have a higher base salary, they actually end up with a larger raise. I don’t understand why Duke doesn’t use their performance reviews as a barometer for pay raises. There is a lot of politics. Power-hungry managers that pick their favorites and have a double standard. A lot of the conversations around staff wellness, diversity and inclusion, and unit improvements happen to save face. Many meetings with upper management happen around magnet designation, and I've not seen a single concern/feedback from a staff member addressed with action. Meanwhile, there's so much talk, and talk only. Everyone, new and experienced, eventually leaves this powerful institution jaded and tired. Compensation is low and the work load is heavy. There is still the “old boys club” to work through. Despite having an Office of Equity bad behavior of showing inclusion still exist. There are no true cons. Hides behind ""patient care"" as reasons to ignore or discredit your legitimate boundaries, burnout, or concern about over extension (even in situations where safety or health aren't in jeopardy, this is the justification used to bully ancillary and support services too) Limited recruiting efforts, so teams are chronically under staffed, some roles being open for a year+... our department Director role has been vacant for over a year, so the AD and manager are stretched super thin, Social work is seen to have limited to no value in the system, so we aren't brought in for planning conversations. Leading to us pointing out all kinds of avoidable issues when we do learn about things, but it's often too late to fix, then there's a back and firth about role and who will take on the additional duties... There's no upward job mobility or career ladder, at least in social work/case management dept. Yeah, skip duke, work remote for an insurance company or one of the MCOs, don't pay for parking, And javelin a better salary"

Taking off to go back to my hometown during holidays is absolutely something I should’ve asked about prior to accepting the role. After taking off to go home on Thanksgiving, Christmas came around and I was told that I couldn’t take off since I had taken off for Thanksgiving.

Pay is lower than would like Some safety concerns Benefits are expensive No market adjustment of salary Upper management DM's who are put in that position simply due to lack of options that have no business being in such a position due to their lack of interpersonal skills. The fact that a rumor,a fictitious made up accusation can get you fired no matter how dedicated or how good and proficient of a worker you are. Nothing of the good you bring to that job and the things you help get accomplished for the store to operate as it should even matters over someone's made up accusations. Within 5 minutes of me being terminated the same person who falsely accused me was the stores new CEM. Nothing is set in stone. No processes are simple or consistent. You’re not given much support in the form of tools and programs needed to work efficiently. It always feels like you’re building the airplane while it’s already taking off.
