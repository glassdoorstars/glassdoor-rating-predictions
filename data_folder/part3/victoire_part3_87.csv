Quarterly required trainings and you are shamed into/ bullied into partaking in additional projects and this is all outside of your daily work schedule which means it cuts into your personal/family time. There is no work/life balance unless you TAKE it and are strict about controlling your personal schedule. You get treated like a number. A machine.

Less than 24 hours later, you will be erased and replaced. Upper management does not care about their employees. For massive layoffs of workforce, department management is not part of who goes, which they should be.. They just do random layoffs not based on performance, work ethic, longevity, pay scale or need within the area having cut backs. . -Top management's out of touch/unrealistic targets and forecast -Lower base salary than the other big firms -Either low or no performance bonus at all -If you're from another firm, the audit platform (KPMG Clara/KCW) is not that complex but has a lot of BS requirements. You would spend more time working on KCW file than the actual audit work. Also, it's typical to find limitations and conflicting functions using the platform. -Use of tech in audit is so forced and shoved down your throats rather than deployed smoothly. -Performance assessments is a hit or miss.

Leadership may have bit off more than they can chew by over-hiring and overpaying resulting in the need for layoffs. This may have been corrected in 2023, but the leadership has not changed. Depending on the group/practice, you may find that the professionals are not strong in the subject matter. You may also find that projects are oversold both on a resource side as well as a competency from the team side, and are struggling to complete the work and to complete it with high quality.

Leadership may have bit off more than they can chew by over-hiring and overpaying resulting in the need for layoffs. This may have been corrected in 2023, but the leadership has not changed. Depending on the group/practice, you may find that the professionals are not strong in the subject matter. You may also find that projects are oversold both on a resource side as well as a competency from the team side, and are struggling to complete the work and to complete it with high quality. This leads to unhappy clients and unhappy team members This company expects you to overwork. You have numerous REQUIRED deliverables; in addition to your client work. Quarterly required trainings and you are shamed into/ bullied into partaking in additional projects and this is all outside of your daily work schedule which means it cuts into your personal/family time. There is no work/life balance unless you TAKE it and are strict about controlling your personal schedule. You get treated like a number. A machine. You're replaceable, so don't believe in the ""KPMG is a family"" talk. KPMG has had major layoffs over the past couple of years, and the departures didn't impact anyone.

This can be very challenging for those with families of their own and other extracurricular activities. Also, in my experience, a Big 4 office will have a larger workforce than most other accounting firms, so you must be aware that you will be dealing with different personalities and professionals that may be stricter and more volatile than others.

Not always easy, everything specific to Arrow Revolving door company - talent comes and goes. Management's only focus is staying within budget - and there is not a lot of investment in branches. The company promotes ""5 Years Out,"" but they're about 10 years behind in management style. Senior management is stuck in the 9-5, Boomer mentality. Corporate marketing is based on Formula-1 and the word ""Arrow."" Despite no one knowing what Arrow does. Talent is exhausted and people quickly leave. Culture is non existent. If you go into the office, you're greeted by 7 floors of cold climate cubicles. If you're lucky enough for remote work, then it's not bad. The coffee is bad - made by a machine. There were snacks, not anymore. Budgeting and all, I guess. Oh, and no kudos for hard work. You're given more complex work. And no training either. You're shadowing someone anywhere from 4 days to a week, then sent to the wolves. Also, these people your shadowing are also stupid busy too. No formal training is there, since there's no process documents. If you can survive on 'no news is good news,' then you're in luck. Arrow has been pushing initiatives on career development and opportunities the past year, but I have not experienced any of this in my current department. I don't believe it's an earnest initiative on their part. There are also no known opportunities to cross train or learn from other departments. Everyone stays in their own silos and it's nearly impossible to branch out into other areas of interest. Arrow also seems to like to vastly underpay. In my case, it's around $20k under market easily. I have been seeking to rectify this situation with my management, but they have been doing everything possible to delay and avoid this discussion. My manager even straight up lied to me that they were discussing this with leadership. I liked a lot of aspects about this job and this company at first, but it's clear to me that Arrow Electronics does not care about its employees and certainly does not see them as investments. HR also tells managers what scores they can rate their employees, because nobody is allowed to have too high a performance review score, which is highly unethical. It also looks like they zapped all jobs from their internal jobs board, so I suspect there are probably hiring freezes and potential layoffs on the table. This place is all talk, no substance. If you have choices, don't come here. This was easily the worst onboarding experience I have ever had. They gave me a few videos to watch as training to a pretty complex system, and then a week later (after I sent more than a few emails to them) my manager emailed me to ask if I was ready to get started with clients. Uh, no? Where is the rest of the training? Do I get any sort of administrative information (benefits, PTO, how to clock in and out, passwords for systems I need to access, etc.)? Is there more in-depth training on my actual duties, or opportunity to get paid with someone so I can train with them? No, apparently not. It also took me more than a month to even get confirmation of my actual start date and get my laptop from them. I had started to assume that they ghosted me, but apparently 4-6 business weeks is acceptable turnaround for communication about onboarding. The company culture is also atrocious--they keep everyone in their own little silos and refuse to engage in any sort of cross-team collaboration, even when it's necessary. They will also low-ball you at any given opportunity. At this point, their starting pay for most positions is nearing $20k under market value. Even when I was finishing up my time there, I sent email after email about returning my equipment to them, which obviously went unanswered. In the end, I think I just dropped it off in the lobby because I couldn't get any information from literally anyone in what to do with it. Most everyone who I knew there has since gone to a competitor company, where they treat their employees 100x better than Arrow. Unless you're desperate for a job, I would skip this mess of a company. They were a great company who once highly valued employees. As their political nature shifted at the highest levels, the company became less about valuing employees and providing the best service to the customers. Many people were fired due to vax mandate. The company has suffered greatly since they employed the mandates, and it has continued to go downhill even more since then. Friends told me they just had a new round of layoffs this week. Available positions are either swing or graveyard. There are very few chances of advancing. Supervisors on multiple occasions gave special favors to employees he performed favors outside of work. Some of the leads reward employees who stand around and talk with them instead of work, leaving others to pick up the slack. Medical benefits can be better, No vehicle allowances for sales role Low pay and not a lot of opportunity for raises or pay increases Shift work, counting No over time.Never enough time in the day to get it all done. Not always easy, everything specific to Arrow Revolving door company - talent comes and goes. Management's only focus is staying within budget - and there is not a lot of investment in branches. The company promotes ""5 Years Out,"" but they're about 10 years behind in management style. Senior management is stuck in the 9-5, Boomer mentality. Corporate marketing is based on Formula-1 and the word ""Arrow."" Despite no one knowing what Arrow does. Talent is exhausted and people quickly leave. Culture is non existent. If you go into the office, you're greeted by 7 floors of cold climate cubicles. If you're lucky enough for remote work, then it's not bad. The coffee is bad - made by a machine. There were snacks, not anymore. Budgeting and all, I guess. Oh, and no kudos for hard work. You're given more complex work. And no training either. You're shadowing someone anywhere from 4 days to a week, then sent to the wolves. Also, these people your shadowing are also stupid busy too. No formal training is there, since there's no process documents. If you can survive on 'no news is good news,' then you're in luck. Arrow has been pushing initiatives on career development and opportunities the past year, but I have not experienced any of this in my current department. I don't believe it's an earnest initiative on their part. There are also no known opportunities to cross train or learn from other departments. Everyone stays in their own silos and it's nearly impossible to branch out into other areas of interest. Arrow also seems to like to vastly underpay. In my case, it's around $20k under market easily. I have been seeking to rectify this situation with my management, but they have been doing everything possible to delay and avoid this discussion. My manager even straight up lied to me that they were discussing this with leadership. I liked a lot of aspects about this job and this company at first, but it's clear to me that Arrow Electronics does not care about its employees and certainly does not see them as investments. HR also tells managers what scores they can rate their employees, because nobody is allowed to have too high a performance review score, which is highly unethical. It also looks like they zapped all jobs from their internal jobs board, so I suspect there are probably hiring freezes and potential layoffs on the table. This place is all talk, no substance. If you have choices, don't come here. This was easily the worst onboarding experience I have ever had. They gave me a few videos to watch as training to a pretty complex system, and then a week later (after I sent more than a few emails to them) my manager emailed me to ask if I was ready to get started with clients. Uh, no? Where is the rest of the training? Do I get any sort of administrative information (benefits, PTO, how to clock in and out, passwords for systems I need to access, etc.)? Is there more in-depth training on my actual duties, or opportunity to get paid with someone so I can train with them? No, apparently not. It also took me more than a month to even get confirmation of my actual start date and get my laptop from them. I had started to assume that they ghosted me, but apparently 4-6 business weeks is acceptable turnaround for communication about onboarding. The company culture is also atrocious--they keep everyone in their own little silos and refuse to engage in any sort of cross-team collaboration, even when it's necessary. They will also low-ball you at any given opportunity. At this point, their starting pay for most positions is nearing $20k under market value.

Some of the leads reward employees who stand around and talk with them instead of work, leaving others to pick up the slack. Shift work, counting No over time. Marketing dollars available for conferences.Never enough time in the day to get it all done. Not always easy, everything specific to Arrow Revolving door company - talent comes and goes. Management's only focus is staying within budget - and there is not a lot of investment in branches. The company promotes ""5 Years Out,"" but they're about 10 years behind in management style. Senior management is stuck in the 9-5, Boomer mentality. Corporate marketing is based on Formula-1 and the word ""Arrow."" Despite no one knowing what Arrow does. Talent is exhausted and people quickly leave. Culture is non existent. If you go into the office, you're greeted by 7 floors of cold climate cubicles. If you're lucky enough for remote work, then it's not bad. The coffee is bad - made by a machine. There were snacks, not anymore. Budgeting and all, I guess. Oh, and no kudos for hard work. You're given more complex work. And no training either. You're shadowing someone anywhere from 4 days to a week, then sent to the wolves. Also, these people your shadowing are also stupid busy too. No formal training is there, since there's no process documents. If you can survive on 'no news is good news,' then you're in luck. Arrow has been pushing initiatives on career development and opportunities the past year, but I have not experienced any of this in my current department. I don't believe it's an earnest initiative on their part. There are also no known opportunities to cross train or learn from other departments. Everyone stays in their own silos and it's nearly impossible to branch out into other areas of interest. Arrow also seems to like to vastly underpay. In my case, it's around $20k under market easily. I have been seeking to rectify this situation with my management, but they have been doing everything possible to delay and avoid this discussion. My manager even straight up lied to me that they were discussing this with leadership. I liked a lot of aspects about this job and this company at first, but it's clear to me that Arrow Electronics does not care about its employees and certainly does not see them as investments. HR also tells managers what scores they can rate their employees, because nobody is allowed to have too high a performance review score, which is highly unethical. It also looks like they zapped all jobs from their internal jobs board, so I suspect there are probably hiring freezes and potential layoffs on the table. This place is all talk, no substance. If you have choices, don't come here. This was easily the worst onboarding experience I have ever had. They gave me a few videos to watch as training to a pretty complex system, and then a week later (after I sent more than a few emails to them) my manager emailed me to ask if I was ready to get started with clients. Uh, no? Where is the rest of the training? Do I get any sort of administrative information (benefits, PTO, how to clock in and out, passwords for systems I need to access, etc.)? Is there more in-depth training on my actual duties, or opportunity to get paid with someone so I can train with them? No, apparently not. It also took me more than a month to even get confirmation of my actual start date and get my laptop from them. I had started to assume that they ghosted me, but apparently 4-6 business weeks is acceptable turnaround for communication about onboarding. The company culture is also atrocious--they keep everyone in their own little silos and refuse to engage in any sort of cross-team collaboration, even when it's necessary. They will also low-ball you at any given opportunity. At this point, their starting pay for most positions is nearing $20k under market value. Even when I was finishing up my time there, I sent email after email about returning my equipment to them, which obviously went unanswered. In the end, I think I just dropped it off in the lobby because I couldn't get any information from literally anyone in what to do with it. Most everyone who I knew there has since gone to a competitor company, where they treat their employees 100x better than Arrow. Unless you're desperate for a job, I would skip this mess of a company. They were a great company who once highly valued employees. As their political nature shifted at the highest levels, the company became less about valuing employees and providing the best service to the customers. Many people were fired due to vax mandate. The company has suffered greatly since they employed the mandates, and it has continued to go downhill even more since then. Friends told me they just had a new round of layoffs this week.

Pay sucks and you'll never be able to pay bills working here. Low wages, lack of opportunity for growth and understaffed While working for G4S may offer access to consistent employment, it's important to consider some of the potential drawbacks associated with the company. One significant concern is the company's treatment of its employees. G4S has been known to exhibit poor management practices, including inadequate pay, insufficient staffing levels, and a tendency to overpromise and underdeliver on their commitments. This can result in a challenging work environment where employees may feel undervalued and unsupported. Additionally, the company's hiring practices often lead to understaffing, which can place additional burdens and stress on the existing workforce. These factors can contribute to decreased job satisfaction and a lack of work-life balance. It's crucial to carefully weigh the potential disadvantages of working for G4S, including the company's track record of poor treatment and insufficient support for their employees, before making a decision about employment. Supervisor have little or no experience Make promises they never plan to keep just to get you to agree to an assignment Will promise you a wage that's they know is wrong to get shifts filled Every site is a different contract meaning different pay grade Frequently supervised on sites by people who have far less experience Clients are lied to on staffing and the officers take the heat for it Good ethically strong employees take punishment for bad employees You will be sent to sites and given instructions for another site then being completely unprepared Frequently sent to sites in wrong uniform leaving officer to get wrath from client If you have an off time, it's not guaranteed. If someone calls off or doesn't show you will be stuck for up to 24 hours. ie: 12 hours shift and replacement no call no show.

I need this too use the site","Formerly, there was a concern in direction - but with the new CEO named, we look forward to a clearer picture of future trajectory and focus. Company had frequent layoffs, almost every year since 2015. At face they would pretend to have measures such as employee retention and DE&I B.S., but at the end of the day the company supports favoritism over merit. Yes you get rewarded for being a “yes man” . People at leadership level have no clue or long term strategy which is evident from the fact that they end up laying off people every year because they are playing the trail and error game. People are more concerned and are in constant fear as to who would get laid off in next round/ year and that defines the work rather than what’s actually needed to be worked. After a series of unfortunate circumstances you could tell that the focus shifted from people taking care of people to recovering lost revenue even if it was at the expense of the people. The climate is stifling with lots of micromanagement. There are so many levels of leadership with no one making real decisions. It feels that they are trying to make people so uncomfortable that they leave on their own so that they do not have to have yet another layoff. There were 3 layoffs in under 3 months and leading up to them there were leaders calling other companies trying to sabotage people's transitions if they found out where people were going. Morale is at an all time low. Lean groups are looking at losing more talent that they can ill afford all while being told to deliver the same level of work. Company has ups and downs and has struggled recently Biogen used to be focused on helping patients, but ever since Chris Viehbacher took over the focus is all on money. We've started a ""Fit for Growth"" program that seems focused on making investors happy at the expense of patients and employees, and looking at our stock price right now we can't even do that. Communication is mostly ominous these days and gives me almost no faith that this place is going to be somewhere that people want to work moving forward, assuming the manufacturing plant isn't spun off or sold entirely. Where to start? The fact that there is a HUGE disconnect between management and employees such as management thinking that slashing the workforce is a development opportunity for those that remain. How about the fact that there is clear favoritism in the company which is why people who should have been fired because they are toxic and ineffective were instead saved and now have the opportunity to be leaders again. We can touch on the terrible communication of leadership regarding layoffs which they decided to do by sending cryptic emails at 4am EST to people about ""updates to the organization"". Let's touch on the completely siloed functions within the same organization and how they all do the same work completely differently (I'm looking at you Quality). I think my personal favorite is the fact that everyone passes the buck on what their work, thus making it someone else's responsibility to clean up their mess. Overall, if you have suffered burnout or are going through burnout, don't come to Biogen. It's terrible here and the positive reviews were most likely paid for or posted by HR in an effort to get talent as even new hires are leaving after 1-2 years. Biogen can't retain its talent and is laying off the rest. Just avoid at all costs. There wasn’t much activity given throughout internship. Depending on the department, management can be very difficult to deal with. Worked in multiple departments- some were pretty good, some were horrible. Went to HR and they couldn’t care less. Filed a case with irrefutable documentation - it was reviewed and completely dismissed.Formerly, there was a concern in direction - but with the new CEO named, we look forward to a clearer picture of future trajectory and focus.

Price for medical insurance could be better, but that’s everywhere. Company goals were not achievable for the mass majority of offices. If your branch had a good month the goals were raised higher regardless of the current market. Commission pay percentages were paid consecutively lower each year. A majority of customers struggle to pay off their loans and/or make on time payments. When they finally paid off their loan, management pushed to solicit immediately for another loan. Which greatly impacted branch revenue, collections goals, and customer relationships. Needless to say in most markets earnings commission is almost unachievable. Constantly calling the same current/former customers to solicit loans and/payments. Constant Customer feedback was OMF called too much and sent too much mail. Many customers request to be DO NOT CONTACT. Lack of bonus payout / low base pay for while upper management executives continue to get paid millions. The company routinely boats healthy quarterly profits while not paying hard working employees a living wage. Sad to say, several of my team members work a second job to make ends meet……This use to be great company to work for, but corporate mentality changed from taking care of the employees they in turn will take care of your customer to : only care about shareholders and profits. Your bonus monthly is solely dependent on you collecting payments from customers with poor credit. Around the time covid hit a lot of customers started to default and as a result the bonuses dried up. This wouldn’t be an issue if the base pay was fair but it’s not you can’t live on that alone. Upper management routinely cascades the message down to recruiting that a lot of team members make up pay with our very lucrative bonus structure. Not true anymore. The company is hemorrhaging seasoned team members and can’t seem to figure out why ? It’s the pay or lack there of that couples with the sense that corporate officers could truly care less about their workers on the front line. I think I speak for everyone at the company when I say year end raises at .10 to .40 cents / hr is just insulting. Only so far you can go before your salary is capped; KPIs are based on branch and district performance, not only individual metrics, which can hurt your ability to earn a bonus. It’s something new in the policy that will change faithfully you just have to stay ready. Management is horrible and has no idea how to run a team or district. Definitely is a good old boys club. If you are not part of the yes man click or good old boy club this is not the job for you. Bullying happened, employees were threated, vacations cancelled. .If you call out sick be prepared to be judge and asked all about why. Plus they will tell everyone why your out including medical personal information. The worst experience I have ever had at a job. The pay is not that great either, underpaid for what you have to do were employees are fudging apps to get them founded. It's sad. This could be a really good company if they cared more about the employees and HR did their job. Turn over is so bad. No one stays a year. Management will yell, curse, talk badly about customers and employees in front of everyone. Doesn't matter if customers are in office. Everyone can do whatever they want. It's actually disgusting on how unprofessional this company is. If you have a manager who lacks leadership, you will not be motivated for long, not have constructive feedback or consistent support. Branch Managers are left to do as they wish. Very goal driven business. You'll work more than you expect if you're in a busy branch. You do not have enough time in the day to think things over or properly prepare. My experience has been in a very busy branch, lower volume branches with strong leaders probably yield a much more positive experience. The learning process at the beginning is very rushed and overwhelming. They pay could be better. It's not unless you want to be a branch manager the pay won't be that great.

The flexibility is fabulous and the management are totally awesome 🤩 Pro grade of live kho mi very good and committed people Great colleagues and learning opportunities Learned that I never want to work for an insurance company where they pride themselves on just teaching new hires to sell their propriety products to their friends and family… great place to work in france Great benefits, they offer 4 weeks PTO starting on day 1, they have paid holidays, they also have dental, medical, vision insurance. If you work the holidays you get almost triple paid, they offer a wellness program where you get reimbursed $100 back for gym membership, management can be flexible sometimes with the schedules, they would hardly ever deny my PTO.

As a post-doc, I have been unable to do many things at the University as I am considered and not considered staff, faculty, or a student based on no known metric. As such, when I go to different organizations (transportation, health, benefits services...), no one knows how to treat me and I often do not get any service as I don't fit into any of their categories. As a place with hundreds of post-docs I expected better. Additionally, I started after my defense but before my official diploma arrived (which in normal for post-docs) but the University would not hire me for the first month and did not tell me this until after I had arrived. I wish they had let me know before my start date so I could get my thesis formatting review prioritized in their system. The big elephant in the room when it comes to the Job is the pay ($11/hr) it is less than all the other pools in the area witch pay $14-$15/hr. There is also no room for growth in the pay since it is a university job. the main issue I and some of my other coworkers have is the management wile most of the full time staff (pro staff) is great there are some outliers that seem to drive the staff crazy and do not seem to do what they need to do and whenever they promise stuff its not usually delivered on and whenever they come down to where the lifeguards are they usually just sit on there phone and don't seem to be in anyway helpful and more times than not are just bothersome. Poor Pay with few opportunities for advancement. The raises are awful. They won't negotiate starting pay with merit staff regardless of previous experience. The cost of health insurance is steadily increasing. They're no longer the best employer in the area. If you plan on having children while working here, don't. Short-term disability is not offered. By the end of maternity leave, it's likely that you will use up all of your sick and vacation time...which, if you haven't been working here for 10 years then you end up unpaid. The kicker is when you come back to work and your child goes to daycare, they are likely going to get sick. You don't have any time to take off so THEN HR has the nerve to contact about taking too much time off. Maybe if you offered some sort of paid maternity leave like MANY states, then this would not be an issue. If you plan on adopting...you only get 1 week to bond with your new baby. How insensitive is that? Babies cannot even start daycare until 6 weeks usually. The incompetence is unreal. They are really rude too. People are too concerned about politics, they make it their entire personality - Not a lot of paid positions for student researchers - The pay is below average for how much work is expected of you. Do not expect pay increases greater than 2% per year. There are years where you'll receive 1% or less. - Your job will accumulate more responsibilities than what you're being paid for. - The pay disparity between most employees and senior staff/directors is massive. Expect to make less than $60k/yr as a senior employee with 1% raises every year while your boss makes well over $125k. - If you're looking for career advancement, this is not the place for you. Promotions do not happen here. - The majority of staff are over 45 years old. If you're young, expect to be in a very small minority and thus, not taken as seriously as older employees. - A lot of work seems to be generated for the sake of it. People at the UI are rewarded for looking busy by contributing work that has very little value - Iowa is now controlled by a far-right, anti-education conservative legislature. Do not expect raises or budgets, and I would go so far as to say everyone should always be worried about the next budget from the Board of Regents and how it will be interpreted by the shot-callers at the university. The graduate students are not so good. You have to well train them for quite a long time before they can assistant you on research.None that I encountered in my time!

It could be varying by department and college. The raises are awful. They won't negotiate starting pay with merit staff regardless of previous experience. The cost of health insurance is steadily increasing. They're no longer the best employer in the area.None that I encountered in my time! As a post-doc, I have been unable to do many things at the University as I am considered and not considered staff, faculty, or a student based on no known metric. As such, when I go to different organizations (transportation, health, benefits services...), no one knows how to treat me and I often do not get any service as I don't fit into any of their categories. As a place with hundreds of post-docs I expected better. Additionally, I started after my defense but before my official diploma arrived (which in normal for post-docs) but the University would not hire me for the first month and did not tell me this until after I had arrived. I wish they had let me know before my start date so I could get my thesis formatting review prioritized in their system.

Poor Pay with few opportunities for advancement. The raises are awful. They won't negotiate starting pay with merit staff regardless of previous experience. The cost of health insurance is steadily increasing. They're no longer the best employer in the area. If you plan on having children while working here, don't. Short-term disability is not offered. By the end of maternity leave, it's likely that you will use up all of your sick and vacation time...which, if you haven't been working here for 10 years then you end up unpaid. The kicker is when you come back to work and your child goes to daycare, they are likely going to get sick. You don't have any time to take off so THEN HR has the nerve to contact about taking too much time off. Maybe if you offered some sort of paid maternity leave like MANY states, then this would not be an issue. If you plan on adopting...you only get 1 week to bond with your new baby. How insensitive is that? Babies cannot even start daycare until 6 weeks usually. The incompetence is unreal. They are really rude too. People are too concerned about politics, they make it their entire personality - Not a lot of paid positions for student researchers - The pay is below average for how much work is expected of you. Do not expect pay increases greater than 2% per year. There are years where you'll receive 1% or less. - Your job will accumulate more responsibilities than what you're being paid for. - The pay disparity between most employees and senior staff/directors is massive. Expect to make less than $60k/yr as a senior employee with 1% raises every year while your boss makes well over $125k. - If you're looking for career advancement, this is not the place for you. Promotions do not happen here. - The majority of staff are over 45 years old. If you're young, expect to be in a very small minority and thus, not taken as seriously as older employees. - A lot of work seems to be generated for the sake of it. People at the UI are rewarded for looking busy by contributing work that has very little value - Iowa is now controlled by a far-right, anti-education conservative legislature. Do not expect raises or budgets, and I would go so far as to say everyone should always be worried about the next budget from the Board of Regents and how it will be interpreted by the shot-callers at the university. The graduate students are not so good. You have to well train them for quite a long time before they can assistant you on research.None that I encountered in my time!
