Lack of respect from nurses and doctors and the job that environmental services technicians do. Mid-level leadership outside of clinical departments can be flaky, chaotic, indecisive and childish. Hard to grow. Most ppl are aware it’s easier to get a job elsewhere and come back than get promotions in own department I can't think of nothing The hospital is great, the research institute is another story. In fact, it is a total dumpster fire. For as good as the hospital's leadership is, the research institute leadership is terrible. The CEO is a snake oil salesman control freak and the directors are members in his cult of personality. The people who actually do the work are overworked, under resourced, and micromanaged like crazy. They love to talk about how great and values-focused they are but it is all talk. Superstar docs get whatever they want and anyone else gets thrown under the bus to make sure the gravy train keeps rolling. They've had major turnover problems and there shouldn't be any mystery why. No consequences for the obviously inept leadership though, just band aids and spin. Their reputation is garbage outside of Houston because the horror stories, waste and low standards are no longer much of a secret. Some day soon all the chickens will come home to roost and you'll not want to be at Houston Methodist Research Institute when they do.Nursing will always have the same cons, however this employer really makes a difference.

It's a great company.. Managers have had to argue for employee increases w/opposition from Managers from complete other teams, behind closed doors for some of the most productive on their team with the highest numbers because of politics. Not too organized, lack of documentation for processes, some team members don't get themselves adequate work-life balance How each business unit is ran as its own business so the messaging and business strategy as a whole is a bit confusing. Divisions are going against each other to sell their product so it is survival of the fittest. Hours can be demanding and it is a very competitive atmosphere. Constantly learning! Which is definitely a pro but if you want a job that you’ll just coast in this isn’t it Sr BA is a bully that would constantly make comments about team members personal lives, race, and weight. People shouldn’t work the same jobs for almost twenty years if this is what they get like. The lack of professionalism made work difficult to achieve especially if you needed a resource or supply from her because then she would complain about you bugging her. We were supposed to receive water bottles our first week bc they are the only ones allowed in the warehouse and it almost took two months and then she was inconvenienced when asked about this even though access to water during work shouldn’t be such a hard thing. This kind of attitude was the same when going to her with equipment issues or needing box cutters and such. The supervisor that would do interviews was very picky about candidates and would state that it wasn’t because of something that sound rude but would list reasons that were judgemental and discriminatory (something related to background, physical appearance, etc) The thing these two had in common was that they were very forgetful bc these things were said with other people in the room almost like they’d forget that they’d brought someone up for training and forgot they could be heard. If you’re considering a product management job at Medline, look elsewhere. Medline has a very toxic work culture. They demand your full day of non stop work. The teams are consistently understaffed and you are expected to constantly work late to take on the extra work. There is no work/life balance at this company. So much so I have heard a Division VP say that to succeed at this company you need to “give up other parts of your life”. They will keep you at a lower pay/position as long as they possibly can and only promote you once they feel forced to do so. The only way to get promoted quickly is to know someone in upper management or be a family member of someone in upper management. The company consistently puts making just a little bit more in profits over making their employees lives better. Management is also very out of touch with lower employees. Every manager at this company has dedicated their life to Medline and expects each employee to do the same at the expense of a work/life balance. Most teams/product divisions don’t hit the 10% bonus that are based on product performance/sales since they often set highly unrealistic goals. There is very high turnover at Medline and it is not surprising at all why. Avoid this company if you want to be happy in life.

I worked at the HQ in Northfield. The director only promotes white people and it isn’t based off performance but rather if they like you or not. I saw a person that would call in sick every day because they were too drunk to go in get promoted to manager even though they didn’t meet their bonus requirements. There are way more qualified people to do the job but he was picked because the director knows his mom.

Good benefits Culture The work is rewarding","Long hours sometimes but balanced with time off and benefits. Cross organizational communication. Earned Value is where dreams go to die. This job was rough from the start, and featured a complete lack of training to do the job. Management is weirdly proud of being as obtuse as possible and takes pride in the fact that there is no support system to get new hires up to speed. The team takes pride in how many hours they sacrifice in the name of P and W, but doesn't care at all if you've accomplished anything in that time. You will hear the term ""Drinking from a Firehose"" used atleast once a day to justify how awful the job is. It's mind numbingly boring with a hint of sourness and stress 5 days a week & 9 hours a day. Don't do it. Just don't. Work life balance could be better Insane volume of work, a lot of busy work and parent company drama. Noone gets promoted. New people may find it difficult to find information stored in many different software systems. Not sure how I feel about building fighter jet engines for RTX. There are some culture changes that need to be made. No growth, antiquated management, amiguismo Although the company works on cutting-edge technologies, I feel that there is a lack of innovation and creativity in the day-to-day work. The work environment is too conservative and risk-averse. Hybrid is the standard now but some elements in management are clearly pushing for more presence in the office. This is unfortunate considering a lot of jobs can be performed perfectly well on a mostly remote basis.

Work life balance could be better New people may find it difficult to find information stored in many different software systems. Not sure how I feel about building fighter jet engines for RTX. There are some culture changes that need to be made. No growth, antiquated management, amiguismo Although the company works on cutting-edge technologies, I feel that there is a lack of innovation and creativity in the day-to-day work. The work environment is too conservative and risk-averse. Hybrid is the standard now but some elements in management are clearly pushing for more presence in the office. This is unfortunate considering a lot of jobs can be performed perfectly well on a mostly remote basis. This would help out tremendously since decent housing without a killer commute in very hard to come by here in PR. Organization structure is not lean Typically overworked With hybrid and being so large can get lost or pigeon holed and difficult to differentiate your capabilities. Easy to get sucked in and over-perform yet get no recognition or opportunities.Long hours sometimes but balanced with time off and benefits. Cross organizational communication. Earned Value is where dreams go to die. This job was rough from the start, and featured a complete lack of training to do the job. Management is weirdly proud of being as obtuse as possible and takes pride in the fact that there is no support system to get new hires up to speed. The team takes pride in how many hours they sacrifice in the name of P and W, but doesn't care at all if you've accomplished anything in that time.

If someone calls in you’re forced to stay over to cover and if you do not they tell you it’s “job abandonment” and threaten to fire you. If you work 2nd shift and there’s someone on vacation on the 3rd shift you are REQUIRED to come in Sunday night at 11pm because that’s when 3rds shift week starts. You’re given the option to become a lead then when you have your interview told you need to learn running more machines but, then replace you a guy that’s never touched a machine before because favoritism is common. Your work is never appreciated you more likely to actually be told about your quality issues rather than any sort of recognition for the hard work you put in. You work In the hot warehouse all day. There’s too many cons for this place. I wouldn’t tell my worst enemy to apply here. Worst job I ever worked at. - The corporate culture is quite negative and toxic. With many in upper leadership that have never worked outside of the packaging industry, there's a constant battle between the ""old guard"" and the new, younger workforce. - The corporate culture at WestRock is heavily favoritism-based. Unpopular decisions will be escalated to upper management at the drop of a pin. - ""Flexible"" in-office days are a lie - they expect you to be at your desk 3-4 days minimum, from 9-5. No real incentives to return to the office - just punishment if you don't. Senior management walks the floors to ensure workers are at their desks. - Executive team doesn't appear to have a plan outside of closing facilities. Forced to work too much overtime. Some weeks are 12 hours everyday for 6 days adding up to a 72 hour work week. That's too much. Forced to work every other Saturday for 8 hours and management is trying to make it every Saturday again No work life balance, production over everything, no accountability from management always passing the buck ""its corporates fault, its the HR managers fault, Its payrolls fault, its engineering's fault, its the unions fault..."" and on and on and on. This company is ran horribly. In the 5 years I was there westrock changed management across the board multiple times. There is no continuity. They bring in outsiders with no clue how to run things.
