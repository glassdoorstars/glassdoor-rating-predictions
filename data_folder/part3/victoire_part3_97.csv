Still recovering from COVID staffing shortages Dealing with christo-fascists on a regular basis. Stigma against working with/for a company who is anti-abortion Can be disorganized/low number of support Leadership has some major, major problems. I loved my job and would have stayed forever if it wasn't such a toxic work culture. Upper management were all white women and whenever issues of microaggressions and racism were raised, white woman tears would ensue without any actual action taken to make the workplace feel more inclusive. Some coworkers really tried to do our job and education internally, but the education department was ultimately considered the ""problem"" instead of any actual accountability taking place. Reproductive justice work is HARD, and this work culture only made it harder. There are also limited chances for upward movement unless leadership decides they like you. Too many egos standing in the way of real progress. Constant staffing issues in some departments. Equity is pushed more than practiced on some teams. Workload never decreases no matter how much you get done. Politics: what seems ""professional"" is just passive aggressive and sometimes counterproductive. Administration is clueless and abusive. Limited staffing resources. This particular affiliate could not keep medical assistants and constantly ran with bare-boned centers. Staff were constantly ""offered to work"" at different medical centers around the states to cover staffing shortages, which meant hours of travel between centers, unreliable work schedules, higher than average call-offs, and ultimately, inability to serve patients effectively. I think the affiliate was in the process of rebuilding because it was very chaotic and felt all over the place all of the time. Asked a lot of front line workers without compensating them. Poor morale. Bad management, toxic culture, gaslighting, shifting goalposts I never felt at home. Felt unsupported and unclear about my role. I was gently let go a few years later and have never been happier. The schedule is grueling and there is no autonomy. Every single thing is under a microscope (which from a liability perspective you can understand, but it feels SO much better to be at a job where you have some creative freedom and trust). The schedule is tightly micro-managed even for managers.--30 minute breaks and your time is managed to the minute BUT you WILL work overtime, and if that infringes on your personal time, too bad. You are 1000% expected to BE the job. I could never totally clock out. To be fair. these workers NEED a manager who is available 24/7/365 but I could never be that person. There are a huge # of callouts and turnover because the organization will not adjust things to make the job sustainable for people. Then, you cannot really hold people accountable, having to jump through a bunch of hoops just to send an email sometimes. It was exhausting. All this aside, I do believe most of the people were there because they truly cared about public health and they worked their tushies off to take care of people. Poor wages, expect you to part-take in on the job training without increasing staff wages, fully book the daily schedule even when short staffed, always expect you to be moving efficiently but don't give you adequate staffing or time between scheduled appointments, make you lie to patients about wait times being due to short staffing when in reality clinicians have long visits and we are over bookedStaffing.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Emory-Healthcare-Reviews-E19564.htm,"You will be recognized for the work you do, when you do it well. company appreciation events company reputation (big name) remote opportunity (after training) very nice administrative facility off major holidays Weekend and holidays off. Start earning PTO early The best company I've ever worked for fast paced, good workers and nice patients It’s a job, I guess. Decent pay Good PTO Great staff to work with Easy scheduling - Amazing coworkers - Complex patients The company amazing culture and people are super nice. Fairly short commute A/C & Heat works Some coworkers are really nice","Making change sometimes is like moving an elephant. They don’t do paid holidays (you have to have the PTO available) or you’ll be short a day on your paycheck. Extremely low pay for a huge workload Micromanagement- THIS IS A BIG ISSUE Managers don’t have a clue on anything so don’t ask - they are just told to babysit you. You have to wait a year before they even add to your 401K There is no formal training, you just sit next to someone and teach yourself. They make a simple job extremely complicated. It could all be so simple. Behind on all technology Unnecessary high call volume They are driving customers away with their horrible planning and marketing issues Managers consistently change what they say and confuse you as well as themselves Overworked and underpaid. No clear job descriptions I personally do not really have any cons poor management, high turnover rate for most admin positions Pays far lower than competitors Acts like you can pay bills with the Emory name Extremely liberal Forces university views on healthcare employees High patient volume, patient and staff safety concerns Lack of communication and support from management Adding more hoops from advancement and pay increases - Poor pay compared to surrounding facilities - Poor PTO However, it has no work life balance You have to fake like you care about the patients and be overly communicative which can be repetitive and very annoying. Not enough pay for the amount of work and stress we deal with. (33k a yr specifically) Environment (patients included) is overly serious, which is understandable since it’s people’s health but this can drag you down after a while. If you’re more of a straight forward business oriented person that doesn’t really care about people’s health, I would not recommend this position."

If a project led by an IC is slipping by a week, management make a big fuss about it and expect a mitigation plan ASAP. But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager. - Abysmal work/life balance - Disjointed collaboration efforts (especially between regions) - Lack of high level transparency - Regularly shifting key objectives - Single point of failure is a regular occurrence - Recent economic downturn has caused some thrashing with the company is a state of continual re-orgs - Perhaps grew too fast during covid. - There is way less emphasis on the company values and people's mental health - inexperience executives resulting in indecisiveness - indecisiveness results in constant change where all things work are unclear - new executives from Meta and Microsoft implementing big tech practices- no fresh thinking; just replicating the same stuff - company is starting to look like an old, stodgy tech company- losing it's innovative, competitive edge - pressured to do more yet work deliverables and priorities are constantly changing- everyone is tired- change fatigue I want to start by saying I am not bitter or angry. Working for Atlassian was a whirlwind. I was there for 11 months before being laid off via email. In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt. Place has become toxic lately with everyone fearful of their jobs , stressed and overworked.the famed Atlassian values are no longer a thing - It's just another tool for management to use against you. Management has been given new pip targets by new leadership. So although there are no public layoffs(at least for now), silent layoffs continue to happen on the quiet. People are being managed out or are being put on PIP to avoid severance. This is barely a year after the founders had provided a target to double the headcount from 12k to 24k. People are actively colluding to setup co workers. Stack ranking is a thing where employees within a leaders org are being stack ranked. Managers are deliberately misguiding employees in 1:1's and setting them up for failure or giving them unreasonable targets so that they fail. There are many which I figured out in my 2 year tenure. - An org. building project management/agile software like Jira does not utilize Jira well. Their processes are terribly bad and unclear. - Atlassian Real Values: Blame game, people pleasing, demotivation, Negative mindset, Politics and bring people down to climb up the ladder. - As managers create an empire of senior engineers irrespective of whether they have work or not to grow. - You will be judged based on failures only which might not be even relevant. - Arrogance in managers, juniors or new members are treated badly. - Actually nobody cares about how employees feel. There are internal employee surveys but feedback is not taken into account. Leadership will do whatever pleases them. - Avoid Data Portability team. Hell load of work, frequently changing expectations and pressure to meet deadline. Majority of the work do not even have any significant impact. Join at your own risk. However, amidst the impressive commitment to values, the company's rapid expansion and the shift from on-premise to cloud-based services has been far from seamless. This has somewhat dampened my confidence in the company's future and its capacity to effectively function at larger scales. As company grows, it is getting more and more matrixed and difficult to navigate/get things done.- Nothing, one of the best places I've ever worked for - At this stage, the company values have turned into a meme, just like the concept of ""Playing As A Team"" and stack ranking. - Accountability only works downwards.

I've been with the company for more than 5 years and have seen lots of changes. This last year had more changes than the last 5 together. Some of the changes are good in isolation but together they are creating a toxic environment. 3 years ago one of the founders said it was ok to have an ""off year"" and people wouldn't be judged for that. This year they introduced stack ranking and are asking senior employees to rank their less senior colleagues. 3 years ago they decided engineers had to focus on feature leading and managers on people leadership. This year they are making non technical managers redundant. I always heard from the founders that shareholder pressure wouldn't drive the company. It looks like it does now. We are blindly following with other companies are doing due to pressure from the board. Stock price took a big dive so maybe there's lots of upside if you only care about the money. Do your own DD.

Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt. Place has become toxic lately with everyone fearful of their jobs , stressed and overworked.the famed Atlassian values are no longer a thing - It's just another tool for management to use against you. Management has been given new pip targets by new leadership. So although there are no public layoffs(at least for now), silent layoffs continue to happen on the quiet. People are being managed out or are being put on PIP to avoid severance. This is barely a year after the founders had provided a target to double the headcount from 12k to 24k. People are actively colluding to setup co workers. Stack ranking is a thing where employees within a leaders org are being stack ranked. Managers are deliberately misguiding employees in 1:1's and setting them up for failure or giving them unreasonable targets so that they fail. There are many which I figured out in my 2 year tenure. - An org. building project management/agile software like Jira does not utilize Jira well. Their processes are terribly bad and unclear. - Atlassian Real Values: Blame game, people pleasing, demotivation, Negative mindset, Politics and bring people down to climb up the ladder. - As managers create an empire of senior engineers irrespective of whether they have work or not to grow. - You will be judged based on failures only which might not be even relevant. - Arrogance in managers, juniors or new members are treated badly. - Actually nobody cares about how employees feel. There are internal employee surveys but feedback is not taken into account. Leadership will do whatever pleases them. - Avoid Data Portability team. Hell load of work, frequently changing expectations and pressure to meet deadline. Majority of the work do not even have any significant impact. Join at your own risk. However, amidst the impressive commitment to values, the company's rapid expansion and the shift from on-premise to cloud-based services has been far from seamless. This has somewhat dampened my confidence in the company's future and its capacity to effectively function at larger scales. As company grows, it is getting more and more matrixed and difficult to navigate/get things done.- Nothing, one of the best places I've ever worked for - At this stage, the company values have turned into a meme, just like the concept of ""Playing As A Team"" and stack ranking. - Accountability only works downwards. If a project led by an IC is slipping by a week, management make a big fuss about it and expect a mitigation plan ASAP. But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager. - Abysmal work/life balance - Disjointed collaboration efforts (especially between regions) - Lack of high level transparency - Regularly shifting key objectives - Single point of failure is a regular occurrence - Recent economic downturn has caused some thrashing with the company is a state of continual re-orgs - Perhaps grew too fast during covid. - There is way less emphasis on the company values and people's mental health - inexperience executives resulting in indecisiveness - indecisiveness results in constant change where all things work are unclear - new executives from Meta and Microsoft implementing big tech practices- no fresh thinking; just replicating the same stuff - company is starting to look like an old, stodgy tech company- losing it's innovative, competitive edge - pressured to do more yet work deliverables and priorities are constantly changing- everyone is tired- change fatigue I want to start by saying I am not bitter or angry.

I've been with the company for more than 5 years and have seen lots of changes. This last year had more changes than the last 5 together. Some of the changes are good in isolation but together they are creating a toxic environment. 3 years ago one of the founders said it was ok to have an ""off year"" and people wouldn't be judged for that. This year they introduced stack ranking and are asking senior employees to rank their less senior colleagues. 3 years ago they decided engineers had to focus on feature leading and managers on people leadership. This year they are making non technical managers redundant. I always heard from the founders that shareholder pressure wouldn't drive the company. It looks like it does now. We are blindly following with other companies are doing due to pressure from the board. Stock price took a big dive so maybe there's lots of upside if you only care about the money. Do your own DD.

This has somewhat dampened my confidence in the company's future and its capacity to effectively function at larger scales. As company grows, it is getting more and more matrixed and difficult to navigate/get things done."

Great benefit if you have been there for more than 10 years","I do not have any cons. (Trivium) A brand new building, terminated people after WEEKS of giving false hopes that employees would still have a job. Corning didn't allow us to cash in our PTO or Vacation time. They simply just terminated half of us, though they did allow the servance pay (a month of your regular check). They ""randomly"" selected people to terminate, but even good hard workers of 2-8 years were terminated. They didn't even allow thos workers to be moved to other locations. Very disappointing. Competitors, such as Comscope, has had remarkable communications with THEIR employees. Allowing their workers to know the truth. Favoritism, willing to sacrifice benefits to employees in tough times, low levels of support from management for their workers Location, location, location - depending upon your life situation. Big ideas and aspirations but lacks commitment in systems funding to bring the enterprise to the next-level. Hiring in inexperienced Managers for their job titles. Constantly being told that business will pick up but it's not. Uncertainty of any additional layoffs in Q4. There were significant layoffs at the end of Q2. Politics talks in this company. Rarely any project out of thousand projects made money during at least 15 years of the work. People sustain there by pleasing upper management. So, extremely bad culture with non competent managers in the R&D division. Sometimes the workload can be overwhelming. Layoffs, Downsizing in decreased production supply periods Nothing was wrong. I had an injury to my wrist. They had to let me go Terrible pay raises - over time, inflation will out pace the 2% annual raises. office politics galore, Each employee is ranked by managers before the annual Performance development reviews even start.. the only way to progress is to get in tight with the right manager. Unfortunately for you, there’s already a line of employees cuddled up to the right managers, effectively creating a protected class.I do not have any cons.

Sometimes you can get put on projects and stuck there due to staffing shortages -Projects can tend to be strung out and it's easy to get set in a very niche role - travel (pre-Covid was 90%) may be less now - low salary compared to market Salary could be more competitive.

I liked stability and salary :)","Low salaries, a lot of promises - no actions, unfortunately senior management is focused only on revenue but not people and keen to take advantage of selling young perspective professionals as per higher rate but not paying them fair salary. Employees salaries haven't been recalculated per changed interest rate as well. There is no visibility on Bands&Grades system and almost a year they keep saying they are working on it. So professionals have no clue how they could grow in the company as well as if their skillset was estimated correctly. All of the above was repeatedly raised with line and senior management however no actions from their side just ""we are looking into this"". I will say about the recruitment process. Some of the HR executives here are worse. They have the power to make a candidate move to next round. But they are thinking that they are the bosses of the company. They have the low quality qualification and they are rejecting good highly qualified candidates by using their ill brain. I don't know what's wrong in their head. It's high time for companies to hire good HR's otherwise they will use their ill brain and spoil the company. Hiring of HR's should be strict because first step of recruitment is in their hands and candidates future is ruined by these people who don't have any understanding. Candidate comes to interview with high hopes but these idiots ruin their career. Your hard work doesn't matter to them. Their pathetic decision matters to company. Worst HR here (Not everyone but some are there for sure). They know whom they should hire. Rest brain of pathetic HR executive is responsible for the recruitment. Advice: If you feel you are the deserving candidate and they reject you then don't feel sad. Instead work hard and reach a good position. Don't waste your precious time. Limited Growth Opportunities: Depending on the project and team, there might be limitations on upward career mobility or opportunities for advancement, which could be frustrating for ambitious developers looking to climb the corporate ladder. Bureaucracy: As the company grows, there might be an increase in bureaucratic processes and decision-making hierarchies, which could slow down the implementation of ideas and innovation. Project Instability: The nature of client-based projects can lead to uncertainty in terms of project stability and continuity. Projects could end abruptly or transition to new clients, potentially affecting job security and long-term planning. Workload Fluctuations: While work-life balance is a focus, certain projects or deadlines might lead to periods of increased workload and stress, impacting the promised balance. Communication Challenges: Being a global company, communication across different time zones and cultures can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or delays in decision-making. Salary Competitiveness: While GlobalLogic is known for its positive work environment, salary competitiveness might vary depending on the role, location, and industry standards. Technology Stack Variability: The technology stack used for projects could vary, which might not align with the individual developer's preferences or long-term career goals. Remote Work Isolation: While remote work is supported, some employees might experience isolation or a lack of connection with colleagues, especially if they are not on-site regularly. Training and Development Gaps: While GlobalLogic encourages continuous learning, the availability of training resources and the extent of skill development support might vary across teams. Client Pressure: Working closely with clients could lead to additional pressure to meet client expectations and demands, potentially affecting work-life balance during critical project phases. They provide Very less package Not such as of now Things differ from project to project. No job security once your Project is over especially if you are in North America with Green Card/citizenship, they fire you in 1 week. However, for employees who are are with closed work permit (i.e. their Visa status allows them to work only for GlobalLogic) can stay on bench without work for 1 year plus. Hypocrisy and discrimination at the best Nothing so far, It was good working They have a more man power but lees projects. so making a bench hot is not a good sighn But you wants to financially grow, you have to change the company.

Low salaries, a lot of promises - no actions, unfortunately senior management is focused only on revenue but not people and keen to take advantage of selling young perspective professionals as per higher rate but not paying them fair salary.

All of the above was repeatedly raised with line and senior management however no actions from their side just ""we are looking into this"". I will say about the recruitment process. Some of the HR executives here are worse. They have the power to make a candidate move to next round. But they are thinking that they are the bosses of the company. They have the low quality qualification and they are rejecting good highly qualified candidates by using their ill brain. I don't know what's wrong in their head. It's high time for companies to hire good HR's otherwise they will use their ill brain and spoil the company. Hiring of HR's should be strict because first step of recruitment is in their hands and candidates future is ruined by these people who don't have any understanding. Candidate comes to interview with high hopes but these idiots ruin their career. Your hard work doesn't matter to them. Their pathetic decision matters to company. Worst HR here (Not everyone but some are there for sure). They know whom they should hire. Rest brain of pathetic HR executive is responsible for the recruitment. Advice: If you feel you are the deserving candidate and they reject you then don't feel sad. Instead work hard and reach a good position. Don't waste your precious time.

The work life balance would not be ideal for a person looking for a 40 hour work week would not recommend any process engineering roles at this organization. The haphazard attitude of management in the 3D-NAND deposition group is only compensated for by their dishonesty and lack of accountability. This has led to half of the group leaving; including people at the director level. Furthermore, there is a severe lack of safety: in late-January Lam sent a group of engineers to China during the viral outbreak. Management claims they were not aware of this outbreak when they sent people, but all of the Chinese-based Lam employees knew about it. Bringing up this fact to management and HR gets no response. Additionally, on the same day the US cancelled all flights to China due to the coronavirus, one of the US-based employees, who returned two days earlier from China, was told they should have stayed. This employee was also not informed to quarantine despite asking management earlier, because, at the time of the outbreak, Lam was not aware this employee went China. How can Lam not account for the very employees they ask to travel? Again, management and HR have no answer. Work/life balance is awful and not recognized. Constant last minute changes with very little time to react. If the pay and benefits hadn’t been as good as they were I would have been looking elsewhere before the layoffs. It was getting to the point that even with the benefits, the lack of work/life balance was unsustainable. Lack of automation and complex work being done on Excel spreadsheets was completely inefficient and reduced already constrained time. After months of late nights reworking schedules and manually fixing “automation” attempts, the role was eliminated in most US locations and moved to Asia with less experienced/new personnel. It takes time to learn these roles and gutting an important part of the business without experience. The people left behind by the haphazard layoffs are more overworked than they were when there was a full staff. Very fast paced, changes very quickly office politics layoffs when production falls constant rotation of managers 1. Lots of favourism. based on language. people causing production issues are praised because of the language they speak..!! 2. consrant rift, miscommunication and diference in openion between India and US core team. 3. People not sharing knowledge and lots of groupism. 4. HR is always there to ignore you 24 by 7. They even close the tickts assigned to them without any input. 5. finance works from different planet, need satalight rights to talk to them. 6. Even after announcing increament, delay in payout. 7. Cost cutting on essentials even after record profit. This leads uncertenity in projects and billing. etc.. etc.. Basically zero governence once you become manager. Few remaining good people are also becoming like this because of the system.If you are really good in your position and have a selfish manager, you will be locked into that position. Happened to me.

Like other companies I'm sure, it is a place where playing politics and being tactful with how you move can either pay dividends or cause you to stagnate in your career. The work life balance would not be ideal for a person looking for a 40 hour work week would not recommend any process engineering roles at this organization. The haphazard attitude of management in the 3D-NAND deposition group is only compensated for by their dishonesty and lack of accountability. This has led to half of the group leaving; including people at the director level. Furthermore, there is a severe lack of safety: in late-January Lam sent a group of engineers to China during the viral outbreak. Management claims they were not aware of this outbreak when they sent people, but all of the Chinese-based Lam employees knew about it. Bringing up this fact to management and HR gets no response. Additionally, on the same day the US cancelled all flights to China due to the coronavirus, one of the US-based employees, who returned two days earlier from China, was told they should have stayed. This employee was also not informed to quarantine despite asking management earlier, because, at the time of the outbreak, Lam was not aware this employee went China. How can Lam not account for the very employees they ask to travel? Again, management and HR have no answer. Work/life balance is awful and not recognized. Constant last minute changes with very little time to react. If the pay and benefits hadn’t been as good as they were I would have been looking elsewhere before the layoffs. It was getting to the point that even with the benefits, the lack of work/life balance was unsustainable. Lack of automation and complex work being done on Excel spreadsheets was completely inefficient and reduced already constrained time. After months of late nights reworking schedules and manually fixing “automation” attempts, the role was eliminated in most US locations and moved to Asia with less experienced/new personnel. It takes time to learn these roles and gutting an important part of the business without experience.

North America business culture is rife with finger pointing and lack of real strategic leadership or making tough decisions/trade offs. Low compensation. Accountability is lacking. Some parts of the company are lightly staffed relative to what they are being asked to do. Business results continue to be concerning for some product lines. Kaplan Singapore hires almost all its lecturers as private contractors and not employees. This strategy enables the company to save on CPF contributions, employee benefits, bypasss employment laws on direct hires. Brilliant. Lecturers (unless also a full-time staff) will have to start a business entity and Kaplan will pay them like they are third party contractors. You work, your company/business entity and hence you get paid. It is strictly a business transaction. Students’ attitude and motivation varies greatly. Chances are, if they are mature working adults, they are much better behaved, with higher levels of motivation. Particularly even more true if they paid for their course fees out of their own pocket, If they happen to be fresh school leavers (secondary school), be prepared for a rude shock. Bad manners, no work ethic and simply poor social and academic skills will test the most seasoned of lecturers. The school is a commercial entity designed to collect money while delivering the bare minimum in academic content. It’s really up to the individual student to make the best use of their money and time spent there. Students are better off at other private commercial schools like SUSS, SIM that are roughly in the same tier. People who can get into NTU, NUS, SMU and the local polytechnics will find Kaplan to be somewhat of a joke. Even the top ITE students will need to go to a tertiary institution of better quality. Cons I will divide into two: Current state of ESL industry in the US (abroad rules are different) -Hours are atrocious. I had coworkers who had Master's degrees in TESL and were working 3 jobs even though they'd been at the company for years as well as having years of prior experience. -Students are treated more like customers than students, so they have more say than you do at times. You can have a student come for one week, one for three weeks, and another for five months. Just when you feel like you are getting somewhere with your class and how the material is starting to ""click,"" you will get another new 3-5 students, and you have to decide to slow down the entire class, or continue where you left off, and leave the new students in the dust. -No such thing as job stability. There is no such things as quarters or semesters, so you have about a ten or twelve week curriculum that just starts over. Because of this, you can have your class merged with another whenever the management sees fit. (My management tried to combat this by having teachers suddenly just transition into ""subs"" who he would have go in testing rooms, etc. or give other work so that people could keep their job) -Encouraged to log less work hours for prep work, and even though we were paid for prep work, if we did more than what was expected, they would hassle us, even though it meant more efficient classroom time. Our management team was hassled by higher ups if we logged ""too much"" prep time (grading, making our own tests, preparing for class, etc.) This specific management team: -Management did nothing about sexual harassment or gossip in the office. -I think due to the teachers having little to zero job stability, it made a hyper competitive environment, and teachers gossiped about each other constantly, which made for a toxic work environment. I know gossip is fairly consistent in the workplace, but this started very heavily from my first day in the office, and felt very much like a huge part of the work culture there.

I had coworkers who had Master's degrees in TESL and were working 3 jobs even though they'd been at the company for years as well as having years of prior experience. -Students are treated more like customers than students, so they have more say than you do at times. You can have a student come for one week, one for three weeks, and another for five months. Just when you feel like you are getting somewhere with your class and how the material is starting to ""click,"" you will get another new 3-5 students, and you have to decide to slow down the entire class, or continue where you left off, and leave the new students in the dust. -No such thing as job stability. There is no such things as quarters or semesters, so you have about a ten or twelve week curriculum that just starts over. Because of this, you can have your class merged with another whenever the management sees fit. (My management tried to combat this by having teachers suddenly just transition into ""subs"" who he would have go in testing rooms, etc. or give other work so that people could keep their job) -Encouraged to log less work hours for prep work, and even though we were paid for prep work, if we did more than what was expected, they would hassle us, even though it meant more efficient classroom time. Our management team was hassled by higher ups if we logged ""too much"" prep time (grading, making our own tests, preparing for class, etc.) This specific management team: -Management did nothing about sexual harassment or gossip in the office. -I think due to the teachers having little to zero job stability, it made a hyper competitive environment, and teachers gossiped about each other constantly, which made for a toxic work environment. I know gossip is fairly consistent in the workplace, but this started very heavily from my first day in the office, and felt very much like a huge part of the work culture there. Constantly saying things about other teachers' styles of work, etc. Too much beauracracy. Company is too large. Chronically underpaid. They will pay you the absolute bare minimum. Most employees that leave do so because the pay is mediocre at best. DuoPush to login to workday is sometimes annoying a lot of manager turnover so sometimes communication was lacking"
