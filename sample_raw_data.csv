Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome. Jeff Bezos and his ""S-Team"" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth. You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment."" Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long. - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue) - A chance to make a huge difference - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions). - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction. The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here. - You can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time - Surrounded with nothing but incredibly smart and driven individuals. - Compensation is well beyond my expectations, and more than suitable. - Exciting projects all across the company that keep you interested and focused. - Amazon is changing the world This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects. Challenging sometimes fun work environment Being part of a team Doing great things Great people to work with Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough. I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be. Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros. Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break. On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse. Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive. Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill. As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time. Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time! Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area. Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking! Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you. The 4 day weeks go by quick, it can be exhausting so proper rest and a healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company. Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","Not much room for advancement You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you. The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking. - You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone. No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that. Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse. - Can be overwhelming, very steep learning curve - Can be difficult to keep up if you are not self motivated Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways. Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people."" The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street. Organization and communication can be a challenge to maneuver around Hours can become a challenge when managing a hectic schedule Having to be available for any shift in order to move up in certain positions Work expectations and policies can change and can be confusing Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon. I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays. Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company. Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket. SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else. Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long. After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate. Your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage, by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings."
1,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Deloitte-Reviews-E2763.htm,Deloitte,4.0,"Well, it's BigD isn't it? Everyone on the ball, super friendly, inclusive, very professional, some AMAZING work being done. I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed my interim role. Great benefits, motivated people, opportunities to work alongside best organizations These folks know exactly what they are doing. They set high standards, and consistently deliver. Their project expectations and planning is excellent. The top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning. If you go to company social events (which are very frequent by the way), it is quite easy to have conversations with upper management people (Partners). Deloitte's hiring pattern is very consistent. For the young starters, they hire smart, well spoken, and subtly aggressive candidates. They have excellent training and knowledge management. They have a well oiled and empowered HR and Tech Support group. Things get done pretty fast. Their paid time off program is really great, and pretty straight forward. No messing about. They have a big social responsibility program that encourages volunteering. It also presents a great opportunity for youngsters to take event organizing responsibilities. This can be very very useful. Once, I volunteered for an event where we painted rooms for an orphanage center. There was a young guy who did the organizing. We were 10-12 people, with 3 senior executives actually doing paintwork. Quite unique. I have personally seen that Deloitte's top talents tend to start young, spend a 3-4 years, then take a hiatus to pursue a Graduate Degree (typically an MBA). The firm sometimes re-hires these consultants after their MBA with generous financial incentives. They offer much better packages to folks graduating from top universities. Sometimes they can offer huge joining bonuses. I worked in the IT consulting division.They tend to get top-end projects. On projects, the average age seems pretty low. A lot of 20-somethings, then there are a handful of 30-40 year old people and some senior Management folks. Beginner salaries can be a bit low. (which is expected. It takes some time to build credibility in the Consulting business) Overall, a great place to start your professional career. If you pay attention, you will get seasoned very quickly. * Encouragement of utilizing PTO * Benefits * Financial support of certain IT Certs Benefits Pay Lucky to have a good team and managers Competitive comp, good perks and benefits, fast-paced, heavy networking culture, lots of access to senior leadership through formal and informal networking opportunities, and a wide variety of professional growth opportunities. Definitely an environment that lends itself well to those willing to be proactive and strategic in building their firm network. - Good pay right out of college - Good community building with analyst community. Strong networking potential. Fantastic group of very smart individuals and an opportunity to learn a ton early in your career. Everyone I worked with genuinely cared about one another. Pay and benefits were good and generally in line with averages for the industry. A lot of talented people who have a resume full of accolades that make you want to be better. The perks are great working at a big company too Flexible time to work per day can go to appointments and make up the hours that day instead of using pto","Not really a con, but a very large, structured environment isn't for everyone. If you prefer nimble, seat of your pants stuff, Deloitte isn't that. But then it doesn't pretend to be that. Long path to partnership, rigid growth path Work-life balance can become poor, especially during tight project timelines (This is expected in the Consulting Business). The employees have a significant amount of ""firm-internal"" training and knowledge contribution tasks. There are annual goal expectations. It can get tedious if you continuously work on high demand projects. There is intense competition, especially during targeted promotion/milestone years. There can be some backstabbing. It's part of the experience. It is not as bad as it sounds, and seems manageable. A lot of times, being young and inexperienced has it's flaws. The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work. The hands-on guy gets overwhelmed, and others try to use him/her as a key resource. -- I personally went through a crunch project, and found a number of people ""managing expectations"" (piggy backing), while a handful of people actually knew the end-to-end solution and did the hands-on work. This created a lot more work and mental anguish than needed. Because of the expressed pressure, the hands-on guys have a hard time building and growing their reputation and subsequent performance evaluation rating. This also affects the project execution timelines. IMPORTANT: Make sure you thoroughly read through your employment agreement and understand the implications. In recent years, they have started hiring for specific projects ONLY. This falls under a particular ""AMS service line"". In this case, if your assigned project gets into a problem, you are exposed to the risk of employment termination. Their HR and Management are very helpful, and they will try to get you a new project. But there are several constraints like location, your skills, and limited time. I went through this, and it was somewhat unnerving. This was one of the reasons I ended up leaving the company. * Extreme micromanagement from managers * Coaches can drop you at any point for no reason at all * Performance reviews must be done quarterly and heavily rely on if your manager likes you or not. If they give you negative reviews, you can get fired depending on if your project- based * Extreme favoritism * Long hour work week (longer than 40 hours) * No clear training in projects so you are expected to learn magically by yourself * Compensation is not competitive enough and definitely DOES NOT match the market * Horrible, terrible work environment that causes anxiety Resource Managers- Not sure what their job is within the firm. My understand was they are supposed to help look for projects as your current project ends to reduce time on the ""bench"". Mine was not helpful and barely responsive. Coaches- You can definitely tell when people are forced to be coaches and have no idea how to be helpful. Performance Management- I don't like that the process is solely based on how your Coach represents and ""fights"" for you. If due diligence is not conducted effectively with your Managers you might be out of luck in that process. Utilization- I understand this is important as it helps with revenue but if the resource manager is not helpful you can be stuck on the bench with low utilization. I definitely did my part to search and interview for new positions (if any are available) several times as my projects ended but that process and even having to do so is crazy to me. For Consulting, internal firm initiatives and non-billable (some might say ""extra-curricular"") work is required even if you are fully utilized, which can contribute to burnout. Some new joiners struggle to grasp the schmoozy / political elements of culture at first. Similarly, some new joiners struggle to build a strong reputation early on and have a hard time getting staffed on projects. It's very easy to take on too much and/or spread oneself too thin in attempts to stand out among other (mostly) ambitious colleagues. - Little transparency from management (many rounds of unexpected layoffs with improper communication) - Promised flexibility to choose projects and teams to gain a wide range of industry exposure, but not true in practice. Many analysts did not get placed in the vertical of their choosing (e.g., Strategy & Analytics, Mergers & Acquisitions, Customer & Marketing, etc.) and were often stuck on long healthcare projects in random cities with no hope of changing roles soon. - Performance reviews are subjective, but scored quantitatively. If a manager simply does not like you or vibe with you, they can give you a low score (1-5). You are then put on a scatterplot against all other analysts who may be less good at their job but favored by leadership. Only the top of the scatterplot gets promoted. Covert sexism and racism at play here. - Fratty, misogynistic environment - Nepotism also favored - Some get a great work life balance, some get a horrible work life balance. No culture of a good work life balance is promoted throughout the company. People get competitive over who works longer hours thinking it will aid performance. Even those who work long hours and perform well get laid off with little notice (24 hours.) Over time, you may find yourself pigeonholed into an area of expertise (and even a very specific function within that area), which stunts technical growth. There is a strong bias towards project management generalists (probably more a reflection of the industry as a whole rather than unique to Deloitte) with sales skills rather than technical expertise. Deloitte does try to address this by creating a ""specialist"" track, but it was apparent to me that the career prospects of specialists were limited relative to those on a generalist track. It is hard at times to find a new project through networking. Too many teams to handle/ can’t specialize and focus on one type of client. Not much work life balance, staff has too many pto days and schedule does not allow to take. The pto expires as only 8 days roll over."

There is a lot of support at the home office. Your colleagues and your functional leadership have your back. They support you with training, answering day-to-day questions, collaboration, and help resolve cross-functional disagreements. Cross functional teams also generally work well together. The people you work with genuinely care about you. The culture is very down-to-earth, respectful, and friendly.

They had a good team in the personal shopper dept People at Wal Mart work hard and don’t think you can come here and slack off because they watch you especially if your new Being around people, that work, hard, honest working people Learning Curve: I was exposed to a variety of writing assignments, from product descriptions to ad campaigns, which allowed me to hone my writing skills in a professional setting. Diverse Team: The team is a mix of seasoned professionals and young talents, which made for an excellent platform for mentorship and peer learning. Resources: Given it's Walmart, there were ample resources and tools provided to ensure the job was done efficiently. The tech support and the content management systems were up-to-date. Stable Employment: Walmart is a large and established retail company, offering relative job security and stability. Career Growth: Working as a manager at Walmart can provide opportunities for career advancement within the company, with potential for promotions to higher-level managerial positions. Benefits: Walmart typically offers its employees a range of benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, employee discounts, and more. Training and Development: Walmart provides training programs and resources to help managers improve their leadership skills, which can be valuable for personal and professional growth. Lots of work so consistent pay, Tuition assistance for college degree GED assistance Vision insurance coverage is actually good if you need glasses. Dental coverage is good if you need it, covers 2 cleanings per year. Reliable every two-week paycheck.","Customers getting in the way Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees. There are only 2 disadvantages to working here: 1) Regular layoffs. If a function is being eliminated because it is no longer relevant then I suggest to transparently tell people the role will be going away in X amount of time, and people can choose between taking another role, and taking a severance package. The people who don't take the severance package can then be moved into another role. The company is so large that there are always hundreds of open positions, so there should always be a place for people that want to stay."" 2) Organizations are forced to rank their people and a certain % of people HAVE to be in the less than average bucket. Although this weeds out lower performers, it also causes some people who do an excellent job to have their bonus/equity reduced. Salve labor Lack of pay Lack of care Lack of safety Sending people home early and borrowing other people from different departments to make up for sending people home Overworked If you put open availability they will take advantage of that and work you every Friday and Saturday and Sunday until you just ask for one off in advance. I didn’t like the the “pick rate” system, and there are ways to cheat to make it look like you are going really fast but you aren’t. I would see people hiding out and bagging while I’m fighting for my life and still “too slow”. They watch the cameras and was told they saw me go to the restroom after a pick walk and that I need to let them know next time. The place started to feel like jail and I realized my worth really quickly and left. But again, this job was not as serious to me as they were wanting me to see it. Found something more sustainable. The hard work that my team and I do we should be getting paid at least close to the overnighters because we're literally the backbone of the store but no one will know what we go through unless you actually work with us. Have you ever unload a semi truck trailer? How about unloading two of those in one day and then the frozen and dairy truck to unload plus downs stock by departments. Oh don't forget about the other semi truck trailer the remix pallets.. more pallets to unload and downs stock by departments... and we're not working in team there's other tasks that we have to do some of us might be in a team of 4 or 2 but that's only to unload the truck and there's one person inside the trailer and the workers sort out the items that come from the trailer.. then you got other team members to go off solo vic-pick different departments. Maybe it sounds like a big team but it's not really much of a big team. Sometimes there's 8 people in a shift orders less than that.. well before we get to unload the trailer trucks, we go zone and help out the other team to zone the store. Volume of Work: While the diversity of tasks was a boon, the sheer volume sometimes became overwhelming. Deadlines could be tight, and there were days I felt the pressure immensely. Creativity Limitation: At times, I felt my creativity was boxed in. Understandably, a company as big as Walmart has brand guidelines, but I sometimes felt there was little room for out-of-the-box thinking. Corporate Hierarchy: Navigating the corporate structure was a bit challenging. Getting approvals or feedback on a piece sometimes required going through multiple layers, which could be time-consuming. Long Hours: Managers at Walmart might need to work long and irregular hours, including evenings, weekends, and holidays, to ensure the store's smooth operation. Work-Life Balance: The demanding schedule and responsibilities of a manager at Walmart could potentially lead to challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Pressure and Stress: Retail management can be stressful due to high customer expectations, operational challenges, and the need to meet sales targets. Employee Turnover: The retail industry, including Walmart, can experience high employee turnover, which might lead to constant hiring and training efforts for managers. Handling Difficult Customers: Manage Very tiring and boring because stocking the same things everyday. Bananas and onions and turkeys are the heaviest items youll deal with, each weighing like 40lbs and can be tiring, having to clean everyday and stock the salsas and salads everyday gets very boring and tedious. Medical coverage is horrible, premiums are too high combined with high deductibles and high copays. No training for new hires sets people up to fail. Long term employees are no longer seen as assets to the company, they are seen as disposable. Starting rates have gone up for new hires but there have been no new raises for long term employees."

They don’t train you at all just stick you at a position and pay you training instead of regular pay. Which is nonsense because you never are trained at all. Stuck up coworkers and bosses. they gossip none stop and make up rumors that are not true about you and you can hear them on the headset which is rude and disrespectful and discrimination. They never let you finish on time or make you leave early due to production or service times. If I’m scheduled for a time to work from beginning I walk in the door I expect to work the time I’m scheduled for I don’t care about their production or service time because they can’t schedule or run a business right. Sorry but people need money to live on and to pay their bills and to eat and be able to pay rent or mortgage on their home. Horrible company to work for. One significant drawback of this job is that it can be very tiring. The nature of the work requires sustained physical or mental effort, which can lead to exhaustion over time. The job may involve long hours, physically demanding tasks, or mentally draining responsibilities that can take a toll on one's energy levels and overall well-being. The constant fatigue can affect work-life balance, personal relationships, and overall quality of life.

Busy and plenty of work. There's no pro about Infosys.","Good good good good good good Infosys clearly puts a preference on India-based employees first, then India employees who have relocated to the USA or Canada (I can speak to North America - I'm sure it is the same globally); if you are an American of non-Indian ancestry expect to be discriminated . Infosys is willing to be sued, break laws and pays fines as a ""cost of doing business""; this is readily documented and is no secret. If you look at those who get awards, are Delivery Managers, Directors, Industry Principles, leadership in general, 98% are from India yet Infosys does over 60% of their business in North America. All JL6 and below are treated no differently than a ""replaceable cog in a machine."" Granted, I'm sure there are areas in Infosys that are not like this. This has been my experience for close to 3 years. I gave it a go for personal reasons to WFH due to family needs, and I'm ready to leave. Over the past 3 years I've been here, global attrition has been just over 25% (per SEC Quarterly Reports); INFY employs over 350,000 worldwide, do the turnover and loss of intellectual capital math. No sense of loyalty, just as much billable time and ""show me the money"". We all have reasons to stay for an employer. Your choice. I'm ready to leave. Lack of management processes creates a lackadaisical atmosphere. Very little career coaching or guidance. Feels like no upward mobility is possible unless you’re a ‘tech.’ If you’re in services like Business Development or Consulting, the career advancement is slow, vague and just depends on how many years you’ve been there. It helps if you’re Indian. If you’re a westerner, you can feel tokenized and not taken seriously. Many feel they’re here just to be a western face of the org for clients, but hold no actual sway in the internal politics of the organization. Also the internal HR systems and platforms are horrible (travel requests, time off requests, reimbursements, project assigning, and employee-management reviews). All horrible UX and ironically, not integrated with eachother. The leadership has no clue. I worked for the company for two years and never met my supervisors. I worked directly as “staff Aug” to my customers. Had I knew they were simply a staffing company, I would not have accepted a position with them. They send you to a lot of ethical training but the HR team doesn’t follow their own advice. My layoff wasn’t even in writing. They also with held taxes from states where I never worked and kept the withholding. I was the last non-Indian working in my division before being let go. They owe me in excess of $10,000 in back pay while claiming to own my patent. My pay was never close to my last job. It barely paid the bills and they expect you to relocate on your own dime. - salary wasn’t competitive at the time and there was no incentive to keep employees like annual/performance bonuses, negligible salary increases - some managers think they can get work done by yelling and could be poor at planning and good at blame game. - if you’re good, you’ll get too much work just to save money from hiring other devs - I had a meeting 4 days a week late at 10pm and early at 8am to accommodate for offshore team. The late night show was canceled after about 6 months. - Low pay - Don't feel part of any company they are nor good to pay your rights as relocation exp, and unused leaves. -Work variety can mean very kind hours or very unkind hours --I was asked explicitly to lie if work went beyond 40 hours a week -Was asked to come in on weekends for a time with hours from 8AM-11PM --Management from the host company eventually told us we were simply not allowed to work as late as we did -Experienced a senior employee of 15 years, my supervisor, lying about me committing malpractice in front of my manager. I had receipts to disprove this, but I can only imagine how others were affected here given the length of his tenure -Was pushed to make unit tests for the sake of coverage rather than meaningful testing. Could be a product of the host company's policies in that case, granted Sometimes harder to feel like you are apart of a team To start, the salary is lower than average. Way lower. The trainee during their Java training is rude and makes fun of employees that make mistakes. She also yelled constantly and treated the team from Mexico even worst than the team from the US. Managers never respond to employees. They ignore both emails and Teams messages. Neither the project managers will respond to you after they interview you for projects. I never got this business model, the company trains you but the project managers expect more knowledge than the one the company provided on the training. They only provide opportunities to employees they like. And they're disorganized, I have to repeat myself a lot of times cause they neither listen to you as an employee nor check your profile at all. They don't follow any structure at all. Worst of all, when you finally get mapped to a project, they won't pay for your relocation. At this moment, I'm in a bureaucratic nightmare with them cause they tell me different instructions, send me to different people, and make me repeat myself cause they don't even read the email chains or the previously submitted requests. Overall, Infosys is just another company that preys on recent graduates and ruin their careers."

Diverse Services: The company offers a broad spectrum of services, allowing employees to gain experience across different industries and domains. Learning and Development: Accenture places a strong emphasis on training and professional development. Employees often have access to a wide range of learning resources and opportunities to enhance their skills. Networking: Working at a large company like Accenture provides opportunities to network with professionals from various backgrounds and industries, which can be valuable for career growth. Client Exposure: Accenture works with a range of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, which can offer employees exposure to high-profile projects and significant challenges. Innovation: The company often engages in cutting-edge technologies and innovation, which can provide employees with the chance to work on exciting and forward-looking projects. Flexibility: Accenture has been known to offer flexible work arrangements, including remote work options, which can improve work-life balance. Mostly very nice people, and yet extremely diverse. You can get the experience of working on projects all across company value chains, dealing with clients of all levels and backgrounds.","Raleigh is small office, fewer local clients than other offices, so travel may be necessary, but great company regardless Hard to know who is who. 750,000 employees. This is not an opportunity for those that do not want to work. At Accenture everyone has a load of work to do and often times under very tight customer time lines. It is a challenge that I enjoy but many might find it stressful. You never know when you will be laid off unless you are staffed on a project. I took this role in the beginning of the year and was told by staffing recruiter that I would not have to find my own projects, and was already assigned a project when hired. Upon onboarding, I discovered that a large population of Consultants must find their own work, with the exception of my team. I have been waiting to be staffed on a project for over 6 months. Management started to expect us to look for our own projects, and the only way to be successful is via networking. If you try to use MyScheduler to find projects you are screwed! It’s not really the fault of the company, but more so the state of the economy that I have not been staffed. I do blame recruiters for lack of transparency because I feel like I was scammed. Based off my skill-set and practice, projects are slim in financial services. Also, be aware that if you interview for project roles with other teams, no one tells you ahead of time what to expect for the role or interview. I went into client interviews blind, and felt like I was not set up for success. I’m still awaiting to be staffed. - C-Suite doesn't know what their doing....all decisions are being made on the fly (like laying off 19k people but not actually saying who, and when the layoffs are going to happen...) - HR Partners are useless (they act like their actually able to help staff you but really can't) - It's up to you to find your own projects and build a vast network and if you're unable to because projects related to your specialty aren't available or you have a poor manager who isn't able to connect you with other people in your practice.... you'll most likely be ""connected"" out by your 8th week on the bench. Corporate is not in touch with our team and has often disregarded important feedback and requested us to do things not mentioned in our contract. If you are hired as Flex, Accenture will not provide you with another contract when you roll off. They also have laid off teams who are unionizing. - during rough times it gets pretty cut throat with the up or out mentality. Drives people anxious about whose going to get cut - lots of different working groups, networks, industry, job family alignment makes it super confusing to follow - PTO balances don’t carry over after 200 hours. Wish they had PTO buy back programs. - not enough accenture swag - would like to see more benefits like parking to be reimbursed at accenture offices, second cell phone for managers and up, desktop monitor or chair, if you work 10+ hours we get to reimburse food/Uber eats or something - vision plan is with united health -> wish we had VSP or something BETTER Rigid promotion structure. Hard to get the deserved pay due to the size Workload and Hours: Consulting and professional services firms often come with demanding workloads and tight project deadlines, which can lead to long working hours and potential burnout. Travel Requirements: Some roles at Accenture may require frequent travel, which can be challenging for those who value stability and a consistent home life. Hierarchy and Bureaucracy: Being a large organization, Accenture can sometimes have layers of hierarchy and bureaucratic processes that can slow down decision-making and innovation. Variable Project Experience: The nature of consulting means that the quality and type of projects can vary widely. Not all projects may align with an employee's interests or career goals. Pressure to Perform: Due to the competitive nature of consulting, employees might feel pressure to constantly prove their value and meet high performance expectations. High Turnover: The consulting industry, in general, can experience high employee turnover due to the demanding nature of the work and the opportunities that arise in other companies. Uncertainty: Like any business, Accenture can be influenced by market fluctuations and economic conditions, potentially leading to changes in staffing and project availability. Too many people, you can really get lost in the matrix. This is especially true if you don't find your group early and establish your ""specialty"" skill-set. And if you don't find your niche area early, it can be tough to have a consistent success rate when it comes to projects you will actually enjoy."
7,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/IBM-Reviews-E354.htm,IBM,3.9,"Great company. Fantastic trading program. Move at your own pace Decent benefits Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain. But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.). Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 2. Great colleagues! Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact. 1. Good benefits if you want to pay for them 2. Excellent 401K match that is paid monthly. It used to be paid at the end of the year. 3. They do have good industry alignment with a lot of technical talent. You get to sell cutting edge products with some of the smartest people around. IBM is recreating itself and doing some really cool things in the Quantum and AI space. IBM isn't flashy but it is dependable. The work-life balance is great. The pay scales are better at the tail end of the bands. You're not getting the hyper-inflated pay but you're also not being worked to the bone. IBM gets a bad rep because it's compared to a lot of other bloated companies. It's actually an amazing place to work. Stable work life balance and fair compensation. Interesting projects with large clients. Was almost never on bench - which seemed to be rare at other consulting firms. Global Presence and Impact: IBM is a multinational technology company with a vast global presence. Working for IBM can provide you with opportunities to work on projects that have a significant impact on various industries worldwide. Cutting-Edge Technology: IBM has a long history of innovation and research in technology. As a software engineer, you might have the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, participate in research, and contribute to the development of advanced solutions. Career Growth and Learning: IBM offers various training and development programs for its employees. You'll likely have access to resources for continuous learning, skill enhancement, and opportunities to grow within the company. Diverse Projects and Roles: IBM operates across a wide range of industries, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to data analytics and cybersecurity. This diversity can provide software engineers with the chance to work on different types of projects and explore various roles. Work-Life Balance: IBM, like many established tech companies, often places emphasis on maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The company might offer flexible working arrangements and support initiatives that prioritize employee well-being. Great opportunities to move around and access to learning and certification at the expense of the company. Lots of educational resources available","No complaints. Great company work and people low pay contract job you have to use your own vehicle to get from site to site Everyone is older and skip processes and leaving you to clean up the work 1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%). This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary. Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary. From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets. This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future. Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come... 1. Too much internal competition for sales betwenn GEOs/Global, sofware/consulting. Sharks are out for a limited pie. They all want a slice. 2. No work life balance 3. Management does not have the proper controls in place to manage offshore development and then wonders why deliverables do not turn out what they were expecting 4. Too much middle management. What is the purpose of these people and why are we paid $500K to a $1M dollars per year. Where is the transparency for what the are doing? 5. Management is solely focused on making the quarterly dividend which they keep raising every quarter and/or year. This leads to more of a short term focus on making everyone billable and less time for reusable asset making or working on bids and proposals. 6. Interview your management team wisely. Picking a the wrong managment team can be detrimental to your career. Google ""IBM Age Discrimination Lawsuit"" and brace yourself. The Google ""IBM Commissions lawsuits"" for round two. In 30 years in sales, I have never had a company try to screw me out of a very large commission the week after a deal signed. They claimed there had been an administrative error and cancelled my incentive letter, issuing a new one for me to sign that would have cut my commission in half. There was no mistake. I knew the compensation plan my colleagues were on and it was the same as mine. Managers who I thought were friends were spineless and went along with this farce. When I sought legal representation, I was surprised to learn how common this practice was. IBM has a culture that promotes technocrats, not leaders. You can make good money at IBM, if they decide to pay you. Current sales management cannot be trusted. IBM isn't going to have free Breakfast, Lunches, and Dinners. You're not going to get any handouts either. IBM works very well for a self-starter or someone that's willing to put in the extra mile to succeed. There aren't currently a lot of perks (events, happy hours, free merch). It's a little grindy at the moment if you want to progress upward. You also, and probably most importantly are at a company where they're rediscovering what it means to be profitable. There's a lot of belt-tightening going on. Bureaucratic hurdles due to company size. Can be slow at times in reacting to markets. Bureaucracy and Size: Due to its size and complexity, IBM can sometimes be perceived as having layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes might be slower and more convoluted in a large organization. Job Security: Like many corporations, IBM has undergone periods of restructuring and layoffs. Job security can be a concern, especially during challenging economic times or shifts in the company's strategic direction. Innovation Pace: While IBM is known for its history of innovation, some critics argue that the company has faced challenges in keeping up with the fast-paced changes in the tech industry compared to newer, more agile startups. Hierarchy and Advancement: Advancement within a large organization like IBM might require navigating a hierarchical structure. Progression might not always be solely based on merit, and some employees might find it challenging to move up the corporate ladder. Workload and Pressure: Depending on the specific role and project, software engineers at IBM might face high workloads and tight deadlines. Balancing the demands of the job with personal life can be challenging at times The pay isn’t great unless you change positions or leave and come back. Not enough interesting projects in pipeline"
8,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Microsoft-Reviews-E1651.htm,Microsoft,4.3,"Well-defined SOP's High-caliber, intelligent co-workers Best benefits package I've had 1. If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop. 2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations. If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice. 3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire. There are still many good things about Microsoft. The compensation is fairly high (though not the highest), and the benefits are good overall. Many of my colleagues are smart, positive, helpful people. - ability to work on several known brands - remote friendly - gain experience working in a fast paced environment - ability to shape your career by specializing in specific products/features - gain experience managing million dollar portfolios - enjoy good benefits that Microsoft offers such as Perk+ (health & wellness stipend) Every year the Pros are less and less, but what keeps most around is the medical benefits and perks. As with any company, your experience is largely affected by the people you work most closely with. I work with amazing people and we deal with internal and external challenges as a team. I also work for an amazing leader who treats his team like professionals. Compared to my previous industry, defense contracting system integrators, the compensation is significantly better. I'm not sure how it compares to other tech companies, but I know the culture here is significantly better. Beyond my immediate sphere of people I work with, Satya Nadella is an amazing human being and CEO. He promotes hard work, he is transparent, he handles communicating bad news well and promotes and lives by an inclusive culture. 1. Good company vision, value and culture, on paper at least. 2. Good benefits, promote a healthy lifestyle. 3. Compensation is OK too, at least keeps up with mainstream. 4. Most people are nice, for real, helpful and kind. Tech will continue to grow, so if you can manage to stay under the current leadership then you will make good money with stock benefits. 100% med insurance coverage for the whole family. Nice office if you use it. 401k 50% match. Microsoft pays well and has the best benefits that I've ever seen for any company, especially for health insurance.","It's a commercial company and my industry is federal so there are a lot of gaps in their compensation models for sellers to the Defense Industrial Base Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies. Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"". The phrase ""do more with less"" is once again becoming toxic at Microsoft. First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave. It's not good lately. - the strategy for Microsoft Advertising is weak (for example, MSAN is a joke and it continued to be pushed onto AMs to pitch) - the segment is small enough that there seems to be cliques within management/leadership - not the best promotion and retention of poc employees - be ready to deal with a lot of passive aggressiveness - the segment is a dinosaur when it comes to implementing client feedback and requests A lot nowadays. The speak of culture but it is just lip service. The LT gives a preso on it but never is there any action items behind it. Seems a lot of new LT, managers that want to come in and change everything. Change can be good, but first learn the Microsoft processes before you determine it needs changing. Little to no trust in SLT, say one thing, does another. Unless you are a huge self-promoter, you will never go anywhere. Seems like 25 percent of the people, do the work for the other 75 percent who doesnt. Some of the cons of the sales environment are internal and conflicting sales competition, sales tools, processes and policies. 1. No decent way to submit formal internal complaints. 2. HR is outsourced and won't help you that much. 3. Low chance for promotion and upward movement. 4. Fired for nonsense reasons, with no warning previously, no chance for appeal. One day out of blue manager told me I was performing ""well below minimum expect level"", ""cannot complete task independently"", ""do not respect company culture"", ""disrupt team environment"", among other nonsense reasons. I have no formal channel to complain, manger's mangers (M2) doesn't take me seriously and say I lack respect for my manager's judgement. Next month I was terminated for performing well below minimum expect level and have no way to appeal. Left a message to CEO on Teams the day I left saying I have absolute confidence anyone I worked with, aside from my manager, will say I perform just as well, if not better than my coworkers. I know it doesn't change anything though. I would sue for wrongful termination, but I don't have money or energy to fight 10 years+ lawsuit with MS. I was a huge Satya fan. But his leaders under him have lost their way. They talk about leading with customer first approach, but that is no longer the case. Back to the old days of we build it and industry will conform to what we build. The hiring of the VP for Services and his hiring of leaders over two years ago have yielded nothing. Zero direction from company leadership. All Accenture hires in UK, and nothing in feedback from any of them. So sad. I was a devote MSFT believer. There was so many talks about special Microsoft culture. I didn't notice anything special at all. Even in start ups I felt more comfortable and had better team spirit. Management is a mess in Microsoft. No one really understand scope of taks, everything should be done yesterday. Manager tries to push down provided estimates and add extra work during the sprint. There's no budget to bug fixes. As results nothing is done in time and all blames goes to engineers. I worked for small start up and I know what is real pressure when the future of the whole company depends on the release. So I know what is hard work and I get used to work overtime. But in MS it's even worse, mostly because you efforts isn't recognized. MS culture promises life work balance and management pretend that they support this balance, but there's no such balance at all. MS push you to work overtime constantly, it's normal to work 12h a day and even on weekends. Microsoft feels very collegial and not in a good way. People who have been there for a long time call themselves ""Softees"". The top corporate leadership went to similar ivy league schools and have been there for more than 15 years, so they protect each other. It's very tough being a new manager to offer a different opinion, it's frowned on. They say they want people of diverse backgrounds to participate in introducing new ideas, but it's mostly lip service, since direct bosses will discourage it. Some bosses are frankly afraid, since they don't know anything else besides the ""Softee"" way. Microsoft works in a matrix leadership instead of a pyramid, which is unproductive and very political, since you most likely will not just have one boss, but a ""skip"" boss too that will compete to manage you. Middle management gets stuck in the middle, so it takes much longer to execute projects than it should be."
9,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Tata-Consultancy-Services-Reviews-E13461.htm,Tata Consultancy Services,3.9,"Good perks as an employee During my time at TCS, I had the fantastic opportunity to work as a full stack developer on a project called ""Dyna-Port."" This project was all about creating a web application that could effectively monitor various activities within ports and automate the invoicing process for those activities. I was deeply involved in the development process, and I used a combination of Java, the Spring framework, PL/SQL, and Ext JS to bring the project to life. Being a part of this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building complex web applications and working with a diverse range of technologies. I played a crucial role in designing and implementing features that helped streamline the monitoring of port activities and the generation of invoices. This experience significantly enhanced my technical skills and gave me a strong understanding of how different components come together to create a cohesive application. Benefits and salary are pretty solid, currently (mostly) Work From Home. Management is helpful and friendly. If your teams contract with the account holder is terminated, TCS gives ample notice and planning steps to help you transition to a new position somewhere else. Good if you are consultancy company Good company to start your career. Good work life balance at work Very trust worthy & stable employer 1) Job security 2) A lot of projects, technologies and domains to work on. 3) Okayish benefits 4) They reimburse part of initial settling costs like car rental/taxi, taxi charges from airport to hotel, 2 weeks of hotel stay etc Lots of training material Good salary, no delays in payment. Huge projects, When present good leaders tasks and deliverables are clear. TCS is one of the top tier institution to work with. Good work life balance if you work on a project which matches your aspiration.","Not much negative other than employee videos Looking back, I can confidently say that my time on the ""Dyna-Port"" project was not only a great learning opportunity but also a chance to contribute to a meaningful solution for port management and operations. A lot of positions put TCS in the role of a staffing firm. You work for companies that hire TCS, not directly doing TCS things. Because of this, you're always depending on whether or not the company TCS is contracted to wants to renew their contract. Salary is the problem here Not a very good company to stay for long term. Salary hike is limited and not consistent Lower pay scale & process takes a bit of time. 1) Promotions not happening for the past 3 years 2) Some projects have a lot of politics 3) Pay is quite low. 4) Too many follow-ups to be done for reimbursement claims. Sometimes you don´t get full information of what to do and why, this way is hard to fulfill customer expectation. Some unpredicted calls. Passive HR, sometimes you need to explain who you are and what you do in company... Can't say anything negative about my favorite organization other than the payscale."
