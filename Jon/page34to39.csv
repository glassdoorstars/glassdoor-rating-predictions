They barely offered equal opportunities for less experienced engineers to develop technical skills. They awarded some people who never went to work for almost two years, and punished some hard working onsite people who had a legitimate reason for a time off just over a week. So biased, once the managers didn't see fancy PPT slides, you would be in a danger. Not just managers, they forced a lot of engineers who had a lot of tasks in the lab to join daily useless and non-relevant meetings for at least 3-4 hours, then you have put a lot of over time to finish the work should be done during regular schedule. Since they always spent more time on meeting rather than working, the projects were always delayed with a poor quality result. Promotion opportunities are infrequent and once you're in the company they only give you a 2% annual raise. You can promote ""tiers"" or ""ranks"" for a larger raise but they try to stifle financial growth as much as possible making job hopping seem a better option than company loyalty. I've seen people with less industry experience hire in at nearly 40% higher pay than someone who stuck with the company and tried to promote from within. There is no manager. There is someone hired as the manager but they are rarely on site. Coworkers can lie to HR without any evidence and just will go through. It has happened to at least 4 people who I know. You can just come at whatever time you want and take as many breaks as you want without any form of write up or warning. People show up 30-45 minutes late, take double the time for lunch and leave half an hour early. Somehow these people get overtime EVERY pay period. Its quite the mystery how, maybe something to do with nepotism and or favoritism. There is no expectation on your job performance. People make mistakes constantly and we were not able to tell them they did something wrong so the person will make the same error daily. Nepotism. There are a ton of families working here all over the campus and at all levels of the organization . That means if you are not family you probably won't get promoted or a higher position. Management finicky. Leading you on about growth opportunities. Lower base than competition. Lots of lies and gaslighting. Sometimes organizational structure gets confusing and it is difficult for workers to find the right contacts or support for their issue. From a software perspective, some of the toolchains are a little dated but they are working to bring some aspects up to date. Pay is something that might discourage some people.

Not just managers, they forced a lot of engineers who had a lot of tasks in the lab to join daily useless and non-relevant meetings for at least 3-4 hours, then you have put a lot of over time to finish the work should be done during regular schedule. Since they always spent more time on meeting rather than working, the projects were always delayed with a poor quality result. Promotion opportunities are infrequent and once you're in the company they only give you a 2% annual raise. You can promote ""tiers"" or ""ranks"" for a larger raise but they try to stifle financial growth as much as possible making job hopping seem a better option than company loyalty. I've seen people with less industry experience hire in at nearly 40% higher pay than someone who stuck with the company and tried to promote from within. There is no manager. There is someone hired as the manager but they are rarely on site. Coworkers can lie to HR without any evidence and just will go through. It has happened to at least 4 people who I know. You can just come at whatever time you want and take as many breaks as you want without any form of write up or warning. People show up 30-45 minutes late, take double the time for lunch and leave half an hour early. Somehow these people get overtime EVERY pay period. Its quite the mystery how, maybe something to do with nepotism and or favoritism. There is no expectation on your job performance. People make mistakes constantly and we were not able to tell them they did something wrong so the person will make the same error daily. Nepotism. There are a ton of families working here all over the campus and at all levels of the organization . That means if you are not family you probably won't get promoted or a higher position. Management finicky. Leading you on about growth opportunities. Lower base than competition. Lots of lies and gaslighting. Sometimes organizational structure gets confusing and it is difficult for workers to find the right contacts or support for their issue. From a software perspective, some of the toolchains are a little dated but they are working to bring some aspects up to date. Pay is something that might discourage some people. Political with tendency to make things personal, can make too many demands/load too many tasks making job overwhelming."

I'm paying more in my monthly paycheck and out of pocket for routine preventative visits than I have with previous companies. - Compensation is NOT COMPETITIVE (i.e. lower than other companies), and NOT CONSISTENT. HR continues to put out a narrative and rhetoric that AZ pays competitively, but you can ask employees about how they've been paid at other companies and it is not as good. Mind you, you're not getting pennies, but for a global, large company, AZ is absolutely riding on their reputation as the biggest company in Maryland to pay less than the competition. As a general rule, ASK YOUR CO-WORKS ABOUT SALARIES. Management and HR will make it seem like that brews jealousy and stirs the pot in the workplace but this information helps all employees learn what their company thinks they are worth. For example: it was found out that some new undergraduate employees were actually being paid MORE than a full-time employee with 2 years of experience at AZ. Can you imagine being at a company for 2 years and find out that a brand new college graduate is being paid more than you? - Senior leadership is 100% profit driven in their decision-making, with little regard to everyone below them. The company is unfocused. Priorities shift wildly and urgently - you can work incredibly hard for months on a project and then your project is immediately trashed because another company came out with a product before AstraZeneca. Alternatively, you can be assigned a project and have to get it through development as fast as possible because there's a race to get to clinicals and someone is already working on that therapeutic. AZ is always 1 step behind, chasing trends, rather than being a trendsetter or leader in the industry. I know AZ is a for-profit company, so of course decisions are profit-driven. But those decisions are seemingly made to burn out and turnover employees at the lower salary levels because those are the cheapest and quickest employees to replace. AZ lives in an area with access to a lot of impressive universities so they know they can just churn through new graduates every single year - teach them the skills they need the first year, and grind them until they leave. - I think since senior leadership knows AZ is lagging behind others, some development groups are pushed HARD. While I think work-life balance is very good under a lot of groups, other groups that senior leadership is very interested in seeing succeed are pressured with insane timelines, and that pressure cascades down all the way to the bottom level employees who are doing the labwork. Some scientists have worked every single weekend for the first 6 months of this year. Some scientists have accumulated so much compensation time but they have no avenue to take all that time off because they are expected to hit certain goals for their projects. I have been fortunate to not be involved in any of this but I see it and it does not look good. Last notes: I have not worked in other companies in this area. I do not know if people come to AZ because all the other companies in Maryland are worse, and AZ is just the only option in the area with the best mix of salary, culture, and stability. But being the best of the worst doesn't make it good. Also, this list of cons makes it seem like it's awful to work here. It's not at all. There are worse companies to work for all around. This long list of cons is here to show that we have high expectations of AZ considering it's reputation and size. AZ is a successful company, and it should seemingly have the profits to compensate its employees better. No one cares about mugs and shirts and freebies with the AZ logo on them. Pay people better. Get people better health insurance. Respect people's 40 hour work weeks. Not much. Maybe just the location isn't that great. There is limited flexibility for working at various office sites or 100% remote. Some senior leaders have been in the same position too long, giving them a disproportionate amount of influence and at times innovation can stagnate. ""this is how we normally do things."" The longer the person in role, the more opportunity or lack of for others. The sales force is large which could lead to future downsizing Busy and varied schedules based on work Most groups have top-down culture that rewards ""yes-man"" mentality, people with no management experience being promoted into managerial roles with 4+ direct reports, elitism, politics (even among scientists) Not a lot of community between teams Sometimes your product portfolio can change.I don't see any cons for now - AZ health insurance through Aetna is absolute GARBAGE.

Not really sure if this is a con. No promotion guaranteed, hours fluctuate detrimentally regardless if open availability I remember when the onboarding coordinator, Estella, told us that “we’re like family here!” And she’s not entirely wrong, because the relationship among employees and management is dysfunctional and toxic like most families. A manager and a coordinator had the nerve to talk smack on, right in front of me while putting racks of clothes away. I should’ve walked out from there. Hourly pay is astonishingly low and you aren’t guaranteed much or any hours. Management will claim that there’s no payroll, but they’ll hire a bunch of new associates! The company is extremely antiunion and they don’t care about their workers. There really is no incentive or benefits of working for Marshall’s. Management and employees are miserable and only work there for the little crumbs in their paycheck. There is no community in that store and the coordinators have no right to have such massive egos. Yearly raises are less than a dollar. I've been there nearly 2 years, starting as full time then going to part-time, and my total raise amount has been 0.93 cents. You're made to work all over the store in various departments with no incentives or bonuses for the extra work. I was hired to work in one department, but after a few months I became a cashier, a stockroom associate, fitting room attendant, etc. You receive very little acknowledgment for going above and beyond. A pat on the back if that. When you're on the register, you're expected to help meet a quota for selling the store's credit card. You don't receive any compensation for it. The ""incentive"" is a chance to win a $20 Marshalls gift card. Ridiculous. The minimum pay here is not a livable wage at all. Making $12-$13/hr can not afford their employees to live in this area where apartments are starting off at $1200/mo. There will certainly be some stressful days where you will learn how to work under pressure but as long you have a can do attitude and view it as an opportunity to learn and enhance performance under pressure, you can do it!

Bad leaders get promoted. Good people get abused and taken advantage of. You’re supposed to only be schedule 2 DAYS with 3rd day as a need basis. What they really mean is you’ll be scheduled ALL 3 DAYS. And for part timers that means ALL 3 DAYS 8+ HOURS EVERY WEEK!!Full time get mandated a lot for their 6th day when they’re new too but the major difference is that full timers are scheduled for only 6 hours for some reason. It’s completely ridiculous and actually makes no sense as to why they do this!!!! Scheduling, hours, lack of communication, lack of transit, lack of end goal, ATTENDANCE POINTS NO SICK DAYS - don’t get sick at Disney they don’t care, NO TRAINING they just throw you on the job pretty much. No room for promotion unless you are magically favored by management. Workers Comp is never there for you and will never answer your phone calls. No flexibility in schedule when you gain seniority in the company you can only change your schedule once or twice a year so if you want to go to school and they change your schedule you are now screwed The management is horrible and does not work well. Very biased work environment, amongst cast members /drivers. Too many trying to come up. A lot of micro management. The health Ins deductions are so expensive, and so are the union dues."

Some of the team leads should not be in that position. As they are unable to handle difficult conversations or choose not to do anything about a complaint you may have. There is no real reward in our department for doing a great job or going above and beyond. So departments though so reward their people with care card gift certificates but that is based on what your direct management wants to do for the bakery we never get any. You are only talked to when they want to complain about something you did. In the last few years the company has become more profit driven and as a result just isn’t concerned with the lives of their worker anymore. They do nice things like bbqs and food in the break room but if you are seriously Ill and out of work for weeks, no one will care. You won’t get even on call or text. If you have a condition that keep you in pain everyday and come to work and do your job regardless and do a good job, don’t expect management to ever ask how you’re doing or how you’re treatments are going because they don’t care. The younger team leaders will care and ask, but that’s about it. No opportunity for advancement unless you have been preselected by management so there’s not point in going through the process. Union. You are forced to be part of the union since they are unionized. And their union includes seniority system which is the worst system ever. Because senior will always be priority even if they ARE BAD at their jobs. Seniority rules doesn't motivate new employee to work harder because they will never get any benefit for doing a great job. Too many managers or leads and most of them don't know what they are doing. Company is too huge and you feel like you are just another replaceable employee. Never meet the CEO and doesn't make you feel like a family. Some people are fake-friendly as if that's part of the job requirement. Management can be great but it is typically hit or miss. Management does not always have team members backs, and many times will not take accountability for situations they put us in, so we end up getting scapegoated. The people that the higher ups promote are the ones that do not care at all about people but strictly numbers in my opinion Managers. No advancement unless you are a favorite by management. If you are looking for full-time, forget about it. Managers are always cutting jobs and are replacing full timers with part timers to avoid paying benefits. Managers have favorites. Only those get to move up to full-time. It's not about being a hard worker, it's about favoritism. Part timers are discriminated and treated like garbage by full timers and managers. Employee Representatives don't do anything to help their employees unless it's one of their favorites. When it comes to running Wegmans, money comes first, safety last. Business is always busy, but the departments are very shorthanded. Managers do this in order to save money. With few employees in various departments, they are being asked to perform double or triple the work. Managers criticized them for not working fast enough. Everyone is scared to do their job right. The job can be physically demanding with a majority of your shift staying on your feet. On store level they want you to have an open availability. Makes it hard to work a second job if you want to support yourself without any assistance. As a lower level manager my pay is good compared to competitors I believe but for me to pay rent in my area and have a car that is reliable I need to take the extra step higher which is unfortunate because even at lower level management I have had enough stress from the job that I lost sleep. I have seen managers retaliate when an employee was expressing to leave which upset me. Company says they care about their people and should fine when someone makes an important decision to better themselves. No options for remote work if you want to move up into corporate.Downsides, it’s a really fast-paced environment, at times, there were no downtime Makes me expect more from future jobs Some of the management are not that great.

Never meet the CEO and doesn't make you feel like a family. They say family but no family atmosphere in the store Some of the shifts are late shifts, but managers work with you on availability. Some people are fake-friendly as if that's part of the job requirement. Hours - all retail positions, especially in the grocery world, are going to come with a variety of shifts throughout the week. That is my only con. Really not that many consDownsides, it’s a really fast-paced environment, at times, there were no downtime Makes me expect more from future jobs Some of the management are not that great. Some of the team leads should not be in that position. As they are unable to handle difficult conversations or choose not to do anything about a complaint you may have. There is no real reward in our department for doing a great job or going above and beyond. So departments though so reward their people with care card gift certificates but that is based on what your direct management wants to do for the bakery we never get any. You are only talked to when they want to complain about something you did. In the last few years the company has become more profit driven and as a result just isn’t concerned with the lives of their worker anymore. They do nice things like bbqs and food in the break room but if you are seriously Ill and out of work for weeks, no one will care. You won’t get even on call or text. If you have a condition that keep you in pain everyday and come to work and do your job regardless and do a good job, don’t expect management to ever ask how you’re doing or how you’re treatments are going because they don’t care. The younger team leaders will care and ask, but that’s about it. No opportunity for advancement unless you have been preselected by management so there’s not point in going through the process. Union. You are forced to be part of the union since they are unionized. And their union includes seniority system which is the worst system ever.

Never meet the CEO and doesn't make you feel like a family. Some people are fake-friendly as if that's part of the job requirement. Management can be great but it is typically hit or miss. Management does not always have team members backs, and many times will not take accountability for situations they put us in, so we end up getting scapegoated. The people that the higher ups promote are the ones that do not care at all about people but strictly numbers in my opinion Managers. No advancement unless you are a favorite by management. If you are looking for full-time, forget about it. Managers are always cutting jobs and are replacing full timers with part timers to avoid paying benefits. Managers have favorites. Only those get to move up to full-time. It's not about being a hard worker, it's about favoritism. Part timers are discriminated and treated like garbage by full timers and managers. Employee Representatives don't do anything to help their employees unless it's one of their favorites. When it comes to running Wegmans, money comes first, safety last. Business is always busy, but the departments are very shorthanded. Managers do this in order to save money. With few employees in various departments, they are being asked to perform double or triple the work. Managers criticized them for not working fast enough. Everyone is scared to do their job right. The job can be physically demanding with a majority of your shift staying on your feet. On store level they want you to have an open availability. Makes it hard to work a second job if you want to support yourself without any assistance. As a lower level manager my pay is good compared to competitors I believe but for me to pay rent in my area and have a car that is reliable I need to take the extra step higher which is unfortunate because even at lower level management I have had enough stress from the job that I lost sleep. I have seen managers retaliate when an employee was expressing to leave which upset me. Company says they care about their people and should fine when someone makes an important decision to better themselves. No options for remote work if you want to move up into corporate."

I have a disability which makes it difficult for me to stand for extended periods of time. It also requires that I drink excessive amounts of water with added electrolytes. I was unable to have my 64oz stainless steel water bottle even after getting a note from my doctor stating that it was necessary, and the company made me get my other accommodations (no standing for more than 30 minutes) changed just so I could work. Although there is no policy stating that cashiers cannot sit, they were unwilling to allow me to stay in the position I was hired for (cashier) because a chair or stool would be a ""trip hazard"" and would not let me sign something saying I would not sue the company if I tripped because it was also a concern relating to customers, but there is no reason that a customer should be that close to the register. Instead of working with me and accommodating my reasonable requirements (allowing me to have my 64oz water bottle, allowing me to sit for ~30 minutes, etc), Meijer chose to change my position and give me a rollator (walker) - which I didn't receive until over two and a half hours into my last shift. Instead of working with my reasonable accommodations, Meijer put me on leave while waiting for updated accommodations from my doctor, then they changed my position from a cashier to a general merchandise clerk. No balance. You have sick time they don’t tell you about so you don’t use it as a salary worker. Once you learn something in a new department they always expect it from you. No real follow up with leaders. Can be transferred to another store or another position on a whim, you get no say. If you were to discipline your staff for tardies or call offs the way they want you to, you would have no staff, you have to make your own boundaries on that. Too many systems and processes to hire, discipline, schedule, etc. Ridiculously long training process that don’t actually help train what is needed for the role. In my particular position (working mostly in the back room), a lot of blame for efficiency fell onto my team. management can be lacking in certain areas Strict time on when you start your work day, but that's my only issue and it's not really a problem. No matter which Meijer you work at, it seems that the deli always suffers the most. A word of advice: if you apply and they ask you to work in the deli, you can give them an emphatic NO.

More senior management positions were created/hired outside of the organization or from other SAIC contracts instead of from within this contract. This was at a time where the organization needed more hands on personnel vice chiefs. Managing customer expectations or agreeing to everything the customer thought they wanted at a moment's notice without any plan of action became annoying a huge point of contention. Being told ""you are not paid to think. you are paid to do what you are told"" when bringing up a concern that could have negatively impacted our highest concentration of VIPs did little to garner trust that upper management of the program had a firm grasp on this key responsibility of senior management. - In terms of benefits especially health coverage, I think SAIC can do more to improve not just the overall coverage, but the cost as well.Nothing beyond the usual amount of paperwork in order to fulfill obligations and tracking of products/jobs. I have no cons with SAIC. Limited Autonomy: Working in a company often means adhering to established policies, procedures, and hierarchies. This can limit your autonomy and decision-making authority, requiring you to follow guidelines set by management. Office Politics: Companies are made up of diverse individuals with different perspectives and motivations. Office politics and internal conflicts can sometimes arise, affecting workplace dynamics and potentially causing stress or tension. Lack of Flexibility: Some companies may have rigid work schedules and limited flexibility in terms of working hours or remote work options. This can pose challenges for individuals who prefer more flexible arrangements or have personal obligations that require flexibility. Since you are a subcontractor, the pay is not the best, but you do get benefits. It is a very fast paced environment & can be stressful. They use more of a 'baptism by fire"" training method. You get 3 weeks of training how to create tickets, and they sometimes have learning sessions, but you will feel like you were just dumped in without a safety net. If you plan to apply for this job, get you Security + first. That will allow you to obtain admin rights, which is so much better than having to ask a team leader everything. Do not be late to work or leave early, even one minute early. They really pay attention to attendance. Get there early to have time to get your computer started, because you have to be on the phone at the time you are scheduled. VERY hard to advance your career. Not many remote positions, and any that are available are already taken by employees that the requirements are tailored to. If you're looking to advance up a ladder, good luck. If you have a family, you should probably look elsewhere. The pay starting out is great, but keep in mind, the contract you're working on has a set amount for yearly increases. You won't get paid more if you do better work than anyone else, it'll be dependent on the contract. Bonuses are communicated when signing on, but they're non-existent. They're for the Program directors and above. Also the PTO is terrible. Starting out you have 2 weeks of PTO. Good luck if you have a family and want to take time off for vacations or even catching a baseball game or golf on a nice day. Keep in mind, you're working mostly with the government, so when they say jump, and you ask how high, they'll answer you 3 months later, but wanted your jump done 4 months earlier. In person on naval base, security and traffic daily The ISSAIC portal needs a lot of improvement, Thats about it. But I am biased because I am a web developer.

The environment is similar to high school. Constant drama and criticism. Fights in office. Upper management was looking into cutting down lunch from 1 hr to 30 minutes.

It’s very difficult to find a decent paying assignment. I don't really have any. I understood the terms of my employment & I was ok with it.

Northside Hospital is a great place to work, and I hope I finish my career here. The northside I work at is amazing. I have a great management team and amazing coworkers that feel like family. Hospital like can be stressful but the people I work with make it all worth while Lots of work to keep you busy, medical staff appreciates the in house interpreters. Felt very valued/needed. Worked with two different managers during my time there and the previous manager was more focused on personal relationships rather than overall operations, felt like there was no structure or rules to follow with so much personal drama being brought into work, when the new manager came in she inherited a mess. But the last few years before I left there was a drastic difference in the environment I felt like it was a much healthier environment to work in and much more structured. Lots of more acknowledgment from the management, management started collecting more feedback from the team about the day to day operations. Taking PTO started becoming much easier.

Our department's schedule flexibility allows us to have a work-life balance.

I have been presented with opportunities to learn and grow from one position to the next. It is an awesome place to work for and I love my co-workers. Northside is definitely my home away from home. great atmosphere, flexible schedule, great staff","More communication between management and staff. 12 hr shifts, working weekends and holidays The pay rate when I first started was amazing compared to other hospitals but I left mainly because of how bad the pay rate became, every other hospital pays at least $7 more per hour compared to this hospital. The business office is ran like a plantation. I worked MANDATORY overtime 95% of the time I was there including Saturdays and Sundays. No matter what department, if you work in the business office, you WILL be working mandatory OT. Your PTO request will be denied (even for doctor's appointments) because they are always understaffed due to people quitting. The Alt Right managers and directors have a superiority complex and they look down on the staff (depending on what you look like). They go out or their way to be disrespectful. The supervisors are flunkies who do the dirty work of upper mgmt. You will get finger pointing, petty emails and Skype messages. And your supervisor and team leads will nag you the whole day at the behest of management. My supervisor never stopped harassing me even though I always met production and goals. The job is remote but you will ALWAYS be threatened to have to come in the office for any so-called infraction. There is no work life balance what so ever. You WILL be doing the work of 2 or 3 people due to understaffing. You will always be on mandatory overtime including weekends. They will throw ""special projects"" on you with a crazy deadlines at any give moment. This will be on top of your regular work. For anyone that works there, make sure you get regular check ups because the stress will kill you slowly! The Coordinator and manager (and directors) are liars and bigots! Good riddance to that place. Career advancements and promotional opportunities are limited. Little room for growth; they care more about productivity than patient care (this is a systemic problem though in healthcare); they do not care about loyalty whatsoever; hire more new grads and just seem to want bodies more so than quality care for the patients The pay is as little as possible no matter how much experience you have in the field you are applying for. Even if you have worked for a similar office and know the ins and outs of everything that needs to be done, they still try and low ball you. As a former employee with direct knowledge of how things are ran in that office, i can say this.. The manager there is trying to do the best she can under the circumstances however, It is very obvious to all, the Director there is who is running the show. How can someone, anyone be able to be an effective manager there when she has a micromanager director breathing down her neck every second and is using her as HER escape goat to do her ""dirty"" job ? She (the director) goes to bad for the few people she likes and to bow to her while throwing trash and not caring for anyone she does not see worthy of her. One more thing. Pay there is a joke, There was a time when salary was competitive. Now, any other place for the job, pays much better. They stopped using their PRN staff a while back. They should have increased their full time staff the salary the prn's were making which is close to what a good interpreter is making these days. Lack of communication amongst management. Raises are not enough for the job.More communication between management and staff. 12 hr shifts, working weekends and holidays The pay rate when I first started was amazing compared to other hospitals but I left mainly because of how bad the pay rate became, every other hospital pays at least $7 more per hour compared to this hospital. Career advancements and promotional opportunities are limited. The business office is ran like a plantation. I worked MANDATORY overtime 95% of the time I was there including Saturdays and Sundays. No matter what department, if you work in the business office, you WILL be working mandatory OT. Your PTO request will be denied (even for doctor's appointments) because they are always understaffed due to people quitting. The Alt Right managers and directors have a superiority complex and they look down on the staff (depending on what you look like). They go out or their way to be disrespectful. The supervisors are flunkies who do the dirty work of upper mgmt. You will get finger pointing, petty emails and Skype messages. And your supervisor and team leads will nag you the whole day at the behest of management. My supervisor never stopped harassing me even though I always met production and goals. The job is remote but you will ALWAYS be threatened to have to come in the office for any so-called infraction. There is no work life balance what so ever. You WILL be doing the work of 2 or 3 people due to understaffing. You will always be on mandatory overtime including weekends. They will throw ""special projects"" on you with a crazy deadlines at any give moment. This will be on top of your regular work. For anyone that works there, make sure you get regular check ups because the stress will kill you slowly! The Coordinator and manager (and directors) are liars and bigots! Good riddance to that place. Little room for growth; they care more about productivity than patient care (this is a systemic problem though in healthcare); they do not care about loyalty whatsoever; hire more new grads and just seem to want bodies more so than quality care for the patients None really I enjoyed working here The pay is as little as possible no matter how much experience you have in the field you are applying for. Even if you have worked for a similar office and know the ins and outs of everything that needs to be done, they still try and low ball you.

I like my team, but not everyone would. Find the right fit for you. KW as a whole has a lot of great resources and free classes, which is nice if you're new to the business. You can also get your real estate license for free if you go through them, you don't even have to join.

As a company as a whole, they seem to really support their real estate agents. Many of the offices are well-run and have really nice people. Most of the real estate agents and a lot of the office staff I met were friendly and fun to work with. They have good options for their workers to make both direct and indirect income, such as through referrals. I work for a team within KW and the biggest thing I've learned is that each team and agent you work with is very different and has their own way of doing things. I like my team, but not everyone would. Find the right fit for you. KW as a whole has a lot of great resources and free classes, which is nice if you're new to the business. You can also get your real estate license for free if you go through them, you don't even have to join. The culture is the key PAY AND FLEXBILITY OF TIME Flexible work schedule and get to work for yourself","can't think of anything bad to say because I did enjoy my time with KW While Keller Williams Realty offers many benefits, some agents are detoured from joining by the commission split which could be revised. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons to determine if KW is the right fit for your goals. I felt like at my office specifically, I wasn't really well liked by the people directly in charge of me. It seemed like they never really wanted me there and just hired me out of a desperate need. I had originally applied for a real estate agent position, and they encouraged me to apply for the DFI role, only to make me feel kind of forced into leaving within a couple of months. This KW office's leadership seems to have good intentions, but they could certainly do better. New agents are left with little to no guidance. Ever since Covid, the office seems to have lost its sense of community and culture that they're constantly preaching. There's more focus on getting new agents in the door than keeping and nurturing the ones they already have. Wish I could increase my commission split. Been working here for over two years but they make it hard to increase split. Felt like one size fits all, get a bunch of bodies through the door. Some of the technology that was used when I was there was first rolling out so there were some glitches, but once that gets figured out, it will be wonderful! Agents must manage all aspects of their business, from lead generation to administrative tasks. Keller Williams agents are often responsible for their own expenses, including marketing, advertising, and other business costs. This can be challenging for agents who prefer a brokerage that covers a more significant portion of these expenses. The commission split until you cap is pretty steep. 64% only? ( compare to 80% of others? and....if you use referrals you will only have less than 29% profit and on top of it pay 400 dollars for the transaction coordinator... THEY ONLY MAKE MONEY AND YOU DO THE HARD STRESSING WORK! They flag their training...it is the worst training you can have. They will not help you when you need them. They will not share their leads with you...they have their private offices.... THEY ARE RATED HIGHLY BECAUSE THE GOOD MARKETING THEY ARE DOING FOR THEMSELVES!!!!

Associates are appreciated. They take care of their employees and provide the best senior care available anywhere. My coworkers were cool. The did pretty ok at keeping us staffed. It was better than other assisted livings or SNFs with 1 person per 8-14 people usually. They had a nice office and atmosphere. Barley any people in office, so its pretty nice and quiet. Hours Pay Advancement opportunities Management outlook Free food Excellent training, resources and best practices create an environment that sets high standards. Residents and families, flexible work schedule Great staff to work around and awesome residents who don't like being there. I would have never thought Id again be truly happy in working within Senior facilities. Especially post covid, and having been in travel nursing contracts just to avoid seeing so many deplorable places. This is by far Hands Down- THE BEST Senior Care Facility Ive ever worked in. Im honored wearing my Brookdale shirt! Its so clean and organized and systematically run so well from Top Management to my Co Workers. Professional and compassionate care is constantly being given from every level here. Everyone pitches in! My shifts are now a joy to work. Its steady and very busy most days- but the difference is in the faces of those who work or live here , the smiles, the effort put fourth in the Teamwork- and HAPPY CONTENT SENIORS that is the best indicator. The overall culture is amazing, strong benefit package, flexibility in schedules, plenty of opportunity for growth.The benefits are amazing!

Wonderful Residents to spend time with. I have learned so much from them. What better job to have than to come to work and hang out with wonderful, bright - always wanting to learn and do more - ""friends"" The staff here is friendly and easy to work with too - an added plus. During my short tenur with this company, the leadership and Regional Team were excellent supporters of the different divisons and community locations within their company. They acknowledged excellent performance and invested in thier employees. I love working with my residents. I love the support I receive from my manager. I love the autonomy I have to plan my own schedule and goto what community I most needed in.","I honestly can't think of anything bad to say. Lots of exposure to people passing away. Every once in a while you would be left for a few hours without help until they got scheduling figured out. Management was good up until right when I quit. When I was hired I asked them about my nose ring (standard small hoop. Skin colored) and they said it would be no issue. Then months later they had us start covering tattoos and piercings with bandaids??? I was already going back to school so I phased out. There was no support from supervisors for the role. They had not idea how certain applications worked and could not help with common simple issues that arose. Did not notify team when changes will occur. Losing residents you've made a relationship with (Huge con) Seeing residents families not give their loved ones the respect and love they deserve. Not everyone shares the desire to give 110%, or even show up in this industry these days and management slow to address, like so many HR depts these days. Unfortunately, it discourages those who ARE giving it their all. Corporate MUST vet its management better. You may want to make the interview process more rigorous or their probationary period longer. Your leaders are driving away your direct care ( in both nursing and culinary) employees. Many of them do not understand teamwork and the concept of leaders eating last. If you watch out for your employees then they will watch out for you. Unfortunately, my experience in year's time showed me how someone's communication skills and lack of teamwork can run a place into the ground. In my opinion, management all the way up are incompetent. They don't pay bills so they have to look around for those who do services. They are disrespectful to residents as I've seen them yell at multiple residents. Staff is expendable. Residents are just money. Youll gain a few pounds! The deserts are Fabulous! The PTO time could be better, but the culture and flexibility makes up for it.I honestly can't think of anything bad to say. Lots of exposure to people passing away.

Working so close everyday to these wonderful residents - they become your friends... and when life comes to an end -- you feel bless they were part of your life but it's still hard. Sometimes the front line staff is overlooked. Sometimes the support in the communities is poor. Lack of private work space to work in some communities. Paper charts and EMR systems make it difficult to see lab results ect. on resident in a community other than the one your working in."

You will fail if you are looking to sit around and wait for things to happen. You have to work hard to make opportunities. Mostly commission based pay- a lot of turnover Not a 40 hour week 100% commission. You need to HUSTLE for your money. You might get commission kickbacks, as your pay is tied to people following their entire sales funnel. If you do not have a lot of individuals in your network, you will struggle. need to be good at time management - Commission based compensation structure, which may be stressful for some.

Culture inclusion within the company","Saas is hard and a lot of people give up Started out as a great job but the last year has gone downhill. Management and HR are blind. I was pushed onto a team to “clean it up” and now can’t escape it. Length of device and exceptional work mean nothing. Less than ethical practices are rewarded and the ones that actually work are forced to do the work of those who don’t “for the team”. Never thought I would leave but am now searching for a new job. When I hit 5 years I was hounded to submit a good review. Really? Desperate? Treat people right and you would not have to do that. Isn’t the mass exodus telling you anything? You should know it is cheaper to keep the good ones instead of hiring and training new ones. Attempting to move to other departments is only for the friends of management. Quality of work is not considered but the ability to self promote is. Do you want capable people or sales people? In the department, the advancement comes through mostly a title change with little change to actual compensation. After a certain point it is actually entirely just a number added to your title and nothing more. Ideas seem to come mostly top down, and not bottom up. We continue to lose our experienced specialists and leaders to better compensated departments and companies, even if the jobs themselves aren't really better, which hurts our resource pool. It also creates an uneasy feeling withing the department which tends to create a negative atmosphere. At this time, I have not observed any downsides to working at Paycom. The initial training was vague and confusing. Training & ongoing process documentation was unbelievably bad (typos, clarity, consistency, even locating). After training the trend of getting vague and confusing answers to questions about job duties and processes continued. No one really seemed to know what they were doing and couldn't help anyone else figure out how to do things either. There were so many meetings and so much repetitive busy work there was not enough time to do your job. The expectation to work for even 10 customers at a time on top of 25 hours of meetings & busy work in a 40-hour week was impossible. The focus was more on pushing the company's preferred culture and the latest buzzwords. You were expected to do the work of someone who had been there the same amount of time but pay increases were based on spending weeks completing additional training that you did not have time to do after the first 3 months. So after a year, I was making the same as someone in training but with the same workload of a Level 3. The work is demanding in that you constantly have to adapt and learn new techniques and processes. Each client is different, each sales cycle is different, the Paycom system is constantly changing. It is a lot to keep up with, but my manager and team constantly provide ways they're making life easier. The focus of the company and our department can change rapidly, so being adaptable is a must. There will be new reports to fill out or objectives to hit, so understanding what is important and when to complete it by is crucial for survival. There is not enough time in the day. Toxic wolf of wall street type of fear based sales organization. The running joke is ""yeah I'm getting fired"" for this or that. Miserable place to work, constant stress and pressure. If you're young and single it could be worth a shot but if you seriously depend on a job and you have a family to support and they want to see you and care about your well-being, literally look anywhere else. Zero organization when it comes to projects, however it is hard for things to stay organized whenever you can hardly keep project managers hired. Even then they still do little to lead meetings. People are hardly ever on the same page because lots of communication is rarely put in writing. Everyone is burnt out from being overworked. When upper management wants something done they want it done ASAP but don't give teams enough time leading to faulty items being put out but then they still get mad at teams even though they didn't get enough time. There is almost no work life balance if you are put on a team that has a spotlight on it. There is a reason why most new hires are recent college grads, everyone else in the area knows better. Pay is also not great compared to other similar jobs. No hybrid options, zero flexibility, and you will get nickel and dimed for PTO for something as simple as a dentist appointment. You will also be micromanaged in pretty much every aspect of your job. As this is a very fast-paced company it's important to be agile due changes that can happen daily and/or hourly. You will need to stretch yourself each day to keep up with the pace and professionals around you. The job responsibilities are ever changing.

Benefits package is below market if you are carrying additional dependents Upper management is out of touch with the workforce needs and feedback loops RTO policies are antiquated for a technology company Inexpensive (4$) lunch meals are subpar in quality High turnover volume has made job executions more difficult over time Knee jerk reactions from the top create a chaotic environment for individuals at the ground level resulting in moving target objectives, unrealistic deadlines, and an overall feeling of instability Fear based leadership and micromanagement are common themes Company is outwardly marketed as a Technology workplace but treated inside as Sales and Operational workforce as a whole Lack of flexibility across departments and subgroups to create policies and change that promote a healthy working environment. One size fits all blanketed policies Our entire company strategy is to placate the egos of upper management. Everyone is terrified of our CEO, and nobody has the confidence to tell him what the real problems are because they’re afraid they’ll lose their high paying job. We’re hiding information from him every week, and then running after what he thinks needs to be done. When things don’t go well it’s the lower level people that get fired or lose bonuses. This leaves you in constant fear of your job and uncertain about the future of the company. At this time, I have not observed any downsides to working at Paycom. They do not listen to their employees. The pay is not enough for what is expected for the job. Gallup surveys are released to employees and if employees rate negatively, team leaders are then talked with that they are not doing their job when it’s actually supervisors and management specialist employees are frustrated with not team leaders but gallups are not allowing employees to express frustrations against the correct people that they are mad at. The Hub, where tax is currently working at is disgusting and not workable conditions. The food is making people sick, they have to work in loud noises and gross smells daily. This department is excluded from any headquarter events and is the department that is paid the lowest but they are why clients come to Paycom for which is to have their taxes filed for them.Saas is hard and a lot of people give up Started out as a great job but the last year has gone downhill.

When I hit 5 years I was hounded to submit a good review. Really? Desperate? Treat people right and you would not have to do that. Isn’t the mass exodus telling you anything? You should know it is cheaper to keep the good ones instead of hiring and training new ones. Attempting to move to other departments is only for the friends of management. Quality of work is not considered but the ability to self promote is. Do you want capable people or sales people? In the department, the advancement comes through mostly a title change with little change to actual compensation. After a certain point it is actually entirely just a number added to your title and nothing more. Ideas seem to come mostly top down, and not bottom up. We continue to lose our experienced specialists and leaders to better compensated departments and companies, even if the jobs themselves aren't really better, which hurts our resource pool. It also creates an uneasy feeling withing the department which tends to create a negative atmosphere. At this time, I have not observed any downsides to working at Paycom. The initial training was vague and confusing. Training & ongoing process documentation was unbelievably bad (typos, clarity, consistency, even locating). After training the trend of getting vague and confusing answers to questions about job duties and processes continued. No one really seemed to know what they were doing and couldn't help anyone else figure out how to do things either. There were so many meetings and so much repetitive busy work there was not enough time to do your job. The expectation to work for even 10 customers at a time on top of 25 hours of meetings & busy work in a 40-hour week was impossible. The focus was more on pushing the company's preferred culture and the latest buzzwords. You were expected to do the work of someone who had been there the same amount of time but pay increases were based on spending weeks completing additional training that you did not have time to do after the first 3 months. So after a year, I was making the same as someone in training but with the same workload of a Level 3. The work is demanding in that you constantly have to adapt and learn new techniques and processes. Each client is different, each sales cycle is different, the Paycom system is constantly changing. It is a lot to keep up with, but my manager and team constantly provide ways they're making life easier. The focus of the company and our department can change rapidly, so being adaptable is a must. There will be new reports to fill out or objectives to hit, so understanding what is important and when to complete it by is crucial for survival. There is not enough time in the day. Toxic wolf of wall street type of fear based sales organization. The running joke is ""yeah I'm getting fired"" for this or that. Miserable place to work, constant stress and pressure. If you're young and single it could be worth a shot but if you seriously depend on a job and you have a family to support and they want to see you and care about your well-being, literally look anywhere else. Zero organization when it comes to projects, however it is hard for things to stay organized whenever you can hardly keep project managers hired. Even then they still do little to lead meetings. People are hardly ever on the same page because lots of communication is rarely put in writing. Everyone is burnt out from being overworked. When upper management wants something done they want it done ASAP but don't give teams enough time leading to faulty items being put out but then they still get mad at teams even though they didn't get enough time. There is almost no work life balance if you are put on a team that has a spotlight on it. There is a reason why most new hires are recent college grads, everyone else in the area knows better. Pay is also not great compared to other similar jobs. No hybrid options, zero flexibility, and you will get nickel and dimed for PTO for something as simple as a dentist appointment. You will also be micromanaged in pretty much every aspect of your job. As this is a very fast-paced company it's important to be agile due changes that can happen daily and/or hourly. You will need to stretch yourself each day to keep up with the pace and professionals around you. The job responsibilities are ever changing. Lots of initiatives that are sometimes hard to keep track of.Saas is hard and a lot of people give up Started out as a great job but the last year has gone downhill. Management and HR are blind.

Indeed twas a time spent verry agressive culture overall. managment could have been better Low end of salary scale for the industry Micro-managing more than what is reasonable. Ability to promote and grow, but no support or mentorship within the role once you're there. Unrealistic targets and metrics, no consideration for staff individual strengths if not fitting the metric mould. Uneven pay equity. Below industry standard, unequal across roles for similar experience and backgrounds. Uneven pay distribution. Lack of consistent messages from leaders and leaders are not on the same page. When a decision is made and rolled out to staff, anticipate the message changing multiple times and to be delivered with urgent turnaround. Expectations to be available after hours and on call without compensation. Outdated annual review structure. Next to impossible to be recognized for performing above expectations and next to no compensation for those contributions, other than to be expected to do more in coming years. Unnecessary amount of workload.. let's start here... You don't get credit for all they expect you to do for ""metrics"" . The expectations for the position is ridiculously unrealistic and they continue to add requirements for ""state contract""... I just quit and joined another competitor which simplified its workload for it's employees. FOR THE SAME STATE. Lol.. and contract satisfaction. Turnover rate is EXTREMELY high and retention for new employees in case management department is very low. they can't keep anyone. they penalize you for lack of assessment completion which has ZERO to do with you and more often to do with members being unable to reach. Health benefits are bogus to be so ""high on the Fortune 500 list"" last i checked they stopped bonuses every year now. Applied for 37-40 internal positions and did not get a single one. even with a spotless record regarding work performance and no disciplinary action, leading me to believe they will bottleneck you into being stuck on a team where you can't transfer if they really need employees for that department but they won't tell you. no exit interview upon resignation. just a crappy company. good for couple years experience and bounce. health insurance options are poor. holidays are few and far and in between. accrual based pto is mediocre. bad middle managers. micromanaging metrics. they expect employees to be working every second even though studies show microbreaks are better and actually improve efficiency. every hour is tracked. every minute is tracked. every second is tracked. bonuses aren't elaborated on and if you got hired too close to the bonus, you won't get it anyway so ignore whatever bonus they're trying to sell you on when considering to work here. middle managers care more about defending dodgey practices and processes than actually making improvements. time is wasted literally talking about how a set number of out going calls didn't happen. they want you making 6 outgoing calls an hour. System problems? too bad. Long calls that need interpreters? too bad. difficult members? too bad. you'll need to document every reason you didn't hit that number. they care more about the numbers they can put on their resume than the turnover dollars they are costing the business. if you can jump when they say jump and be a good lap dog, you'll be just fine. No job is perfect, but phone stats required are unrealistic; probably due to ones who felt remote work meant slacking, which ruined it for us who actually sit at our desk the entire time working. 20 wk training was hit or miss w/topics requiring more knowledge.

Quality and AHT are the main things to focus on. Adherence is crucial. Members are part of an under-served demographic which brings on its own set of unique challenges. No policy protecting reps from from verbally abusive callers. When I started, we were responsible for handling calls for Aetna Better Health of Texas, and Parkland Community Health Plan, which is a Medicaid plan funded in part by Parkland Hospital, a large hospital in Dallas, TX. Towards the end of my time there, Member Services was slapped with a new policy requiring us to handle calls for Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and Florida. We had a two hour training to prepare us for this huge undertaking as each state has its own specific rules for handling and documenting calls. This was a disaster to say the least. Provider network calls were a huge source of contention and frustration as we were expected to provide members with doctors in their network. This sounds reasonable enough, but not so much when the company has not bothered to update the provider directory FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS!!! This made the directory pretty much useless and nearly impossible to assist the member with finding a provider who was accepting new patients. We were also expected to confirm with the provider that they were by placing an outbound call. We were required to provide at least three, while driving our AHT up exponentially. If the member was trying to find a specialist, the offerings were even more slim. We were also expected to schedule appointments for the members as well. I disagreed wholeheartedly with this practice, as I feel that barring some sort of condition or disability (if this is the case, then someone else should be making your appointments anyway),all adults should be making their own doctors appointments. In addition to that, we were expected to direct the member to various community resources like WIC, where to get car seats and breast pumps for free, food banks and shelters, etc, and to keep track of the incentive programs offered by the plan itself. We were also expected to do this for the out of state plans as well. It was extremely difficult trying to direct someone to a place in a state I am not familiar with. Additionally, these resources were subject to frequent changes which only added to the frustration and stress when we would get calls back from angry members when they weren't able to take advantage of a resource that we directed them to. Every week, there was something else we were required to do on our calls with no increase in the AHT requirement. Do more in less time. After working remotely for a few months, there was talk of going back to the office which I was not interested in doing. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Oh, and tuition reimbursement is offered, but it is nearly impossible to get as they play games and make you jump through hoops to get it, and if you actually do get it, it's not what they initially said it would be, further adding to stress and frustration, and depression in some cases. They tell you that you can apply for jobs in other departments or a higher position in your own department after a year, but the truth is nobody ever really gets promoted or transferred to a different department. Summing everything up, if you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you don't have a job, by all means go for it, because something is better than nothing, but make it a point to keep applying for other positions in the meantime, because there is better out there.

No policy protecting reps from from verbally abusive callers. When I started, we were responsible for handling calls for Aetna Better Health of Texas, and Parkland Community Health Plan, which is a Medicaid plan funded in part by Parkland Hospital, a large hospital in Dallas, TX. Towards the end of my time there, Member Services was slapped with a new policy requiring us to handle calls for Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and Florida. We had a two hour training to prepare us for this huge undertaking as each state has its own specific rules for handling and documenting calls. This was a disaster to say the least. Provider network calls were a huge source of contention and frustration as we were expected to provide members with doctors in their network. This sounds reasonable enough, but not so much when the company has not bothered to update the provider directory FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS!!! This made the directory pretty much useless and nearly impossible to assist the member with finding a provider who was accepting new patients. We were also expected to confirm with the provider that they were by placing an outbound call. We were required to provide at least three, while driving our AHT up exponentially. If the member was trying to find a specialist, the offerings were even more slim. We were also expected to schedule appointments for the members as well. I disagreed wholeheartedly with this practice, as I feel that barring some sort of condition or disability (if this is the case, then someone else should be making your appointments anyway),all adults should be making their own doctors appointments. In addition to that, we were expected to direct the member to various community resources like WIC, where to get car seats and breast pumps for free, food banks and shelters, etc, and to keep track of the incentive programs offered by the plan itself. We were also expected to do this for the out of state plans as well. It was extremely difficult trying to direct someone to a place in a state I am not familiar with. Additionally, these resources were subject to frequent changes which only added to the frustration and stress when we would get calls back from angry members when they weren't able to take advantage of a resource that we directed them to. Every week, there was something else we were required to do on our calls with no increase in the AHT requirement. Do more in less time. After working remotely for a few months, there was talk of going back to the office which I was not interested in doing. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Oh, and tuition reimbursement is offered, but it is nearly impossible to get as they play games and make you jump through hoops to get it, and if you actually do get it, it's not what they initially said it would be, further adding to stress and frustration, and depression in some cases. They tell you that you can apply for jobs in other departments or a higher position in your own department after a year, but the truth is nobody ever really gets promoted or transferred to a different department. Summing everything up, if you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you don't have a job, by all means go for it, because something is better than nothing, but make it a point to keep applying for other positions in the meantime, because there is better out there.

I've had BSWH insurance most of my life, and the brief period of time where I didn't, I really wished I did. Dental and vision are available. They recently added tuition reimbursement. BSWH also recently partnered with Lyra for mental health assistance. My supervisor and lab manager are great people though. They advocate for us when they can and try their best to help us as much as possible. Most people are pleasant to work with. Good PTO.

Good benefits with the option to work remotely","Nothing at this time. Very good company Very few I can think of. Ever since new CEO Roger H took over in 2017, there have been unprecedented number of executive exits. Shocked to see so many senior level leadership forced out by Roger, especially when he was the #2 person in the company for 15+ years before taking over as the CEO. Org changes every few months and everyone talks about how now change is the only constant. Board is also almost brand new with most having started within the last 2-3 years. Company seems to have lost its way ever since Roger took over the reigns. Started this Journey with this company!! I felt valued and was excited about the job until that feeling wore off. Day one we had a wonderful intro to the company was told that we were valued and that we were family . going through the milestones each trainer had a different technique . Our First trainer was the only competent one within the company! after completing the last step to transition into core. The company told us we were being moved with a team meeting with me and my peers! Told us that we had no *SAY* due to a overstaffing issue with being in training we were tossed into a5 week training! GET THIS.. the trainer for our classes was thrown into training us and was not a DEPARTMENT TRAINER!! THE SYSTEMS ARE SLOW and Not something you are wanting to deal with on the daily! -I was let go in a 5 min meeting with my TL and HR rep! I was not warned about any misconduct only the conversation of being laid off. there has been no communication between the company and I . **THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE!! STAY AWAY! Benefits are sketchy for older workers starting there. For instance a formula had to work a number of years before age 50 I think it is to be eligible for retirement insurance. There is no retirement plan for new employees. Retirement pay for existing workers was frozen a decade ago so doesn’t increase. After 10 years of service benefits don’t increase as much. Even less so for 15 and twenty years service. The HR doesn’t tailor benefits for employee sectors like tech to be competitive with other tech companies yet want to recruit the best and brightest tech. Discover doesn’t let eligible employees keep their company policy and get Medicare Part B. Would save Discover a lot of money as Medicare is then primary. Nor does HR offer any group Medicare supplement plans. The dental insurance even the premium plan only allows x-rays once a year. They don’t keep their word. Change teams and Team leaders to often - They work in agile, but the company removed the Scrum Master role. So, the PO works as a Product Owner, Scrum Master, Project Manager, and needs to display Product Manager skills if you want to advance with the organization. - They work in water-gile. No PI Planning, but you will meet five times a week to discuss the same thing and receive updates. Why!? This is essentially waterfall. - Remote employees have 0 opportunity to advance after level 8. This isn't public knowledge but I believe this will make most remote team members resign and the company can avoid layoffs. They truly want everyone back in the office. - Most of the leaders didn't earn the position. They received promotions and they are learning as they go. As an individual contributor, you can feel it. Accepting this position was probably the biggest mistake of my career. Leadership eliminated it’s flexible work arrangements and has mandated a return to office policy. The CEO has been clear that he “doesn’t believe in work life balance” and is tasking leaders to micromanage employees by tracking badge-ins. While I personally wasn’t impacted, it put me in a position to lead my team with a “do as I say, not as I do” approach which I was not aligned with. As a remote employee, I didn’t feel like I’d have the ability to grow my career unless I wanted to move to Riverwoods. In a new hire call, the CEO answered a career advancement question and stated that we’d most likely have better career opportunities if we were in the office. I had a terrible team leader, she never responded to emails, calls from her team. Every other week we had to experience a new team due to her negligence, “cough, cough” excuse me, her illnesses. If you are on a call and receive assistance from a manager, and the information given is incorrect you will receive a compliance(can lead to termination) and no consequences are given to that employee that has provided incorrect information. I received an email stating that employees CANNOT work extra hours, imagine a billion dollar industry denying employees to make extra money that have kids, bills etc. I was laid off by my team leader, whom I’ve only met with 3 times and each time she was uncomfortable and rushed through the meeting, until she told me I was being fired. I was fired for being over my pto 1 hour, forget the time and energy I’ve put into this company with 100% rating from customers. There is no room here for a black female who happens to be homosexual within this industry. Fortunately, I was able to be a groundbreaking employee whose mom just passed away and brought new clients to this god forsaken company. Thank you for allowing me to catapult into a better situation.Nothing at this time. Very good company Very few I can think of.

The CEO has been clear that he “doesn’t believe in work life balance” and is tasking leaders to micromanage employees by tracking badge-ins. While I personally wasn’t impacted, it put me in a position to lead my team with a “do as I say, not as I do” approach which I was not aligned with. As a remote employee, I didn’t feel like I’d have the ability to grow my career unless I wanted to move to Riverwoods. In a new hire call, the CEO answered a career advancement question and stated that we’d most likely have better career opportunities if we were in the office. I had a terrible team leader, she never responded to emails, calls from her team. Every other week we had to experience a new team due to her negligence, “cough, cough” excuse me, her illnesses. If you are on a call and receive assistance from a manager, and the information given is incorrect you will receive a compliance(can lead to termination) and no consequences are given to that employee that has provided incorrect information. I received an email stating that employees CANNOT work extra hours, imagine a billion dollar industry denying employees to make extra money that have kids, bills etc. I was laid off by my team leader, whom I’ve only met with 3 times and each time she was uncomfortable and rushed through the meeting, until she told me I was being fired. I was fired for being over my pto 1 hour, forget the time and energy I’ve put into this company with 100% rating from customers. There is no room here for a black female who happens to be homosexual within this industry. Fortunately, I was able to be a groundbreaking employee whose mom just passed away and brought new clients to this god forsaken company. Thank you for allowing me to catapult into a better situation. Everything from the top down as other reviews have posted about management and team leads. From the time i started with Discover to search for a better career path i quickly realized the mistake i had made by joining this company. The training i had was beyond confusing and their was a lot of miscommunication from the trainers and team leads who barely know the answer themselves. A lot of the time the TL’s are never working. They are always taking care of personal things on company time. “I hve to leave early today” like every day never there to support or grow or coach you like they claim they are there to be. They claim you can move up quickly at the company as a lot of people love sharing their story on how they made it. However its not as easy or as quick as they make it seem. Coming into this role over qualified i thought they would quickly notice my potential and ambitions but it goes unnoticed especially when I’m there answering questions and helping colleagues get the right answer. When excuses from management are, “sorry I’ve been busy today”. “Busy” should not be a word in your vocabulary as a people leaderNothing at this time. Very good company Very few I can think of. Ever since new CEO Roger H took over in 2017, there have been unprecedented number of executive exits. Shocked to see so many senior level leadership forced out by Roger, especially when he was the #2 person in the company for 15+ years before taking over as the CEO. Org changes every few months and everyone talks about how now change is the only constant. Board is also almost brand new with most having started within the last 2-3 years. Company seems to have lost its way ever since Roger took over the reigns. Started this Journey with this company!! I felt valued and was excited about the job until that feeling wore off. Day one we had a wonderful intro to the company was told that we were valued and that we were family . going through the milestones each trainer had a different technique . Our First trainer was the only competent one within the company! after completing the last step to transition into core. The company told us we were being moved with a team meeting with me and my peers! Told us that we had no *SAY* due to a overstaffing issue with being in training we were tossed into a5 week training! GET THIS.. the trainer for our classes was thrown into training us and was not a DEPARTMENT TRAINER!! THE SYSTEMS ARE SLOW and Not something you are wanting to deal with on the daily! -I was let go in a 5 min meeting with my TL and HR rep! I was not warned about any misconduct only the conversation of being laid off. there has been no communication between the company and I . **THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE!! STAY AWAY! They don’t keep their word. Benefits are sketchy for older workers starting there. For instance a formula had to work a number of years before age 50 I think it is to be eligible for retirement insurance. There is no retirement plan for new employees. Retirement pay for existing workers was frozen a decade ago so doesn’t increase. After 10 years of service benefits don’t increase as much. Even less so for 15 and twenty years service. The HR doesn’t tailor benefits for employee sectors like tech to be competitive with other tech companies yet want to recruit the best and brightest tech. Discover doesn’t let eligible employees keep their company policy and get Medicare Part B. Would save Discover a lot of money as Medicare is then primary. Nor does HR offer any group Medicare supplement plans. The dental insurance even the premium plan only allows x-rays once a year. - They work in agile, but the company removed the Scrum Master role. So, the PO works as a Product Owner, Scrum Master, Project Manager, and needs to display Product Manager skills if you want to advance with the organization. - They work in water-gile. No PI Planning, but you will meet five times a week to discuss the same thing and receive updates. Why!? This is essentially waterfall. - Remote employees have 0 opportunity to advance after level 8. This isn't public knowledge but I believe this will make most remote team members resign and the company can avoid layoffs.

In a new hire call, the CEO answered a career advancement question and stated that we’d most likely have better career opportunities if we were in the office. I had a terrible team leader, she never responded to emails, calls from her team. Every other week we had to experience a new team due to her negligence, “cough, cough” excuse me, her illnesses. If you are on a call and receive assistance from a manager, and the information given is incorrect you will receive a compliance(can lead to termination) and no consequences are given to that employee that has provided incorrect information. I received an email stating that employees CANNOT work extra hours, imagine a billion dollar industry denying employees to make extra money that have kids, bills etc. I was laid off by my team leader, whom I’ve only met with 3 times and each time she was uncomfortable and rushed through the meeting, until she told me I was being fired. I was fired for being over my pto 1 hour, forget the time and energy I’ve put into this company with 100% rating from customers. There is no room here for a black female who happens to be homosexual within this industry. Fortunately, I was able to be a groundbreaking employee whose mom just passed away and brought new clients to this god forsaken company. Thank you for allowing me to catapult into a better situation."

Also, there is no accountability with the drivers, so the job is babysitting and preaching policies because it's rare that management actually enforces them. However, objectively no company is perfect because people aren't perfect. Long-Time Employees in Management - Most of the upper management is stagnant and a good majority of the logistics staff is over the age of 55, so I don't personally see a lot of innovation or growth. They talk a big talk about wanting to grow and change and be inclusive, but their actions say otherwise. Office Culture - You genuinely have to watch what you say around people (especially in the bigger hubs). It's gossip-heavy and there's always a brown-noser willing to run to the supervisors with any negative tidbit they can. There are a few acceptions to the rule, but I'd make sure you know your coworker pretty well before talking about anything. Communication - Each department (Logistics, Sales/Commercial, Patient Services, etc) acts like it's the most taboo thing to communicate beyond the bounds of their ""own people"". The same can be said about the different Logistics hubs as well. There's a lot of division and very limited camaraderie - but it's what they can get away with, so it won't change until management does. Poor Raises - Don't expect more than a $0.50/hr raise each year. They do percentage-based raises, and I've never seen anyone get more than 4% - and that's with a ranking of ""Exceeds Expectations"". Annual Bonus - It's taxed to hell and back. I only kept 60% of what they gave me. So if you're expecting a $1000 bonus, it's really only going to be about $600 when the government is done. I wish they'd just give a better raise instead. The company has made so many changes and not for the better. They recently implemented appointments only at all of their PSCs and they rolled this out without notice to the employees of when it was going to change that way we could've at least notified the patients and the doctors that send their patients to us. This as you can guess has caused patients to get confused and upset since for many many years quest took both appointments and walk ins. The company was pretty okay back then but as of late it just seems like they only care about the bottom line Terrible culture of patriarchy and tenure that extends into HR. the only folks that thrive are the 15-20+ yr tenured folks as they would be too expensive to let go. leadership is steeped in yesterdays passive work and resist change and innovation; Quest is exhibit A where plenty of incompetent men are in leadership roles, get hired with zero experience and and continue to get promoted with a thriving boys club. Top down culture hence there is group think in all areas. Not an innovative , future driven organization that will transform in any way with changing times. Terrible IT infrastructure and not set up for any kind of transformation let alone digital / cloud/ AI continue with the same test volume mentality and refuse to innovate and offer new solutions to customers core health systems business churn You are over worked, and under paid. the company does not care about their employees mental health. People/patients will disrespect you then write a review lying about the phlebotomist. The management is horrible and doesn't work with their employees. They would rather lose good workers than accommodate. You can not stick up for yourself when a patient is being rude to you, if you do they write a review how the phlebotomist was rude but NEVER say what they did. Then your supervisor will write you up for that complaint. The job is awful and phlebotomist get treated like garbage. According to Quest, the patients are always right.

You can not stick up for yourself when a patient is being rude to you, if you do they write a review how the phlebotomist was rude but NEVER say what they did. Then your supervisor will write you up for that complaint. The job is awful and phlebotomist get treated like garbage. According to Quest, the patients are always right.

Challenging Situations: Dealing with stressed or frustrated customers can be emotionally taxing. 2. Workload Pressures: During peak times, the workload can be demanding, requiring multitasking and time management. 3.

Also, there is no accountability with the drivers, so the job is babysitting and preaching policies because it's rare that management actually enforces them. However, objectively no company is perfect because people aren't perfect. Long-Time Employees in Management - Most of the upper management is stagnant and a good majority of the logistics staff is over the age of 55, so I don't personally see a lot of innovation or growth. They talk a big talk about wanting to grow and change and be inclusive, but their actions say otherwise. Office Culture - You genuinely have to watch what you say around people (especially in the bigger hubs). It's gossip-heavy and there's always a brown-noser willing to run to the supervisors with any negative tidbit they can. There are a few acceptions to the rule, but I'd make sure you know your coworker pretty well before talking about anything. Communication - Each department (Logistics, Sales/Commercial, Patient Services, etc) acts like it's the most taboo thing to communicate beyond the bounds of their ""own people"". The same can be said about the different Logistics hubs as well. There's a lot of division and very limited camaraderie - but it's what they can get away with, so it won't change until management does. Poor Raises - Don't expect more than a $0.50/hr raise each year. They do percentage-based raises, and I've never seen anyone get more than 4% - and that's with a ranking of ""Exceeds Expectations"". Annual Bonus - It's taxed to hell and back. I only kept 60% of what they gave me. So if you're expecting a $1000 bonus, it's really only going to be about $600 when the government is done. I wish they'd just give a better raise instead. The company has made so many changes and not for the better. They recently implemented appointments only at all of their PSCs and they rolled this out without notice to the employees of when it was going to change that way we could've at least notified the patients and the doctors that send their patients to us. This as you can guess has caused patients to get confused and upset since for many many years quest took both appointments and walk ins. The company was pretty okay back then but as of late it just seems like they only care about the bottom line Terrible culture of patriarchy and tenure that extends into HR. the only folks that thrive are the 15-20+ yr tenured folks as they would be too expensive to let go. leadership is steeped in yesterdays passive work and resist change and innovation; Quest is exhibit A where plenty of incompetent men are in leadership roles, get hired with zero experience and and continue to get promoted with a thriving boys club. Top down culture hence there is group think in all areas. Not an innovative , future driven organization that will transform in any way with changing times.

Lots of foreign workers. Makes it extremely difficult to communicate and regroup. Transformation is still ongoing for them, and i assume it’s going to continue rapidly with a scorched earth path. Everything is Agile. Literally everything. A scrum ceremony in your sleep. Tech stack is not going to help your career. Work life balance, leadership pressure"

One thing I will say is that no hospital in NYC tops Memorial Sloan Kettering, so when people leave they eventually come back because of the family dynamic we have here. No downsides to working at MSK Hard to move up/grow for certain roles. Long working hours but it depends on what you do and not strict Pay increases aren't performance-based unless your manager really goes to bat for you. You'll likely get a standard cost of living raise every year. I also never received any type of bonus for ""exceeding expectations"". While there is a good process in place for employees to apply to internal positions, salary for these internal transfers are not handled appropriately. Rather than getting paid the appropriate value of the new role, HR tends to base your new compensation as a percentage increase (usually no more than 10%) of your current role. I should have known when I began the onboarding process that this employer was a disaster. Zero communication from onboarding staff and HR and a confusing process that took forever and almost delayed my start date were not good signs. The turnover was another huge red flag. 10 out of 30 care coordinators quit in the same month my first year. The same thing happened my second year. Nothing was done by management to help lessen the burden that was thrust on staff in order to make up for the loss of a third of our coordinators. No preparations were made to hire replacements in a timely fashion. No preparation was made for training these replacements. Brand new employees were thrust into positions that required a year of training. Care Coordinators were told they didn't have a choice about running a clinical practice. Running a clinical practice is a job that requires a raise and promotion, but new hires were told that's now how things were done and received no compensation for extra work. When you became good at your job, you were asked to do another person's job. Often we were asked to do two or 3 people's jobs at once without any extra pay or compensation. Doctors and nurse practitioners treated us as personal assistants, often asking us to do work that was clinical in nature, knowing well that they made 4 to 5 times the money we did. They could be rude and condescending. I received emails with one line from a doctor ""why didn't you do this"" when the task in question was actually not legally allowable for me to do. If that wasn't enough, our managers gaslit and lied to us. Whenever a meeting was called, not a single positive thing was mentioned about the work we did, but plenty was to be said about where to improve. When we worked 10 hours of overtime in a week (sometimes working 10-12 hour shifts with no lunch break), we received condescending emails from our managers if we were 7 minutes late the next day. Very little support was offered to leave at our scheduled time. I often missed appointments that I had scheduled because I wasn't able to leave. No support was offered for anyone to take lunch, and it was company culture that no one did. When meetings were opened up for questions or comments about policies or practice changes, our concerns were immediately discounted and invalidated by our managers. ""That's just how it is going to be"" was the attitude with zero thought about how it might impact us. To feel constantly unsupported and exhausted while the children that are the patients are dying was too much. In January (while the nurses were striking at other hospitals for lower patient/nurse ration) MSK decided to lay off a thousand employees (including nurses), thus raising the patient:nurse ratio at MSK to unsafe levels. They claimed they had lost money during the pandemic and ceased many programs (COVID vaccination, tuition remission, raises) that year. As a Care Coordinator, my job became about billing and how many patients we could take on, which became unmanageable. We physically did not have the space and providers for all of the patients that the hospital kept forcing us to take on which delayed critical treatment for kids. Working so hard for so little money, continuously being taken advantage of for doing a good job, and being surrounded by people who are rude and condescending was too much for me. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I hope that MSK will change their culture to make staff stay. It's no surprise to me why there's so much turnover, but the management certainly seems shocked every time. I hope they will learn to open their eyes and ears. Horrible management. Most of the management team do not work and do not help. Do not give you life outside of work, schedule comes out 2 days before the new week and you get only one weekend off per month. Overworked, underpaid, feels lonely at the top Difficulty advancing as a Nurse, near impossible demands to do so. The system that’s used sets one up for failure, and it’s unfair and biased. Upper management makes unit based decisions without Nurse input, placing Nurses and patients at risk. MSK is a business, and like any business money is the key factor. Forcing Nurses to work in an environment without proper training or support (ex: adult to peds) and completely ignoring the Nurses concerns. Nurse Educators are never around, or don’t know what they’re teaching. Management is not supportive, or non existent, and belittles the staff for having concerns that can affect one’s license, as well as constant micromanagement when they do come around. Understaffed, overbooked, and constantly rushed to get patients in chairs and treated. Office coordinators and their manager make the rules, not Nursing. Was once a great place to work, but constant changes to policies, rules, etc.; and lack of Nurse support has created a toxic environment and extremely low morale causing Nurses to leave. Staff Nurses are made to be charge, or responsible for scheduling and if you’re not part of their clique you are penalized with heavier workloads, and a horrible schedule. Preferential treatment is given to certain Nurses, while others are left to pick up the slack.

While there is a good process in place for employees to apply to internal positions, salary for these internal transfers are not handled appropriately. Rather than getting paid the appropriate value of the new role, HR tends to base your new compensation as a percentage increase (usually no more than 10%) of your current role. I should have known when I began the onboarding process that this employer was a disaster. Zero communication from onboarding staff and HR and a confusing process that took forever and almost delayed my start date were not good signs. The turnover was another huge red flag. 10 out of 30 care coordinators quit in the same month my first year. The same thing happened my second year. Nothing was done by management to help lessen the burden that was thrust on staff in order to make up for the loss of a third of our coordinators. No preparations were made to hire replacements in a timely fashion. No preparation was made for training these replacements. Brand new employees were thrust into positions that required a year of training. Care Coordinators were told they didn't have a choice about running a clinical practice. Running a clinical practice is a job that requires a raise and promotion, but new hires were told that's now how things were done and received no compensation for extra work. When you became good at your job, you were asked to do another person's job. Often we were asked to do two or 3 people's jobs at once without any extra pay or compensation. Doctors and nurse practitioners treated us as personal assistants, often asking us to do work that was clinical in nature, knowing well that they made 4 to 5 times the money we did. They could be rude and condescending. I received emails with one line from a doctor ""why didn't you do this"" when the task in question was actually not legally allowable for me to do. If that wasn't enough, our managers gaslit and lied to us. Whenever a meeting was called, not a single positive thing was mentioned about the work we did, but plenty was to be said about where to improve. When we worked 10 hours of overtime in a week (sometimes working 10-12 hour shifts with no lunch break), we received condescending emails from our managers if we were 7 minutes late the next day. Very little support was offered to leave at our scheduled time. I often missed appointments that I had scheduled because I wasn't able to leave. No support was offered for anyone to take lunch, and it was company culture that no one did. When meetings were opened up for questions or comments about policies or practice changes, our concerns were immediately discounted and invalidated by our managers. ""That's just how it is going to be"" was the attitude with zero thought about how it might impact us. To feel constantly unsupported and exhausted while the children that are the patients are dying was too much. In January (while the nurses were striking at other hospitals for lower patient/nurse ration) MSK decided to lay off a thousand employees (including nurses), thus raising the patient:nurse ratio at MSK to unsafe levels. They claimed they had lost money during the pandemic and ceased many programs (COVID vaccination, tuition remission, raises) that year. As a Care Coordinator, my job became about billing and how many patients we could take on, which became unmanageable. We physically did not have the space and providers for all of the patients that the hospital kept forcing us to take on which delayed critical treatment for kids. Working so hard for so little money, continuously being taken advantage of for doing a good job, and being surrounded by people who are rude and condescending was too much for me. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I hope that MSK will change their culture to make staff stay. It's no surprise to me why there's so much turnover, but the management certainly seems shocked every time. I hope they will learn to open their eyes and ears. Horrible management. Most of the management team do not work and do not help. Do not give you life outside of work, schedule comes out 2 days before the new week and you get only one weekend off per month. No downsides to working at MSK Overworked, underpaid, feels lonely at the top Difficulty advancing as a Nurse, near impossible demands to do so. The system that’s used sets one up for failure, and it’s unfair and biased. Upper management makes unit based decisions without Nurse input, placing Nurses and patients at risk. MSK is a business, and like any business money is the key factor. Forcing Nurses to work in an environment without proper training or support (ex: adult to peds) and completely ignoring the Nurses concerns. Nurse Educators are never around, or don’t know what they’re teaching. Management is not supportive, or non existent, and belittles the staff for having concerns that can affect one’s license, as well as constant micromanagement when they do come around. Understaffed, overbooked, and constantly rushed to get patients in chairs and treated. Office coordinators and their manager make the rules, not Nursing. Was once a great place to work, but constant changes to policies, rules, etc.; and lack of Nurse support has created a toxic environment and extremely low morale causing Nurses to leave. Staff Nurses are made to be charge, or responsible for scheduling and if you’re not part of their clique you are penalized with heavier workloads, and a horrible schedule.

Get your experience and then leave.Working alongside talented people Flexibility with schedule I enjoy what I do I am continuously learning new things The pay Amazon, and especially AWS, is a training ground for smart, execution-oriented, hard-working tech professionals. The company emphasizes delivering constant results, thinking big, and a hierarchical culture, so it may not be for everyone. But for those who are driven, you will grow immensely. One especially salient and unique pro of working at Amazon is the ability to grow your career into different directions that you could never imagine. At most tech companies, you're hired to do your job well. At Amazon, succeeding in one role or team means most other teams will take a chance on you. This is particularly valuable in the early and mid-stages of your career. I know this depends on the team so this might not apply to every part of AWS so take this with a grain of salt, I will just talk about my division. I have received lots of help from current coworkers as well as previous ones (the ones I met during my internship). While managers are very busy, so far they have never denied a time to meet me and guide me. In my division and team people work hard but only their hours which is something that I really love because I don’t bring work to home. I definitely feel welcomed here and I am very thankful because they gave me my first job opportunity. At AWS, you will end up working so much that there won't be any dearth to learning. Depends how much you want to make your work part of your life. -Endless opportunities for growth given the scale of the company -No one tells you that you can't work on a project -There is always hiring to do (which is great as a recruiter) -You're able to be a true partner to Hiring Manager's and the business as long as you stand up for yourself and have manager support -There is an endless amount of problems to solve. Most things are figured out, but there is a lot of room for improvement in pockets and some groups lag behind others Ability to own a huge scope. Room to innovate if you take and/or demand it. Lots of opportunities to hone your business writing skills. It's good for getting your foot in the door/if you are starting in tech. Benefits aren't too bad either. Get your experience and then leave. Innovative Environment: Working as a scientist at AWS has been a dream come true. The company offers a highly innovative and intellectually stimulating environment that constantly challenges me to push the boundaries of my expertise. Top-Tier Resources: AWS provides unparalleled resources for scientific research, including access to high-performance computing, expansive datasets, and advanced machine learning tools. Impactful Work: The projects I've been involved in have real-world impact, ranging from healthcare to environmental conservation. It's immensely satisfying to know that my work contributes to positive changes globally. Weekly Check and taking off early if you want only within your granted hours limit. That's it.","Company is difficult to navigate due to size. Teams are silo’s which sometimes leads to duplication of work. Can be bureaucratic at times I don’t see this being mentioned in public too often and I think it should draw the attention of some people. At Amazon engineering does own their products completely, which also means you have to be oncall one week every 2-3 months (that means 24/7 pending for any problems arising from them) depending on your team size. I personally don’t have a problem with this, but a lot do so I put it here, but now you are required to come 3 times a week to the office. 1. Writing, writing and writing - Employees just write all the time and then the papers go to dust! 2. Weird calls!! If its a 30 minute call, people spend 20 minutes in reading through the document and 5 min for discussion and 5 minutes for next steps. is 5 min of discussion enough? Moreover, there is culture of providing weird and stupid feedback on documents. Amazon expects everyone to be a writer! If I were to become one then why would I write documents, i will write books and be happy! 3. Too many Indians in tech staff and they are always trying to please American bosses through Weekly, Monthly and Quarterly Business Reviews. 4. No work life balance, you will end up doing 2 people jobs or even more. 5. Those who say that AWS pays well, don't know what industry standards are. Salary is definitely low. 6. Employees have a habit of using Leadership Principles (LPs) in every day conversation and they don't mean it! They just use them to make others feel how much they value the LPs 7. AWS Leaders always want to go to events and make great announcements and don't care about the staff who has to work 70+ hours a week to make things happen 8. Managers save all travel opportunities for themselves and their directs never get opportunity to attend any of the shiny events. and I have more but you get the point i guess! -Everything I wrote for the pros might be a thing of the past. I was impacted by lay-offs and all of my friends that remain with the company have no work to do and are in a very toxic environment at the moment -Your manager sort of makes or breaks your experience -You won't always get the help you ask for since everyone is so busy - Sycophantic employees mean innovation can only come if politics are in your favor - Work hours are 60+ every week; no time for skills development - Only able to prioritize health if you land a good manager. The other 75% will have you working till 2am and not think twice. - Majority male indians for coworkers who were born, raised and educated in India, resulting in dominant cultural norms being dictated by Indian culture, which for Indian leaders in the US is often arrogant, dismissive, immature, tone deaf and generally lacking in self awareness. Bringing the Amazon workplace vibe to a 1980s US workplace vibe. - Amazon's preference for hiring foreign Indian talent means that US standards are thrown out the window and foreigners workers are held hostage by the Amazon sponsored work visa; ergo you can exploit this talent more than a US born employee. This is a big problem the government needs to crack down on. Working in AWS datacenters can be extremely stressful and not fulfilling. Management is where a lot of the problems stem from in this company. This is a TECH job first and foremost however management doesn't understand that. In certain clusters almost NONE of your managers are former techs which shows you how they are about promoting people from within. They are trying to run datacenters almost like fulfillment centers. They don't understand that the two are completely different. A lot of good techs have left to go to competitors and yet the management sticks around. It's almost like a revolving door for good workers. Come in work hard for your team get denied promotions/raises leave and go somewhere else. There is also a good amount of micro-managing that happens so be prepared for that. Fast-Paced Environment: The fast-paced nature of AWS can sometimes lead to a demanding workload, which might not be suitable for individuals who prefer a more relaxed pace. Learning Curve: Given the cutting-edge nature of the work, there can be a steep learning curve for newcomers. Adapting to the latest tools and techniques may require extra effort initially.

I still made 3 to 4 times the money being self employed so no hard feelings. It's a myth that you can say no if you get a message on the workstation computer monitor to report to a different department. Dreading a department is no excuse! Go or otherwise get wrote up. You are called to a different department every day or night. Traning is really not training at Amazon. After two days you are on your own and accountable. You get wrote up on your first day of being on your own if you don't make the rate. I have to build up speed is no excuse at Amazon. There is no such thing as the speed will come later when you learn the job. You must have the speed now!

It's almost like a revolving door for good workers. Come in work hard for your team get denied promotions/raises leave and go somewhere else. There is also a good amount of micro-managing that happens so be prepared for that. Fast-Paced Environment: The fast-paced nature of AWS can sometimes lead to a demanding workload, which might not be suitable for individuals who prefer a more relaxed pace. Learning Curve: Given the cutting-edge nature of the work, there can be a steep learning curve for newcomers. Adapting to the latest tools and techniques may require extra effort initially. You are not listened to as an employee. They put you in a work share system. I did well as a stower and always consistently found myself in the top 10 out of about 180 stowers. The computer game monitor was a competition. So what, I did very well as a stower. The areas I struggled in to make rate was Out-Bound Packing and Inbound Decant. You get a message to report to a department that really isn't your department. I was wrote up 6 times and eventually fired. I was wrote up 5 times in Decant and 1 time in Packing.I knew nothing of my 3rd and 4th write ups until I gotten my 5th write up. I was going to be quitting around the month I was let go. I still made 3 to 4 times the money being self employed so no hard feelings. It's a myth that you can say no if you get a message on the workstation computer monitor to report to a different department. Dreading a department is no excuse! Go or otherwise get wrote up. You are called to a different department every day or night. Traning is really not training at Amazon. After two days you are on your own and accountable. You get wrote up on your first day of being on your own if you don't make the rate. I have to build up speed is no excuse at Amazon. There is no such thing as the speed will come later when you learn the job. You must have the speed now! I have heard a lot of complaints about Amazon as a whole especially now with the RTO mandate I truly feel bad for a lot of them and wish them the best. A con would be miscommunication from the top down, lots of management is blindsided by decisions being made from above them.Company is difficult to navigate due to size. Teams are silo’s which sometimes leads to duplication of work. Deadlines are critical Sometimes hectic Not much benefits All week work from office No free food I don’t see this being mentioned in public too often and I think it should draw the attention of some people. At Amazon engineering does own their products completely, which also means you have to be oncall one week every 2-3 months (that means 24/7 pending for any problems arising from them) depending on your team size. I personally don’t have a problem with this, but a lot do so I put it here, but now you are required to come 3 times a week to the office. -Everything I wrote for the pros might be a thing of the past.

Learning Curve: Given the cutting-edge nature of the work, there can be a steep learning curve for newcomers. Adapting to the latest tools and techniques may require extra effort initially. * Bureaucracy * Support Engineering lately has been trending more towards call center style * Managers want to help but too many hurdles I have heard a lot of complaints about Amazon as a whole especially now with the RTO mandate I truly feel bad for a lot of them and wish them the best. A con would be miscommunication from the top down, lots of management is blindsided by decisions being made from above them. 1. Writing, writing and writing - Employees just write all the time and then the papers go to dust! 2. Weird calls!! If its a 30 minute call, people spend 20 minutes in reading through the document and 5 min for discussion and 5 minutes for next steps. is 5 min of discussion enough? Moreover, there is culture of providing weird and stupid feedback on documents. Amazon expects everyone to be a writer! If I were to become one then why would I write documents, i will write books and be happy! 3. Too many Indians in tech staff and they are always trying to please American bosses through Weekly, Monthly and Quarterly Business Reviews. 4. No work life balance, you will end up doing 2 people jobs or even more. 5. Those who say that AWS pays well, don't know what industry standards are. Salary is definitely low. 6. Employees have a habit of using Leadership Principles (LPs) in every day conversation and they don't mean it! They just use them to make others feel how much they value the LPs 7. AWS Leaders always want to go to events and make great announcements and don't care about the staff who has to work 70+ hours a week to make things happen 8. Managers save all travel opportunities for themselves and their directs never get opportunity to attend any of the shiny events. and I have more but you get the point i guess! - Sycophantic employees mean innovation can only come if politics are in your favor - Work hours are 60+ every week; no time for skills development - Only able to prioritize health if you land a good manager. The other 75% will have you working till 2am and not think twice. - Majority male indians for coworkers who were born, raised and educated in India, resulting in dominant cultural norms being dictated by Indian culture, which for Indian leaders in the US is often arrogant, dismissive, immature, tone deaf and generally lacking in self awareness. Bringing the Amazon workplace vibe to a 1980s US workplace vibe. - Amazon's preference for hiring foreign Indian talent means that US standards are thrown out the window and foreigners workers are held hostage by the Amazon sponsored work visa; ergo you can exploit this talent more than a US born employee. This is a big problem the government needs to crack down on. Working in AWS datacenters can be extremely stressful and not fulfilling.

Huge turnover at the Charlotte facility. - mediocre management as far as development and overall - strong lack of organization and structure - mediocre pay for the educated candidates - unfair bias and upfront disregard amongst employees of races - an overload of work responsibilities - unfair travel and work conditions - team members and management project a very unhealthy and traditional work-life balance as they accept and live it - very overwhelming at times and may feel unsupported by team and management They run off of Ford schedule. When they shut down we shut down. The point system favors the people in the office. If we want to get paid for holidays we have to use it out of OUR PTO which we earn every week as vacation time but you can't save up anything because you need to pay yourself on a non working holiday. No bonuses. Haven't even got a raise this year in which we used to every year for at least cist of living. - On Feet for several hours - Can't use your phone - Uniforms mandatory Get new management for this warehouse. Period. Hire supervisors that actually know the different job functions, that can actually drive a forklift, that knows how to work the technology that everyone uses. A supervisor that doesn't say ""I don't know"" to EVERY question an employee asks Never got to start the job that I was employed for. I, along with about 20 others, never got a chance to start working because of an issue they experienced with their contract with ABB. Being a third party logistics provider, there are no guarantees to associates due to constantly evolving contracts btw site owners and the companies they provide logistics for. Therefore the salaries they offer and yearly raises aren't as much as companies that provide their own logistics. They have recently done away with paid holidays and their new PTO policies leave associates with less paid time off to accrue. Associates with 30 or more years with the company had their vacations they earned reduced drastically as well as amount of PTO they can accrue. It can be a tough deal to do all of their trainings Long hours No OT No life outside of work"
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Banana-Republic-Reviews-E23057.htm,"As a brand Gap is pretty great to their employees and so Banana is the same. Friends and family Generous discount Upper management does what they can to make you feel supported Employee discount,Benefits are good, team is amazing Everyone below a VP level is fantastic and creative. Beautiful offices, good time off and good benefits. -maybe flexible scheduling based on your manager(s) -15 min break for 4 hour shift, 30 min for 6 hour, 1 hour for 8 hours and above - snacks sometimes provided - was previously an all-black dress code but has changed to a neutral color dress code - boutique-style visual environment can make you feel nice - Always something to do - Brand is expanding so new roles are being created within brick and mortar stores - Development and training is very detailed and available (when you have ingested leaders) - Flexible scheduling - Generous discount across all gap inc brands Management was professional and well-organized in communication and store management. It made things easier to handle. Loved the discount for the employees. The culture in Banana Republic is wonderful , however the concept is in jeopardy for brick and mortar stores especially in small markets. I have now closed 2 stores and while being profitable; making KPI's, credit and customer service scores and balancing all elements of leading a team. As much as I enjoyed working there the stress of another store closing makes me leery of leading another team as I do not have control or input over property management decisions regarding rent. Double digit increases in comp and gross margin do not compete with absurd rent increases and corporate companies rightfully have to make decisions based upon financials. My brain understands but my heart hurts for my employees and community. Ask questions and if in a smaller market proceed with caution. This is a great entry-level job if you hope to one day manage a store. Good upwards movement in the company. discount is 60% get to do lots of stuff","Performance reviews don't happen fast or often enough in terms of performance raises. The training structure could be better it is retail ,so work-life balance is not giving It is nearly impossible to feel successful or empowered in a role there. The president of the company wastes money like it’s nothing and changes her mind with the wind. She makes no effort to know any of her employees, even those at a senior or director level. VPs drink the koolaid and I know several people have left due to bullying and harsh treatment. Gap considers itself a responsible company but one VP has been reported to HR so many times and HR claims they are doing something but they do nothing. It’s all lip service. Good work is not rewarded, it is often only criticized and never praised. It’s a Mean Girls mentality there and there is absolutely zero strategy beyond the whim of the president who knows absolutely nothing about clothing or style. No one is trusted to actually do their job. Everyone is micromanaged within an inch of their life and she is disliked by everyone in every department. No one respects her in a true sense of the word. She rules (as do her VPs) with fear and I would venture to say there are very few, if any, happy corporate employees there. Many many 5am and 10pm phone calls and texts. No boundaries whatsoever. -too much work (atelier client sign ups, credit card sales, loyalty reward sign ups, regular sales, high customer service quality) with no commission - have to keep track of own sales, sign ups, and atelier sign ups daily on a sheet - will put your name out on a platform for everyone to see if you do not sell a card for the month -required all-store meetings where headquarters or district managers will attend even for part-timers -company has been changing store to a boutique style in a visuals and marketing but does not pay workers enough for required above and beyond service to customers -store rules, marketing tactics, and product information are constantly changing because headquarters keep on trying new directions for the rebranding of banana - very picky about dress code and needs to be dressed in layers with accessories without burdened expenses or free pieces from the company - some stores also have furniture or special art pieces that require extra product information for you to memorize on top of everything else above - sometimes drama or gossip within - Work life balance (it’s not always consistent) - have to work on holidays - if you’re not agile, you will fail. Some of the customers were a challenge but we got through it as a team. Changing schedules was something to deal with. Gets really busy on the weekend. Store closures as Banana Republic tries to find relevancy in today's market. Career opportunities decreasing due to shrinking market. Working in a mall all day. can be boring when no customers depends on staff your enjoyment"

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Northwell-Health-Reviews-E1142964.htm,"Management does go out of their way to help you with any issues you run into and they support you when facing challenges. They also are very supportive of career advancement! Good support present for staff A very oiled machine, led by a visionary leader Co workers, environment, salary, locations, Good benefits Access to multiple sources and different providers They pay higher than market rate for administrative assistants, but the standards are high and the work can be stressful. If you can manage your time effectively and stay organized it'll be easier for you. . Northwell does go out of their way to show appreciation for its employees and it does go along way. Working for this company was stressful, but I always felt valued. Most admin jobs in healthcare right now pay $18 per hour, Northwell pays $22 per hour. Patients come first, this makes my job easier when patients feel like they matter. Pay was good, union benefits, plenty of opportunity for advancement... amazing coworkers that made the toughest days manageable Leadership is great and they empower their employees and provide opportunities to grow within the organization Friendly staff and flexible, nice work environment Can’t speak for all management teams but there are great leadership members - recent pay increase but would be great if it was more due to inflation rates and cost of living","A lot of the equipment is a little outdated. Staffing issues and ratios too high for acuity Non-whites are usually not promoted as quickly as their counterparts. patient to staff ratios are high Salaries could be more competitive Their structure changed after the pandemic, front desk, surgical coordinators, and billers became administrative assistants and everyone is cross trained to do multiple jobs in the event someone is out sick for an extended period of time. If you are applying for roles within Northwell your manager will find out, can stop you from leaving. Sometimes it's easier to just move onto another company. Also, if you start with their temp agency, get hired, and move on to another job not within the company you cannot get back in through the temp agency Managers with morals and high employee satisfaction rates get fired. Pay is relatively low and not enough PTO No gaurentted hours every week Short staffed Some management won’t let more than 1 nurse off for PTO"

They say hybrid work, but the CEO is pushing for full time onsite workers and is serious about it. Make sure you push for a comfortable salary during your offer phase before coming onboard. EA's often do not get more than the 3% every other year or for a salary raise if that. Upper management gets hefty bonuses. Upper management EA's DO NOT. But you do get that OT for the 60-hour weeks. So, there is that. I spent almost 16 years here so, it wasn’t all bad. Hard work but the rewards were ok. Then they started to change things around my 10th year. Less income for the field, and more for upper management. Then they took away the incentives that drove going the extra mile for the customer. I think when Doug Baker left, so did the soul of Ecolab. Most of the guys at the top didn’t come in at the bottom. You constantly are feeling the crunch of the administrative side of things by having to document each step of your sales processes so upper management can track your work. The amount of work spent selling isn't translated into that high of commision dollars, ""the selling"" IS your job and you need to do it in order to keep your job. They’ll attempt to sweep your personal life under the rug and ask when you can work next. They’re understaffed with a high turnover rate. They’re squeezing fresh employees with hopes of ignorance. Quick to get you in the door and even faster to over load you with someone else’s work or work that has been pass due in hopes of bumping their annual bonuses by small margins. Mismanagement, low moral during any meetings, poor instruction, belittlement of employees. You’ll likely never have a weekend off as they allow call backs(must be responded to in 24hrs, yes on your day off and are extremely likely) to jobs for moronic reasonings(most occurred example: pest witnessed outside) that are not outlined in proper call back procedures for fear of losing the customer. They charge customers monthly without proper monthly inspections and do not drop clients even while understaffed(I witnessed these while conducting routine services on equipment that had gone uninspected for well over a year). Pay trends low compared to industry averages at analyst and manager levels. Management can be slow to promote. No bonus pay for analysts. Stiff corporate culture where it is sometimes difficult to push back against management and freely express yourself. A ""yes man"" culture exists. The vacation roll over policy has been removed so you use up all your time. This causes issues in people losing out on their earns vacation time or all has to be used at the end of the year causing short staffing issues and coverage troubles. They expect reps to perform a huge number of related tasks that are not in the job description, and often get in the way of completing real, profitable work. Corporate red-tape is a nightmare. They have the habit of making people managers that aren't fit to be managers Getting too much corporate bull crap. Adding meaningless work and things to do for no reason. All a numbers game and just a what have you done for me lately company. You can do great one month but the next month it’s “ yeah that was last month what have you don’t this month”. You’re just a number not a person. And hours can be crazy with being on call all the timeCorporate Ladders Stink Too many cooks in the kitchen to get a simple task done Commission is capped at $250K This company only cares about their upper management's bonuses.

Get to learn different things and habits of helping people Decent pay Good people Good atmosphere Great work environment, growth and development","worked lots of nights during school Limited hours of operation: Chick-fil-A is known for being closed on Sundays, which is a part of their company-wide policy. While this closure aligns with their values and allows employees a day off, it may also limit the number of working hours available compared to establishments that operate seven days a week. This can be a disadvantage for individuals seeking full-time employment or those who rely on consistent work hours. Fast-paced and demanding environment: Chick-fil-A is popular and often experiences high customer volumes, especially during peak times. This can create a fast-paced and demanding work environment that requires employees to work efficiently under pressure. It may not be suitable for individuals who prefer a slower-paced or more relaxed work atmosphere. During rushes, it can be very stressful. My location didn't have any cover for when we were outside order taking so I got really sunburned during the summer. Summer and Winters are the worst for order taking. Managers can sometimes get on a power trip and be really harsh, which has made some team members cry, but I've never personally gone through that. But we changed Operators a couple of years ago, new Operator brought his old team with him, and don’t feel as valued with I did with old Operator. Pay is not consistent-some team members are paid less than they should be based on their time with the restaurant and their position and how hard they work and meanwhile, new team members are being paid higher and doing less. There is a lot of favoritism towards the team from Operator’s old restaurant as well as certain other employees. Part-time people have an hard time getting hours because all hours are given to full-timers. And they keep hiring more people so people are always begging for hours. Also, since COVID, I feel we stopped a lot of the little things that made Chick-fil-A stand out from the other fast food restaurants in our area. they work you like crazy if you don't set boundaries from the beginning and they do not care that you are 16. depending on team leads and managers it can be hell to work there. depending on the store if you are black, you may be uncomfortable, TONS of microaggressions With family comes drama at times. However, things usually work themselves out. The fast paced environment can tend to be a bit much for some. Not necessarily a con, but if you do not work well in fast paced environments ^ would recommend working a shift without a dinner or lunch rush From discrimination to nepotism, favoritism, and double standards, the directors at this particular store are completely incompetent. I have never worked for anyone who is so horrible at being a business owner that they will literally tell an employee to their face that he doesn't care about their well-being or care if they are short-staffed. Apparently, it's not what you know about business, but who you know that gets you a Chick Fil A restaurant of your own. Pay is not commensurate to the workload, and if you kiss their you know what you might get a pay increase or promotion but it is not retro active to when you get it, it's whenever the incompetent HR (sister of owner) gets around to doing it. Management sucked and was very picky at the one I worked at Very fast-paced, not good communication.worked lots of nights during school Limited hours of operation: Chick-fil-A is known for being closed on Sundays, which is a part of their company-wide policy.

None! It was a great experience. NA NA NA NA NA Sometimes my coworkers were annoying, I guess? I don't think there are many opportunities for further professional development and promotion. Atrocious pay, no room for growth low pay, revolving door, no incentive to stay Nature of Work: Although the lab is positioned as an applied research entity, there is an increasing focus on 6.3 and 6.4 work, which doesn't align with the core mission of applied research. The shift towards test and evaluation tasks might be a concern for those primarily interested in research. Faculty Treatment: The treatment of faculty can be inconsistent. There's a lack of support in terms of startup funds and mentorship, which can make the career progression of new assistant professors challenging. This has led to a decline in the number of faculty members over the last decade. Office Space: Office accommodations vary widely, often leaving senior staff in less desirable spaces. Despite management's claims that the issue is widespread, some new hires receive newly renovated, air-conditioned offices. More equitable distribution of office space would benefit all. Career Progression: Mid-career growth opportunities are limited, often requiring one to take on substantial projects or manage a department to advance. This bottleneck has led to a noticeable gap in the workforce between mid-career and near-retirement professionals. Leadership Vision: While some managers are forward-thinking, others seem to lack a clear vision for their departments' future. A more strategic approach, rather than one solely driven by funding, would benefit the long-term growth and direction of the lab.

If you're a hard worker and pride yourself on that instead of spending most of your time socializing, I suggest you get your experience and then look elsewhere.

They pay for actuarial certifications and give work time for exams. Used to be a pension & parking subsidy (parking costs $90/month in garage in Phx) but no more. Health benefits are good (although all high deductible plans, which work for me). Stock price is high. Take part in the 401(k) and buy stock! It adds up. If you join--try to negotiate as high a salary as you can since pay is not great. Use the tuition benefit and get an advanced degree in 2 years, stay a third so you don't need to pay it back, then leave. Bounce to a few other companies and come back if you want, since that's the only way your salary will increase decently.

Good people and good management","- Somewhat slow to adopt newer office technology like cloud solutions, simultaneous team editing, etc. The LA office is extremely toxic, especially for POCs. There are senior associates and principals who bully and retaliate. However, your manager or leadership will not do anything about it and will retaliate as well. Promotions are based on favoritism. Mercer does not practice what they preach to their clients at all. There is no diversity and they don't care about the health and well-being of their day to day staff.

Base pay increases for mid/late career didn’t keep up with inflation. In the wealth business, they were largely focused on growing assets under management. Being a well-respected high quality consultant used to be the goal many years ago.

Leadership does not want to hear even slightly negative feedback, which is necessary for positive change. Recent restructuring has raised billable hour goals to 1600 for virtually everyone this year (2023), which is a significant increase for many.

Base pay increases for mid/late career didn’t keep up with inflation. In the wealth business, they were largely focused on growing assets under management. Being a well-respected high quality consultant used to be the goal many years ago. Often this would lead to revenue growth as clients trusted their consultant and would take their advice leading to increased services/sales. Employees were also treated like the key company asset that they are, resulting in various little perks. Things changed and the only thing that mattered was high sales/high billable hours. Mgmt didn’t really care about employee well-being or work-life balance, other than giving it lip service so they could ride the ESG bandwagon. We were recently informed we are expected back in the office 3 days a week, unless we had already made our work from home status official (we were not made aware of this). Advancement process is inequitable--make friends with those at the top (or at least the top of your group). Really. Workload is too much for the reward. Pay is low unless you leave for a year. Then come back, make a lot more and get a promotion immediately or the following year. Stay and stagnate. Many left last year. No real repercussions for mediocre performance. No benefits for working night and day to meet/exceed client expectations and fill gaps others leave. Leadership does not want to hear even slightly negative feedback, which is necessary for positive change. Recent restructuring has raised billable hour goals to 1600 for virtually everyone this year (2023), which is a significant increase for many. (Although almost no nonbillable hours are expected outside of trainings, meeting as with supervisors and a few more quarterly meetings.). Employees mostly unwilling to go the extra mile. Leadership mostly unconcerned with opinions of the masses. Managers mostly will not help. Was a much more toxic environment, but working from home helped alleviate a lot of that. Backstabbing/sabotage is a real problem so beware. Most staff are decent; issues seem to be mostly involving managers/leadership staff. Disheartening to be an employee. Lead consultants don't advocate for analysts/associates. Some lead consultants have no hesitation to throw the analysts under the bus in front of colleagues and clients. They really don't care about analysts and associates staying at work day and night as long as they get to go home before 5 PM. Long hours 1-3% annual salary increase; no negotiation toxic culture I feel that the promotion is a bit slow They are now requiring employees to go in to the office 3 days a week Poor mid-level executive leadership/transparency Mediocre benefits The only major con would be the learning curve. At times it can be a little daunting, but this is the nature of the business. Hours could be quite long. OT at the analyst level is nice"

We aren’t being paid. This business uses an intentionally difficult to understand commission structure, that is impossible to audit or challenge in any meaningful way. New reps are sold into the organization with an expectation of unlimited earning potential and a myriad of compensation options, but those payments never arrive. Quotas go up, sometimes totally arbitrarily, and Comp structure changes each fiscal. They don’t bonus you on time, or accurately. Management will send you to HR for asking about where your money is, and HR will send you back to management. These issues were brought to regional management and upper level management over six months ago. We are still not being paid. Salary/Pay ranges tend to be lower than averages for markets and nationally. If you are not comfortable with change management philosophies, it can be difficult to keep up with being agile in your role's responsibilities and driving results. Very ""corporate"" not a small company, lots of rules to follow. Limited resources Technology Silo mentality ""Not my job"" Pay too many moving parts- sometimes no one takes accountability When I was hired, I was sold a dream that became a false reality. I was told that the best part about working at paychex was the exceptional culture and amazing work like balance. Couldn’t be further from the truth. For one, you feel like a chicken running around with its head cut off from all the different areas of focus they want you to implement. My main role was to sell payroll, which is complex being new, then they hammer you to be knowledgeable in other areas with HR and retirement and merchant service that you feel like you can’t ever become a subject expert in the one thing I was hired to sell which was payroll. Second, You are really just a number at this company. There is constant pressure to run faster and harder. They say selling season is the craziest month, but honestly they hammer you every month. You feel bad for taking anytime off because if you do, your meeting and eup numbers are down that week (naturally because you took time off) but then they expect you to come back and make up all your numbers you missed that week for for the month. It’s just all micromanaged down to the nth degree. You write multiple goals and commitment plans that are just iterations of the same thing that are a complete time waster. Third, don’t fall for the unlimited PTO BS. They make you feel bad for taking anytime off. It’s natural to not have as many meetings because you took time off! Don’t make employees feel like they can’t ever take time off when you sell them on unlimited PTO!! Fourth, the commission structure is so complicated that it’s hard to really determine how much you’re going to make on a sale. They change the structure too frequently too. When I was there they changed it to where if you didn’t hit 75% of units then you don’t get paid on any of those units you sold. That’s robbery in my opinion. You mean to tell me that if I bring in revenue for the company, I don’t get credit for it if it’s not a certain amount. Come one. Robbery. The mentorship program is useless. All my mentor did was show me how to submit a deal from the paperwork side. Which is overly complicated btw. Ultimately, I struggled to hit quota. My whole team struggle to hit quota regularly and then being new and having an underperforming territory that had 1.5 banks, because one was a solution branch, and CPA’s that hadn’t seen a paychex rep in 10yrs and took time to build trust, I struggle to hit quota. I still sold each month but not at 100%. Because of this my manager told me once I was off mentorship and there about 9 months if I wasn’t at 100% quota she had to let me go. After multiple conversations she told me it was black and white. I reached all my activity metrics for EUP’s and meetings, but not quite at 100%. She even wrote me up for it and put me on an improvement plan with threatening termination! How does threatening to fire someone help them improve! The worst part about it was my manager was newer in her role and had never been a rep in my position before nor had any sales experience!! So how could I feel like I’m taking advice from someone that’s been in my shoes to improve!! Talk about the blind leading the blind! Ultimately I felt backed into a corner and felt like I was going to be fired because my pipline wasn’t there and I was going to be fired so I left. This company is a complete hypocrite to what they teach you about business. How a business employees are their greatest asset and it’s cheaper to retain an employee than hire a new one. Yeah right. I was told that I was just a number and if I wasn’t at quota then I had to be let go. Dispite giving my best and trying. I mean I wasn’t even there a whole year yet!!!

When I was there they changed it to where if you didn’t hit 75% of units then you don’t get paid on any of those units you sold. That’s robbery in my opinion. You mean to tell me that if I bring in revenue for the company, I don’t get credit for it if it’s not a certain amount. Come one. Robbery. The mentorship program is useless. All my mentor did was show me how to submit a deal from the paperwork side. Which is overly complicated btw. Ultimately, I struggled to hit quota. My whole team struggle to hit quota regularly and then being new and having an underperforming territory that had 1.5 banks, because one was a solution branch, and CPA’s that hadn’t seen a paychex rep in 10yrs and took time to build trust, I struggle to hit quota. I still sold each month but not at 100%. Because of this my manager told me once I was off mentorship and there about 9 months if I wasn’t at 100% quota she had to let me go. After multiple conversations she told me it was black and white. I reached all my activity metrics for EUP’s and meetings, but not quite at 100%. She even wrote me up for it and put me on an improvement plan with threatening termination! How does threatening to fire someone help them improve! The worst part about it was my manager was newer in her role and had never been a rep in my position before nor had any sales experience!! So how could I feel like I’m taking advice from someone that’s been in my shoes to improve!! Talk about the blind leading the blind! Ultimately I felt backed into a corner and felt like I was going to be fired because my pipline wasn’t there and I was going to be fired so I left. This company is a complete hypocrite to what they teach you about business. How a business employees are their greatest asset and it’s cheaper to retain an employee than hire a new one. Yeah right. I was told that I was just a number and if I wasn’t at quota then I had to be let go. Dispite giving my best and trying. I mean I wasn’t even there a whole year yet!!! I was still in the learning phase! Responsible for the full ML pipeline, if there are pieces that aren't your cup of tea. Communication can be difficult in the remote environment.I have zero cons to report. wow where to start. compensation is a disaster. no one can predict what they will earn on a sale. partner sales are atrocious if your deal is under 60k don't even bother sending in smb. management is living on a different planet...from which they micromanage to all heck unless you make circle rep. promised six figures if you hit quota (funny bc I was 120% to quota and made less than 75k-which is less than ""OTE"") Be prepared to work 12 hour days for your first two years. as of Aug '23 70% of sales reps did not sell one unit over the last 3 months, and 80% of all revenue and units came from less than 10 sales reps out of over 800. yet management blames reps vs negligent overhiring practices and trying to stay out of the news for layoffs. also been part of a meeting (by accident) where upper management talks about reps as ""unintelligent"", ""lazy"" and ""not working hard"". good luck applicants! We aren’t being paid. This business uses an intentionally difficult to understand commission structure, that is impossible to audit or challenge in any meaningful way. New reps are sold into the organization with an expectation of unlimited earning potential and a myriad of compensation options, but those payments never arrive. Quotas go up, sometimes totally arbitrarily, and Comp structure changes each fiscal. They don’t bonus you on time, or accurately. Management will send you to HR for asking about where your money is, and HR will send you back to management. These issues were brought to regional management and upper level management over six months ago. We are still not being paid. Salary/Pay ranges tend to be lower than averages for markets and nationally. If you are not comfortable with change management philosophies, it can be difficult to keep up with being agile in your role's responsibilities and driving results. Very ""corporate"" not a small company, lots of rules to follow. Limited resources Technology Silo mentality ""Not my job"" Pay too many moving parts- sometimes no one takes accountability When I was hired, I was sold a dream that became a false reality. I was told that the best part about working at paychex was the exceptional culture and amazing work like balance. Couldn’t be further from the truth. For one, you feel like a chicken running around with its head cut off from all the different areas of focus they want you to implement. My main role was to sell payroll, which is complex being new, then they hammer you to be knowledgeable in other areas with HR and retirement and merchant service that you feel like you can’t ever become a subject expert in the one thing I was hired to sell which was payroll. Second, You are really just a number at this company. There is constant pressure to run faster and harder. They say selling season is the craziest month, but honestly they hammer you every month. You feel bad for taking anytime off because if you do, your meeting and eup numbers are down that week (naturally because you took time off) but then they expect you to come back and make up all your numbers you missed that week for for the month. It’s just all micromanaged down to the nth degree. You write multiple goals and commitment plans that are just iterations of the same thing that are a complete time waster. Third, don’t fall for the unlimited PTO BS. They make you feel bad for taking anytime off. It’s natural to not have as many meetings because you took time off! Don’t make employees feel like they can’t ever take time off when you sell them on unlimited PTO!!

Second, You are really just a number at this company. There is constant pressure to run faster and harder. They say selling season is the craziest month, but honestly they hammer you every month. You feel bad for taking anytime off because if you do, your meeting and eup numbers are down that week (naturally because you took time off) but then they expect you to come back and make up all your numbers you missed that week for for the month. It’s just all micromanaged down to the nth degree. You write multiple goals and commitment plans that are just iterations of the same thing that are a complete time waster. Third, don’t fall for the unlimited PTO BS. They make you feel bad for taking anytime off. It’s natural to not have as many meetings because you took time off! Don’t make employees feel like they can’t ever take time off when you sell them on unlimited PTO!! Fourth, the commission structure is so complicated that it’s hard to really determine how much you’re going to make on a sale. They change the structure too frequently too. When I was there they changed it to where if you didn’t hit 75% of units then you don’t get paid on any of those units you sold. That’s robbery in my opinion. You mean to tell me that if I bring in revenue for the company, I don’t get credit for it if it’s not a certain amount. Come one. Robbery. The mentorship program is useless. All my mentor did was show me how to submit a deal from the paperwork side. Which is overly complicated btw. Ultimately, I struggled to hit quota. My whole team struggle to hit quota regularly and then being new and having an underperforming territory that had 1.5 banks, because one was a solution branch, and CPA’s that hadn’t seen a paychex rep in 10yrs and took time to build trust, I struggle to hit quota. I still sold each month but not at 100%. Because of this my manager told me once I was off mentorship and there about 9 months if I wasn’t at 100% quota she had to let me go. After multiple conversations she told me it was black and white. I reached all my activity metrics for EUP’s and meetings, but not quite at 100%. She even wrote me up for it and put me on an improvement plan with threatening termination! How does threatening to fire someone help them improve! The worst part about it was my manager was newer in her role and had never been a rep in my position before nor had any sales experience!! So how could I feel like I’m taking advice from someone that’s been in my shoes to improve!! Talk about the blind leading the blind! Ultimately I felt backed into a corner and felt like I was going to be fired because my pipline wasn’t there and I was going to be fired so I left. This company is a complete hypocrite to what they teach you about business. How a business employees are their greatest asset and it’s cheaper to retain an employee than hire a new one. Yeah right. I was told that I was just a number and if I wasn’t at quota then I had to be let go. Dispite giving my best and trying. I mean I wasn’t even there a whole year yet!!! I was still in the learning phase! Salary/Pay ranges tend to be lower than averages for markets and nationally. If you are not comfortable with change management philosophies, it can be difficult to keep up with being agile in your role's responsibilities and driving results. Very ""corporate"" not a small company, lots of rules to follow. -Grossly underpaid. -Severely overworked. -The most unorganized company -Outspoken personality not desired. They want yes men and women who will not push back or question components that do not make sense. -Leadership does not need to have knowledge of job. -Managers are inadequate and do not offer any sense of guidance. -Stuck in the previous century when it comes to ways of doing things. Limited resources Technology Silo mentality ""Not my job"" Pay too many moving parts- sometimes no one takes accountability Responsible for the full ML pipeline, if there are pieces that aren't your cup of tea."

Not because I needed a job to support a family of 7 including myself. But the opportunities that's created within the company for their employees. XPO's benefits and the one that stood out the most with me is the Dependent Care never had that before and with 2 kids under the ages of 2 is great help. If you're anyone like me whose big on personal development in life or at work XPO University has a huge library on training and courses to help create and develop better leaders and an overall better person.

Personally I've only been with the company 5 months tomorrow but, I've came from being a dockworker for 3 of those months training to be a Team Lead 1 of those months to full fledge running my own Sector on a FAC shift which gets crazy. Just imagine my first 2 weeks as a dockworker I didn't think I would make being apart of a FAC shift . Without any full management training here I am killing it.

Short drives and great pay Feels like family. Drivers will help without asking. The vibe is good. The terminal is small for its size and will challenge you to be a better driver. Dispatchers are cool. Were all in this together. Show up on time, be ready to work and you will succeed XPO has a lot of potential. New CEO (former CIO) is the culture driver that retains me and many others. There is a growing culture than before. This company feels still start up in many ways with processes.

Don't let those kinds of people determine your success. Must work docks full either line haul or p&d HOT! HOT! HOT! Working in this environment especially off loading freight from trailers will challenge you. Bring plenty of fluids, towels and extra shirt.

My reasoning being that there is no second chances. You must be perfect or you will be wrote up/fired expeditiously. One of my friends dropped a trailer and no damage occurred. They reported it the next shift instead of immediately (they did not know about the 4 hr policy AND were not aware it was an accident as no damage occurred) and they were promptly let go. They did not believe it counted as an accident until they contacted a supervisor to ask if it was counted as an accident at XPO. They informed them that yes, indeed it still counted as an unreported accident. Therefore if you so much as jump your king pin or drag the landing gear doing a tug test you better report it. No damage happened but my friend was living proof it doesn’t matter. If you need a quick buck this company would work Flat out honesty: IT’S TOO FRIGGIN HOT out on the open-docks! Need large industrial-size fans mounted to keep air blowing and proper ventilation, especially in the spring/summer! The job itself can be very challenging most times and having to deal with extreme humidity makes it worse. XPO can afford to put fans in, regardless of whether they rent or own a terminal, so do it!! Furthermore, change the whole process of PRO-ing freight. It’s ridiculous how much freight has to be unloaded from trailers, separated, and then re-child PROed, and then loaded into the appropriate trailer(s)…wastes so much time! XPO has to and can change this! Finally, change your management system…very poor from what I saw. Need supervisors who know what they’re doing and can manage properly, even if that means having more than 1 supervisor especially for the outbound shift. Some supervisors are so focused on how a trailer is loaded when they need to focus on helping the staff get done! It’s pathetic when the shift is 12:00-8:30 PM and getting done at an average of 9:30-10:00 PM, or later, every night mostly. Insane! You have no life on second shift at XPO.

The job itself can be very challenging most times and having to deal with extreme humidity makes it worse. XPO can afford to put fans in, regardless of whether they rent or own a terminal, so do it!! Furthermore, change the whole process of PRO-ing freight. It’s ridiculous how much freight has to be unloaded from trailers, separated, and then re-child PROed, and then loaded into the appropriate trailer(s)…wastes so much time! XPO has to and can change this! Finally, change your management system…very poor from what I saw. Need supervisors who know what they’re doing and can manage properly, even if that means having more than 1 supervisor especially for the outbound shift. Some supervisors are so focused on how a trailer is loaded when they need to focus on helping the staff get done! It’s pathetic when the shift is 12:00-8:30 PM and getting done at an average of 9:30-10:00 PM, or later, every night mostly. Insane! You have no life on second shift at XPO.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMC-Entertainment-Reviews-E758.htm,"Lots of fun working there I've worked my fair share of minimum wage jobs, most of the time I would get 4 5-hour shifts throughout the week. With AMC, most shifts could be around 7-8 hours. Even with just 3 shifts, I would get more hours from working. Hours aside, AMC has always been a fun place to work. Lots of down time with easy tasks to bond with your coworkers, and, if you have a good lead to plan the rushes, they could be really fun. Working on set can be magical Intellectually stimulating work No two days are the same Good coworkers During non peak days (weekends,tues,fri)/hours/ seasons(everything but summer really, unless it’s a big movie) it’s pretty chill, steady stream on guest(that’s what we call them) or if it’s like Monday, then barely any. Was amazing experience to gain under my belt. Easy first job. The work itself was enjoyable and extremely easy once you got the hang of it. 50% off concessions and food. Free movie tickets. If you prefer by the numbers procedures and operations, then AMC is the perfect fit. A corporate culture where everything is laid out in an exacting fashion, focusing entirely on business. A magnitude of education, support, and guidance provided. Professionalism, measurable results, and an adherence to the company line are valued. Standard industry pay and benefits, with lucrative bonuses available at select locations. Plenty of opportunities to advance, if you are patient, fit in, and are willing to relocate. It’s honestly a really fun environment getting to work at AMC. If you’re a movie buff you get to hear about all the upcoming new movies and posters. You get a discount on theater snacks and free tickets! Unlimited free movie tickets and 50% off on concessions. Easy to learn new positions. Pretty solid hours during the summer. Chill, laid back environment and everyone is friendly and nice.Lots of fun working there I've worked my fair share of minimum wage jobs, most of the time I would get 4 5-hour shifts throughout the week.

AMC also pushes the crew to sell stubs accounts with little to no incentive for the workers. Extremely long hours Some legacy producers are toxic Constant changes All busy days are going to feel like a non stop rush because it’s a small theater. On top of that we usually don’t have enough people when it’s busy to help with everything and there will always be a fire that needs putting out (restocking, quick restroom checks, a guest needs something, a seat isn’t working). Closing sucks cuz we get out at like 1 or 2 am. Also my least favorite job is usshering (cleaning the theaters. But you have to keep in mind that by comparison to my other jobs that are similar, this is the easiest one. You just get a little complacent. Not the strongest management at times. 90% of the employees were children and treated the work place as Highschool, gossiping and bullying other employees including full grown adults. Those children are also very unprofessional and lack work ethic and do bare minimum to get by. Management doesn’t help much either when it comes to conflict with other employees. If you tend to be creative or open minded in your approach to business, AMC is not a good fit. There is little flexibility and no place for any dissenting opinions. The focus is entirely on the numbers, with the people and experience being little more than afterthoughts. Very easy to become lost, forgotten, or unappreciated within the big business corporate structure. The company's employee performance/potential evaluation places you in a literal classification box; you will never know where they have placed you on the grid or the reasoning behind their decision, but that classification defines your career path and the opportunities made available to you. It can be hard though when guests get upset about circumstances out of our control or they’re just having a bad day but overall I’d say it’s worth it. Instead of being front of house at this location there’s another option to work in the kitchen since it’s a dine in. Just in case employees don’t want to be as guest oriented there’s the option to be a cook but there is always much to do in the back and lots of cleaning to be done. Working hours will dramatically drop during the fall in comparison to the summer (30 hours per week to 8). Customers can be kind of rude depending on time of day.

But you have to keep in mind that by comparison to my other jobs that are similar, this is the easiest one. You just get a little complacent. Not the strongest management at times. 90% of the employees were children and treated the work place as Highschool, gossiping and bullying other employees including full grown adults. Those children are also very unprofessional and lack work ethic and do bare minimum to get by. Management doesn’t help much either when it comes to conflict with other employees. If you tend to be creative or open minded in your approach to business, AMC is not a good fit. There is little flexibility and no place for any dissenting opinions. The focus is entirely on the numbers, with the people and experience being little more than afterthoughts. Very easy to become lost, forgotten, or unappreciated within the big business corporate structure. The company's employee performance/potential evaluation places you in a literal classification box; you will never know where they have placed you on the grid or the reasoning behind their decision, but that classification defines your career path and the opportunities made available to you. It can be hard though when guests get upset about circumstances out of our control or they’re just having a bad day but overall I’d say it’s worth it. Instead of being front of house at this location there’s another option to work in the kitchen since it’s a dine in. Just in case employees don’t want to be as guest oriented there’s the option to be a cook but there is always much to do in the back and lots of cleaning to be done. Working hours will dramatically drop during the fall in comparison to the summer (30 hours per week to 8). Customers can be kind of rude depending on time of day. The pay is really minimal"

Low salary. Yearly salary increasing is low Base Salary could be higher, it is on the lower end of big company salaries in HU. HR lied during the job interview basically. Told them I don't want to work in a workplace where it's common to force poeple to do overtime or weekend work, where there is a toxin customer-and internal environment-, and where people are considered as tools and not individual humans ,with rights to have a life besides their job. They ensured me with big smiles that none of the above is part of the company culture. Yet from my first workday basically, it is the case. Overstressed and overloaded teams, and the managment does not care. But they expect you to deliver all projects and fulfill all irrealistic deadlines for customers. Internal colleagues and project team managers are also the embodyments of toxic people at the workplace, constantly ""escalating"" on other Bosch members just to look powerful and hide their own incompetencies. Will not stay here for long The Romanian branch has the inferiority complex when Germans come in. Too many meetings. This company is very good for beginning and closer to retirement 7 days a week 12 hour days Nothing as of now I can say Nothing bad found about company have not thought about it"

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/John-Deere-Reviews-E195.htm,Work/Life Balance Competitive compensation with great long term benefits. Orgnization is awesone and very good culture. Employees have ample professional development opportunities. Good work environment to go above and beyond and work on special projects. Good pay and the best plant manager I’ve worked with. Great company to work for Big/Well-known brand Good Engineering Decent place to start career Good exposure to problem-solving Good work life balance Good Pay Great for Development I loved working at John Deere. The compensation was very competitive and the work was enjoyable for a new grad engineer. Good management Good pay Good benefits Cares about employees Challenging work Working for John Deere (salary) is great. Lots of opportunities and leadership encourages you to apply for higher positions.,"Base pay at time may not seem very competitive. Locations Growth is little slower in terms of promotions Little room for professional growth (promotions) in environmental department without relocating. No career advancement for a while 1. Promotion after Labor Grade 7 becomes a matter of who you know. 2. Nepotism is very rife. I once worked at a location in which a daughter-in-law was sitting less than 10 feet away from the father-in-law. 3. Husband and wife in Supply Management sitting in the same office 4. POLITICS! POLITICS!! POLITICS!!! 5. Not a great place to stay for long otherwise you will be staring at retirement by the time you can get opportunity to get to certain Labor Grades. Within 3 years of my departure from Deere, my salary has grown by nearly 60K!!! 6. TOXIC environment in which you are just a number of you don't know the right people. 7. Lots of informants who go from person to person, seeking incriminating information to present to their godfathers for someone to be NAILED! 8. Disappearing benefits. Software is newish to John Deere There's a ton of employees so you feel like a number at times. Gets hot sometimes Rarely work Saturdays Cyclical business Too much focus on diversity given our Midwest demographics They still have some traditional business management when it comes to clothing restrictions like wearing shorts."
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Mastercard-Reviews-E3677.htm,"Mastercard cares about its employees. They actually listen to each of us no matter what position someone holds. Your career means something to management because its philosophy is individual's make the whole what it is. I will never regret leaving where I came from to be a part of this amazing company. Great culture and some of the best benefits in the world. Mastercard is a stable company that treats their employees well - incredible 401k match and there are many smart people that work here. Recognizable name for resume and a good place to start your career 1. A very diverse culture. 2. The PTO, benefits and salaries are very competitive. 3. They are a very innovative company taking your ideas and bringing them to fruition. 4. Lots of room for advancement, and managers are very supportive of development. 5. Lots of great opportunities for giving back to the community, surrounding areas and all over the world. 6. Flexible work schedules and work from home or anywhere options. I work from home several days a week, I am saving so much on gas and wear and tear on my car. Also, WFH helps with work life balance I am home when I could be sitting in traffic. 1. They treat you like adults. 2. The diverse culture is POSITIVE! You never hear that someone doesn't want to work today. The paid time off benefits are superlative. If you have a day you don't feel like working? Take a personal day with pay. You have plenty when you work here. 3. Advancement. If you don't grow here? You only have yourself to blame. Mastercard makes it a priority to help you grow and advance your career to whatever heights you seek. 4. Innovation. Have an idea? Awesome! Mastercard helps you bring it into fruition. You will have plenty of knowledgeable colleagues who want to help you along the way. 5. Make a difference. There are SO MANY ways to make a positive difference in your home, in your community and in the world here. Pick your preference. You'll have the best support system, you'll have the best cheerleaders and best LEADERS to help you. Mastercard’s benefits, opportunities to advance, ability to be flexible to employee needs, focus on implementing new technologies, and the strong product focus makes working at the company enjoyable and keeps things interesting. It’s a great way to learn and advance. I was there for 8 years in various roles. I enjoyed the vision and culture under Ajay Banga’s leadership greatly, and was sad to see him leave. Very smart employees to work with and learn from. Good Pay, Excellent Benefits, That's it. Great benefits and start up salaries. I do recommend learning fast and getting involve with other teams/departments if you want to move up. Invinting nature that served as a great first professional job","I don't have anything but good things to say about Mastercard. Lower pay than some top tech companies but better than average by a good margin. There are essentially two groups at Mastercard - the folks who value stability and are lifers and those who join after buying the positioning of MA being an innovative company and leave within 3 years. In my experience, if you are looking to be inspired it will be hard to find within the EVP leadership team who are political and not strategic thinkers. Constant priority churn to try to meet short term revenue targets and try to make ROI from the train wreck of acquisitions done over the course of the last few years, a complete lack of vision in what should be the more innovative teams, silos abound as does busywork and inside out thinking, and despite talk of transparency and working together there is little to no leadership to fulfill that vision - but plenty of name dropping of who talked to the CEO or last. Very slow moving technology process that will drive anyone coming from an actual agile organization mad and severely outdated business processes that will be unrecognizable for anyone coming from a high growth SAAS company No cons in the 15 years I’ve worked here, MC has been amazing to me, hoping for another 15. You'll never want to leave. The flexible hours and flexible work from home option will make you work more. You'll WANT to, because Mastercard is so good to you. The cons of working at Mastercard are the politics and bureaucracy in the Operations, Networking , and Employee Digital Experience (ONE) organization. The ONE organization has poor executive leadership that has a culture of nepotism/cliques and corporate bullying. My last few months, people who reported misconduct or disagreed with the CTO were put on a list and their jobs eliminated. Don’t report anything to HR or ethics - they are not your friend. There is a lack of training, and when large transformation efforts are rolled out, people are expected to learn on their own - they roll things out or start initiatives without much consideration for adoption and change management with their employees. I self taught and spent time trying to educate senior leadership to understand the impact - they expect a check mark and don’t really value the mindset of exemplifying change from the top. There is no work-life balance - I was working between 60-80 hours and wearing multiple hats. When I spoke up, and set boundaries, my manager’s behavior changed and I felt I had a target on my back in every meeting. There is a strong lack of company appreciation around employees. Some managers are good at recognition, but most not so much, especially senior leaders. There is a strong focus on meeting objectives without regard and reward for people going the extra mile. There is a lack of accountability culture, and when you hold peers accountable for the responsibility they signed up, they get offended and hate you. Coworkers like to throw people under the bus, and if you are a manager don’t share anything with your peers or direct reports - there is a gossip culture and people will do anything to get ahead. For women in tech, if you are assertive and just doing your job, good luck advancing as you will be painted like a villain while your male colleagues can get away with unprofessional behavior. Opportunities to advance hard to come by. Too many VP’s. Manager is non-existent Team members are nit-picking, micro-managing, and rude No on-boarding, just thrown into the deep end General attitude is ""not my ticket, not my problem"", you will get next to no help. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE, ESPECIALLY THE KUBERNETES TEAM Rotation of managers is crazy. Managers and directors are moved/fired/terminated quickly. I had 3 managers and 3 directors in 3 years. Some management can be indirect and that doesn't help with individual growth"

PTO is unlimited but as a sales rep you should be pacing at a good rate towards your quota for you to feel confident in asking for time off. Some of those tougher quarters can begin to feel like burnout because you're afraid take some time off to reset. However the perks at Indeed help lighten the load. Do not believe what they are selling that they care about you as a person. Indeed only cares about one thing..money. The recent layoffs should be proof of that. For years I was under the belief they cared about employees mental health and then I started to see through it. If you have a bad quarter or two..then you are a liability to the company. Micro management is huge here and they make you hit stupid metrics even if you are pacing to hit your goal. Indeed only surfacely cares about their employees well being but deep down is just like every other corporation where profits are more important than people..and you know it.

It's sad to see - if you hire rock stars, let them lead and let them do what they do best. Recently, Indeed has gone through some changes to their business model to be a leaner organization.

Although they provide good benefits, there are roles within the company that are severely underpaid.

Also, there are many high level leaders that appear to do nothing. I see no evidence that these leaders provide value. Big growth over the past couple of years means growing pains. Middle management of engineering orgs around the director/VP level is catty and power grabbing, leading to constant reorgs and similar initiatives run simultaneously by different orgs. Because the company at a high level tries to do well by employees, lots of denial of problems and drinking of the koolaid at lower levels of management. If you receive a job offer and they offer you a title lower than you want but claim you'll get the title in a year/6 months, it's a lie. Literally does not happen. Either tell them you'll only accept the role with the title you want or walk. That title is important because it determines pay bands. I watched this happen to several engineers who were then bitter for the rest of their time at the company as a result. There's a sexism issue in the engineering org. No harassment or anything like that, but women's careers advance slower than men's careers do by an obvious amount. I watched several skilled female engineers and managers leave the company because they weren't properly valued/taken seriously. As a result, there are very few women in higher level engineering roles, even at the senior level. The only L4 or higher female engineers I worked with were transwomen who got to that level before they came out. Strange emphasis on hiring women for lower level engineering roles without the backup of seeking out experienced women already in the industry. If you are considering an SRE role, don't join this company until you've asked some very pointed questions. You'll be worked to the bone covering literally everyone's on calls on top of the rest of your role. They started making some changes to their on call system this year, but I would really vet the opportunity. Indeed ran its revenue into the ground with ill-conceived products and a hubris from executive leadership that resulted in the layoffs of 15% of its workforce. There are/were very deserving people at this company that were overqualified for a promotion, but were stuck in the same role for 3-5 years without a promotion. Rather than promoting from within to people that had earned it, they hired people externally. They'll do whatever they have to to protect the business. Your loyalty to the company means nothing. You're expendable, and the management team makes that known. You MUST accept what you're being told to do. Not open to other suggestions or possible other ways to complete a task. IMPORTANT: If you lean right politically, you're not really welcome at this company. The CEO doesn't even try to hide it in his regular Q&As with the company. He has a political belief, and you best follow it. They shove political ideology down everybody's throat in the name of diversity and inclusion, but they don't even try to hide the fact that they would rather you be anything other than a straight, white, male.No cons for this place As it gets larger more and more KPI’s to keep hitting Do not believe what they are selling that they care about you as a person.

Also, there are many high level leaders that appear to do nothing. I see no evidence that these leaders provide value. Big growth over the past couple of years means growing pains. Middle management of engineering orgs around the director/VP level is catty and power grabbing, leading to constant reorgs and similar initiatives run simultaneously by different orgs. Because the company at a high level tries to do well by employees, lots of denial of problems and drinking of the koolaid at lower levels of management. If you receive a job offer and they offer you a title lower than you want but claim you'll get the title in a year/6 months, it's a lie. Literally does not happen. Either tell them you'll only accept the role with the title you want or walk. That title is important because it determines pay bands. I watched this happen to several engineers who were then bitter for the rest of their time at the company as a result. There's a sexism issue in the engineering org. No harassment or anything like that, but women's careers advance slower than men's careers do by an obvious amount. I watched several skilled female engineers and managers leave the company because they weren't properly valued/taken seriously. As a result, there are very few women in higher level engineering roles, even at the senior level. The only L4 or higher female engineers I worked with were transwomen who got to that level before they came out. Strange emphasis on hiring women for lower level engineering roles without the backup of seeking out experienced women already in the industry. If you are considering an SRE role, don't join this company until you've asked some very pointed questions. You'll be worked to the bone covering literally everyone's on calls on top of the rest of your role. They started making some changes to their on call system this year, but I would really vet the opportunity. Indeed ran its revenue into the ground with ill-conceived products and a hubris from executive leadership that resulted in the layoffs of 15% of its workforce. There are/were very deserving people at this company that were overqualified for a promotion, but were stuck in the same role for 3-5 years without a promotion. Rather than promoting from within to people that had earned it, they hired people externally. They'll do whatever they have to to protect the business. Your loyalty to the company means nothing. You're expendable, and the management team makes that known. You MUST accept what you're being told to do. Not open to other suggestions or possible other ways to complete a task. IMPORTANT: If you lean right politically, you're not really welcome at this company. The CEO doesn't even try to hide it in his regular Q&As with the company. He has a political belief, and you best follow it. They shove political ideology down everybody's throat in the name of diversity and inclusion, but they don't even try to hide the fact that they would rather you be anything other than a straight, white, male.No cons for this place not the most competitive pay Sales in any company will always have an aspect to it that is stressful.

The company culture is inclusive and welcoming, and I feel a sense of connection and belonging among my colleagues. - Onboarding process is the best I have ever had - The experimentation framework is decent - Some strong engineers and data scientists - Compensation and benefits are great, though RSUs are not promising Some of the people was strange not friendly - smaller team sizes - easier to find projects you're passionate about - promo process is clear People are friendly and willing to help Emphasis on mental health and PTO Get to work on cool projects Competitive pay, lovely teammates, great managers. Pros? Good benefits. Generally nice people. It looks good on a resume. You can get your foot into the door of tech here. It's generally easy. As long as you avoid ANYTHING customer service related, seriously, don't work those positions at Lyft. They're terrible, exhausting, demoralizing, and impossible to escape from internally.

Additionally, there are pressures from drivers who want full-time employment and the benefits that come with it, such as health insurance. While the team is intelligent, decision-making can often be a slow process. - Pink flavor of toxic Uber - obvious because a lot of folks here are ex-Uber. - Company will never be profitable - Engineers & PMs here are arrogant, toxic and political. They browbeat each other, torpedo each other's work, gossip, yell, falsely blame each other etc. This is the only company I have worked where the politics exists at the engineer/PM-level. Because the management is desperate to retain talent, if you are smart & arrogant you will be shielded at the expense of other employees. - The arrogance of the engineers does not match their talent level. Merely clever engineers, but lacking in maturity, experience and intellectual humility. If they worked at a place like Google, they will be humbled in a day. - My PM was a plagiarist and dating another PM in the same team, leading to all kinds of weird interactions but HR and upper management would not fix it. - Token DEI hires who do not meet the bar. Well if you like drive when you want it great for that Not. For sure who was was being pick up do to someone else was paying for the ride - leadership doesnt know what theyre doing Company’s changed a lot after the pandemic and economy issues The leadership (David Risher, as well as those immediately under him) is driving the company to the ground. After two layoffs in less than six months, the company morale is at an all time low. Everyone around me is interviewing or have already left. Someone raised this concern to the leadership and all they said was “we are keeping an eye on the situation.” And? Aren’t you gonna do something to keep people from leaving? Oh right, they cut our comp by 10-20%. Great call. By the way, stay away from this company if you’re on H1b and want a green card. I have coworkers who were waiting to file their PERM, but the two layoffs really messed it up, because after each layoff, the company has to wait 180 days before they can file again. The April layoff happened less than 180 days after the November one, so they now have to wait another 180 days. That’s a whole freaking year. And they told me their H1b is only valid for 6 years in total. The leadership clearly doesn’t care about its international employees. Be aware if someone's giving you a referral. You get a $1000 bonus for referring someone who gets hired, so make sure it's someone you trust who's giving you the scoop on what it's like to work at Lyft. Really hard to move up. Management will tell you whatever they need to to keep you placated. Pay is trash. Comp for similar roles in my area paid 20k higher Many roles are catch-all roles, where you do a little bit of what you'd expect, then a hundred other random tasks that someone needs to have done, and you can't say no to them. Inequality/bias happens. I found out that since I was in internal hire, I was paid a LOT less (15k less) than a new hire on our team who was 5 years less experienced than me. That stung. I negotiated for a raise and got a flat-out no. The company is in a tough spot in this economy, so they blame that on why they won't give raises.

And they told me their H1b is only valid for 6 years in total. The leadership clearly doesn’t care about its international employees. Be aware if someone's giving you a referral. You get a $1000 bonus for referring someone who gets hired, so make sure it's someone you trust who's giving you the scoop on what it's like to work at Lyft. Really hard to move up. Management will tell you whatever they need to to keep you placated. Pay is trash. Comp for similar roles in my area paid 20k higher Many roles are catch-all roles, where you do a little bit of what you'd expect, then a hundred other random tasks that someone needs to have done, and you can't say no to them. Inequality/bias happens. I found out that since I was in internal hire, I was paid a LOT less (15k less) than a new hire on our team who was 5 years less experienced than me. That stung. I negotiated for a raise and got a flat-out no. The company is in a tough spot in this economy, so they blame that on why they won't give raises. They're also making virtual employees go back in office. I was really glad to be laid off in April. Rarely a crappy passenger but that’s rarely Everyone was let go and no longer exists.- bad leader - bad future - Pink flavor of toxic Uber - obvious because a lot of folks here are ex-Uber. - Company will never be profitable - Engineers & PMs here are arrogant, toxic and political. They browbeat each other, torpedo each other's work, gossip, yell, falsely blame each other etc. This is the only company I have worked where the politics exists at the engineer/PM-level. Because the management is desperate to retain talent, if you are smart & arrogant you will be shielded at the expense of other employees. - The arrogance of the engineers does not match their talent level. Merely clever engineers, but lacking in maturity, experience and intellectual humility. If they worked at a place like Google, they will be humbled in a day. - My PM was a plagiarist and dating another PM in the same team, leading to all kinds of weird interactions but HR and upper management would not fix it. - Token DEI hires who do not meet the bar. The Rideshare industry seems to face constant difficulties with profitability, and the pandemic has had a significant impact on the business. Additionally, there are pressures from drivers who want full-time employment and the benefits that come with it, such as health insurance. While the team is intelligent, decision-making can often be a slow process. The leadership (David Risher, as well as those immediately under him) is driving the company to the ground. After two layoffs in less than six months, the company morale is at an all time low. Everyone around me is interviewing or have already left. Someone raised this concern to the leadership and all they said was “we are keeping an eye on the situation.” And? Aren’t you gonna do something to keep people from leaving? Oh right, they cut our comp by 10-20%. Great call. By the way, stay away from this company if you’re on H1b and want a green card.

For sure who was was being pick up do to someone else was paying for the ride Some leads are not great Lack of Growth No Lyft Credit - leadership doesnt know what theyre doing Passengers can (and do) make up complaints about you in order to get free rides.

Dealing with Rejection: As a recruiter, you frequently encounter situations where candidates are not selected for a particular role. Delivering rejection news and managing disappointed or frustrated candidates can be emotionally draining and challenging. Unpredictable Work Hours: Recruiting often involves working outside traditional office hours, especially when coordinating interviews with candidates who have other commitments. This can lead to irregular work schedules, making work-life balance more difficult. Competitive Industry: The recruiting industry is highly competitive, with numerous recruitment agencies and in-house recruiting teams vying for top talent. This can result in fierce competition for clients and job placements, which may add extra pressure to your role. Administrative Tasks: Recruiting involves a significant amount of administrative work, such as managing applicant tracking systems, reviewing resumes, scheduling interviews, and coordinating with various stakeholders. The administrative workload can sometimes feel overwhelming and time-consuming. Responsible for a very large work load. None really. Occasional weekend work if busy sprint schedule but otherwise fine."

If you don't greet someone within 15 seconds, you get points counted off. If a manager doesn't say hi to a guest, you get points counted off. You can also not leave the bar, but if the food doesn't make it to a guest in time, you get points counted off. You also can't grab anyone bread, or you get points counted off. You are at the mercy of yelling at servers to help you. If you are busy making drinks for the entire restaurant and can't make ""engaging conversation"", you get points counted off. There is also no tip out for bartenders, even though you're required to make drinks for the entire restaurant.

My manager is someone who barely has experience as group lead and micromanages. In one sentence some are more equal than others- just like 1984.... It can be very demanding at times Many of the good leaders/managers left when the company got bought out. The entire senior leadership team at the site turned over almost 2 full times the year or so following. What made this place special disappeared when the people that built that culture left. I sat in on leadership meetings and the way that they spoke about their team was rude at best. There were bright spots in my time with the company but it was overshadowed by the last few years I was there. Common practice to jump people 2+ promotions at once to try and hold on to them but the way they chose those folks were by who the senior leadership team liked the most and not necessarily who would be a good leader or good fit for the role. It is honestly sad to see such a neat place rot away to what it has become. Too much politics and favoritism by quad managers. 1) The company culture might not be enforced by some managers. Depending on the manager it could be a fear culture and you need to be a yes person all the time. If you have a great manager, it could be one of the best companies to work. 2) Layoff and reorganizations are constant, every two years there were reorgs, layoffs, department title changes, and change in management, and more. 3) The 2023 & 2024 layoff are all about saving money. It doesn't matter if you were a top performer, or that you were loyal to the company for 10 or 30 years, those are the ones that they are targeting. Then they are consolidating two or four roles in one (insane amount of work) and hiring new people to offer less money. 4) During my 10 years with the company I observed that many employees that implemented new projects/processes/ initiatives and were successful, were later replaced after everything was settle down. That happened with me as well and my responsibilities were given to a new person that not even closely matches my experience as skills, but it is cheaper. 5) HR does not have controls in place to identify and avoid that top performers be targeted by new management. From being a top performer most of my year and having a great reputation about the quality of my job everything changed after a new manager came in and within 6 months, I ended with the only bad evaluation that I ever had in the company. Ironically, I implemented two new initiatives that year and even saved money to the company but that wasn't important any longer. If the new manager wants to build a new team or doesn't feel good about having top performers reporting to them, they will target you providing a poor score on values and then including your position for elimination. 6) If you wnt to grow you need to be located in NJ. The industry nickname for BMS is Disney Land. If you want to fast track your career by 10 years, BMS will hire you as a senior leader. This is due to significant amount of inexperienced leaders hiring inexperienced individuals. I have never seen so many directors, SD, ED in my 20 year career. Of all the companies out there involved in CAR T they are the most disorganized. Site level leadership operate at the levels of supervisors and managers but carry around big titles. There is zero strategy and thoughtfulness behind decision making. Unfortunately the senior level are where the biggest problems lay.

I was told I’d be 1st, then 2nd, then 3rd shift. Many of the individuals in the company don’t know how to do their job. Many of the new hires are very lazy.
