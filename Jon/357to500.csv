https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Northwell-Health-Reviews-E1142964.htm,"Management does go out of their way to help you with any issues you run into and they support you when facing challenges. They also are very supportive of career advancement!
Good support present for staff
PTO ease of being able to transfer to other departments/hospitals
A very oiled machine, led by a visionary leader
Co workers, environment, salary, locations,
Good benefits Access to multiple sources and different providers
organization is willing to adapt better practices in some areas
Parties at work sometimes are a thing. Especially the Super Bowl Party. Summer hours
They pay higher than market rate for administrative assistants, but the standards are high and the work can be stressful. If you can manage your time effectively and stay organized it'll be easier for you. . Northwell does go out of their way to show appreciation for its employees and it does go along way. Working for this company was stressful, but I always felt valued. Most admin jobs in healthcare right now pay $18 per hour, Northwell pays $22 per hour. Patients come first, this makes my job easier when patients feel like they matter.
Pay was good, union benefits, plenty of opportunity for advancement... amazing coworkers that made the toughest days manageable
Can’t speak for all management teams but there are great leadership members - recent pay increase but would be great if it was more due to inflation rates and cost of living
Fun environment to work in with great colleagues
Friendly staff and flexible, nice work environment
Great coworkers day and night, average pay
Good benefits (PTO, insurance, etc.) and flexible work schedule
The nurses are willing to help you become the best possible aide
The pros included a wonderful health care facility to work for.
Benefits, PTO, Infertility Coverage, Sick Time, Flexibility in scheduling
Big network for you to move employee
I really hate Northwell direct insurance it feels like the ceo isn’t big on the best interest of the worker but the best interest for his finances he made it so Nyu hospitals and doctors will not be covered at all how selfish of whoever made this it seems like we got the worst and cheapest insurance!!
They recently just updated their pay structure for RN's so that it's more competitive.
I worked with great team and my managers were also great.

Great place to work in my opinion
Benefits are great for union
Management does go out of their way to help you with any issues you run into and they support you when facing challenges. They also are very supportive of career advancement!
I’ve been here for 7 years this July and I’ve grown over the years starting out as a flex staff medical office assistant to now a lead administrative support coordinator. I’ve worked and currently work with such amazing people who’ve become family to me. Northwell takes care of its employees. I’m genuinely happy to go to work and enjoy my job and co workers.
Great coworkers, easy to pick up shifts, pays very well, and teachable atmosphere

","A lot of the equipment is a little outdated.
Staffing issues and ratios too high for acuity
current medical insurance isn’t the best.
Non-whites are usually not promoted as quickly as their counterparts.
patient to staff ratios are high
Salaries could be more competitive
depends on your dept senior management on how your experience will be. i've had the best of the best. and the worst of the worst
Where do I start with this terrible company and this terrible job. Upon working here I can say many things. The higher ups starting from the supervisors in the CBO (Central Business Office) are honestly the most ridiculous people I have ever come across in my entire life. They think that the best way to have people stay within the company is to give them more work when already the standard is high. When I left they were saying that 22 claims a day isn't good enough and they were requesting more of them to get done per day and I have heard from my former colleagues that its gone up since with no compensation for the amount of work that you have to do get a higher amount of claims done. Prior to the pandemic they had also mentioned that Veterans Day ""isn't a real holiday and that they don't know why its celebrated"". When covid did happen they had advised us straight to our face that ""we were lucky to have a job"". The only time they give any semblance for one's progression through the company is during Press Gainey time. For those of you reading this the Press Gainey survey is how they determine how happy the employees are and be sure that they care ""so much about your career"" during this time and they're saying how they want to ""help you grow"" and then the minute that your done with that survey they can legitimately care less about it as long as you give them a good score. Prior to leaving this company because of the Press Gainey scores being so low within the CBO they actually that that the best way to make the scores go up is by adding in a Wall of Recognition which is equivalent to getting a gold star in an elementary school. The next thing is that when you do want to move up they will do their very best to screw you over in every way possible and on top of that the only people who get promoted are people who are friends with the higher up people. They don't care about merit, they don't care about what degree you have or if you even have one, and they don't care about the work you do. As long as you fall in line and give them your numbers they WILL NOT promote you. My first week working there I was told if I don't get promoted within 2 years or leave then my feet will be stuck in cement and this was coming from a senior rep mind you. This company and job is something that I will NEVER return to and please heed my warning Northwell does not care about you or your well being.
Their structure changed after the pandemic, front desk, surgical coordinators, and billers became administrative assistants and everyone is cross trained to do multiple jobs in the event someone is out sick for an extended period of time. If you are applying for roles within Northwell your manager will find out, can stop you from leaving. Sometimes it's easier to just move onto another company. Also, if you start with their temp agency, get hired, and move on to another job not within the company you cannot get back in through the temp agency
Managers with morals and high employee satisfaction rates get fired.
Short staffed Some management won’t let more than 1 nurse off for PTO
Not enough opportunities for growth
No gaurentted hours every week
Short staffed too many days
Pay does not match other hospital systems and the raises are not as competitive either.
Parking lot and reconstruction of the hospital has been taking way too long
There were no cons. I enjoyed my work experience.
Promotion if you know the higher ups.
Low pay compared to nyu
The health insurance is expensive and hardly covers anythingBUT ……Northwell
Staffing still is rough, but then again most places in healthcare ""post""-covid world are sadly...
The pay is not satisfying.
unrealistic expectations, could never call out , burnout, high stress, pressure
Work-life balance, lack of infrastructure in young programs, wear too many hats

Never enough staffing. They are the largest hospital in the system yet VERY stingy. They will hire contract nurses with much higher pay who do not have the same capacity as us ( handle more critical pts) which makes the load just as heavy.
nothing at all.. great leadership
Lower pay Over saturation of markets
Short staffed too many days
Outdated management styles in some department. Resistance to change and technology advancement. Compensation is too low in this current market.
A lot of favoritism, pettiness, unfairness going on in this company. You are nothing but a number here, the HR department and the managers are arrogant and your voice does not matter to them unless you have a higher position. If you work under FlexStaff, good luck getting a permanent position here, people wait for a year and nothing. Of course they will say it’s out of your performance, but it’s not, it just depends if they like you, which is so horrible because not most people have time to be a “management pet”. They fire employees easy as if the employees aren’t human beings who have families. The last thing they care about is employees, especially if you’re starting from below, you’re nothing to them and believe it or not, they’ll talk to you without respect especially if you made a mistake. Bunch of dictators and hypocrites.
Work-life balance, lack of infrastructure in young programs, wear too many hats
No pension benefits Non union
They will keep giving you more work without any pay increase.

The sight takes on more patients that it can actually accommodate on a day to day basis
No pension benefits Non union
They will keep giving you more work without any pay increase.
Compensation is average, they say that the benefits out way that
-Some departments have favoritism. -They make non 365 employees pay for benefits while 365 employees get it for free. -Northwell direct insurance members have to use Northwell providers and it causes long waits for appointments.
I can't think of anything
I cant think of any Cons at the moment.
Work every weekend, night shift.
No room for growth/stagnant/no way to have a career change within the system unless you know someone within the department you would like to be apart of. Yearly raises are $1 dollar Hardly any promotions even if you are a stellar worker and have excellent performance reviews.
Short Staffing is often, ICU nurses get floated to step down units Surgeons speak down to nursing staff and nothing is done about it Disorganized at times
Management is garbage hospital is garbage
The pay. The leadership (poor communication).
Low salary, not so good benefits
Stuck in position for 1 year before you’re able to move/get promoted/etc. hard to make own dr appts as their hours are the same as your work hours. Repetitive work. even if you have multiple years of experience, if you don’t have specific healthcare experience they start you at the bottom.

No cons I can think of
Salary is not up to rest of Long Island
A lot of the equipment is a little outdated.
Work life balance sometimes not knowing g when to leave work at work
Sometimes difficult patients. And hard floors to work on. But the staff makes it manageable.
Long hours, low salary— but that’s medical residency
Coworkers Management Patient to nurse ratio
No stable schedule, toxic work environment, bad management, low pay is not worth the amount of work they make you do. Patients are beyond rude, demanding, and entitled. No organization within the office. Doctors are not cooperative
as a manager there is no room for growth in your salary
little room for upward mobility, most scribes advance via PA, NP, RN, MD/DO programs
- not union have to pay a lot for insurance monthly
Very busy and fast paced hospital
May be difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Benefits are subpar compared to the local competitors.
- Team was stuck in a very small, congested office - Employees do not work your typical 9-5, they work 10-14 hours daily, plus weekends to manage projects - The team was so overwhelmed and almost everyone had anxiety or saw a therapist - The workload was extreme; clearly, they were understaffed - No work-life balance. Someone said ""my child is old enough to raise themselves"" - Those who have been there for lengthy periods and have watched the company grow, withhold information from the newer employees which created a hostile environment - They promote diversity and inclusion but it is clear that their teams are separated by race, socioeconomic status, and seniority - Favoritism and nepotism: People hire their family members and friends to work on the same team and it created hostility when the blue-collar workers tried to address management's behavior - Punishment for managers who violate blue-collar workers' contracts is not taken seriously and is unjust in comparison to blue-collars violating their contract for management (unfair practices)
Bad communication from team and from corporate.

When I started it was lively and fun. By the time I left it felt there was a cloud of misery over the whole place. Nobody smiled. There was no sense of cohesiveness. Pizza lunches and free Northwell-branded items every so often were just a token ""thank you"" from management. You definitely felt unappreciated. Your time was not important to them. Senior leadership makes you feel like you are never good enough or smart enough.
Pay is not enough at this place
no cons, have not started yet
Insurance is by good if they are under system. If not, better to pray because either they won’t accept you or your copay will be high as the sky.
health insurance benefits Non union
Might take some time to move up
little room for upward mobility, most scribes advance via PA, NP, RN, MD/DO programs

-slow HR department -outdated, slow computer systems -overtime is VERY office dependent, not universal -compensation below NYC standards for healthcare for administrative positions

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Zara-Reviews-E17544.htm,"decent pay , Good environment
- Great pay for college students - Flexible with hours
They have a really good employee discount, and their clothes are expensive so it helps! Commission is store wide, so you can just work in the back and get commission on the percentage of sales sold that day. They don't force you to speak to customers and hound customers. They truly believe in being around if assistance is needed, which I love because must shoppers know why they are there!
Employee discount is okay, 25% but you can use it at other inditex brands. Medical is free even for part timers, dental or vision you have to pay for. Great coworkers
The will hire most people with just one interview
Very positive managers that practice open communication. Expectations were clear and it was a peaceful place to work! Loved the employee discount as well- I probably made hardly any money working there since I was putting it to so much use.
flexible hours Good pay Good work
Think it would be a good segway to eventually move up to a designer brand store. Coworkers are friendly. Management is cool if you're cool and putting in the work you're supposed to. Pretty decent
The workers have a Union
Good pay and able to acquire overtime

Great position and union that fought for a pay raise within a few months of starting at Zara. Great teammates, great communication with management. Flexible hours. Zara is neutral about unions which is a plus I hope that doesn’t change. Stocking devices are A+ Training is simple and easy and they love questions.

Great hours and cool place to work
Discount coworkers customers enjoy it
Coworkers and managers were really nice and it was a fun place to work at.
","Bad Management overwhelming at times
- employee turnover - management sucks - very strict - lack of communication between employee and management as well as a lack of communication between management.
There wore a lot of problematic things that occurred, however a lot even at the time seemed based on ignorance. I pray that that has changed since I worked there. Over the past few years , we as a country learned how words and policies can affect different cultures, and that some policies that may have created to be exclusive would have to be altered in other to make every ethnicity, religion, creed, and orientation feel welcome. However a lot of the languages and policies seemed to ignore the changes that we as a society have made. Hopefully, that aspect has seen improvement.
Customers are probably the worst people in the world, mangers need to better communicate with each other, and some managers need to stand up for their employees more.
Horrendously busy and understaffed and messy and you get one day of training then its right to work. It just seems like it not worth it and you're better off working at another store for less.
Sometimes there were issues of being scheduled on days I communicated in advance that I couldn't. Was hard finding people to cover for those shifts and it was frustrating.
workload is alot customers tiring
I can't say anything that was too bad. I mean it can get a little hectic during holidays but other than that nothing
The job is Short staffed
there can sometimes be employee drama
I can't say anything that was too bad. I mean it can get a little hectic during holidays but other than that nothing
The job is Short staffed
They press you about uniform they don’t give.
there can sometimes be employee drama
Inflexible hours and very demanding results for very little pay
-bad management -rude customers -somewhat lenient with scheduling
Needs better management when handling employee conflicts
Management , rotating hours, low salary, nasty customers .
The costumers can be rude at times
Walkie talkies aren’t always in the best shape but it’s not that big of a deal. Sometimes co workers need stock checks within the minute which is hard to do. Laundry Jet has broken down twice within a year which is sad because it’s essential to working in the stock room but management is usually quick to fix it. Sometimes all you do is hang replenishment or change hangers when there are no clip hangers or thin hangers but it’s an essential part of the job. Not much to complain about really.
- Customers are rude, messy, and conceited. I cannot emphasize enough how god awfully annoying the customers were. My biggest grievance with my time at Zara has a lot to do with the customers but also ties in a lot to my second bullet which has to do with why management makes the customers extra annoying to deal with. - Management will tell you to act with protocol but take the customers side when it comes down to it, making you look like you weren't doing your job correctly. I have been in so many situations where the managers have told me to reply specifically about return policies or people not having what they need for returns, etc... More often then not, Zara policy leaves customers annoyed an berating the cashiers. To which they will often say they want to speak with a manager and the manager just comes with this super sweet disposition and just takes the customers side and you are left with the nastiness of the customer even though you are replying and working exactly how you are told to. - There is a usual crew that are more ""long-term"" workers at Zara and they are pretty cliquey if you are a newer face. A lot of the workers were generally nice but in a artificial way. Most of them hangout with who they know and that's it. So, if you are a newer worker, please do expect to be iced for a while before someone decides to be friendly. - During peak seasonal sales, they will literally get you to work overtime (i.e. until 12 AM). You have to manually put a sale sticker on every single item on the floor that is being marked down for sale. - Closing out registers is incredibly annoying and a job that you will probably experience if you are a cashier and working a closing shift. If a register that was worked on by another cashier does not add up correctly, all cashiers are scolded. - There are certain days where the store is absolutely packed and the lines are disgustingly long. You have to take transaction after transaction for hours and hours. - Having to take returns is the worst. You have to rescan every single piece of clothing and for whatever reason, people who shop at Zara are just effortlessly annoying and like to return 100 pieces of clothing they somehow afforded to buy online.
It was not permanent position
They press you about uniform they don’t give.
Inflexible hours and very demanding results for very little pay
-bad management -rude customers -somewhat lenient with scheduling
Management , rotating hours, low salary, nasty customers .
Somewhat disorganized They will get upset at you if you somehow manage to switch your schedule around with other team members
Unorganized work environment, lack of proper training for new employees, customer service is encouraged to be disregarded in order to attend to more important tasks
Work life balance is hard
Sales sales sales sAles salws
The pay could have been more for the amount of hours given.
The general services team is the most overworked and underpaid. The people in charge also don’t care if you submit complaints to HR about the director of your team - even if multiple people have done it over several years. The team is berated and bullied, expected to work 24/7 with no comp days or anything else and are living in a workplace culture with harassment and bullying. I’d never recommend this culture on my worst enemy. Glad I left.
Very overwhelming at times. Underpaid
short lunch breaks pay wasn’t worth the amount of work
The customers and hours suck
always spoke Spanish among them
such rude managers for no reason
Not the best management. Too many rude customers
Rude customers Understaffed at times Hard to grow unless you bother your manager a lot
It was understaffed. Management didnt always agree with each other
some management wasn’t very good
Management is not too good, very busy location and it is very disorganized
Bad enviroment, toxic Manager and cowokers
Not open for practical solutions
Fast paced environment Sometimes understaffed
Very busy and a lot of customers
- the store I worked at was at a busy location - too many managers and had a lot of miscommunication - overworked
Hours, lo cation, custome rs, food
Took almost a month from when they hired me and received my paperwork to when they scheduled me - which given that it was a seasonal position is a bit slow in my opinion.
Lots of Work Always super busy Many things to do
Zara is not your life but the management is insistent on making Zara the sum of your life. Not cool.
Not flexible with weekends and schedules.
Bad communication between managers and supervisors.
The pay could have been more for the amount of hours given.
Low pay and hard work
Not managed well and very erratic
During sale season, this store would become a complete mess (worse than other locations), FIX THE AC... cheap company,
Managent was not that organized
Very overwhelming at times. Underpaid
Hectic and confusing most times
there are too many to break down
Workload can be a lot and hours can be right under full time
Management hired me in the middle of sale season and didn't bother giving me any formal training before berating me for not knowing how to perform many of the tasks that required training.
Not the best management. Too many rude customers
Zara customers are another breed. They are always so entitled and treat our workers poorly.
Managers can be clicky and choose favorites
customers were always rude and messy
you will never grow with the company.
not the best workplace among retailers
You do to much for the role Rude costumers Rude managers A lot of physical labor
Rude customers Understaffed at times Hard to grow unless you bother your manager a lot
It was understaffed. Management didnt always agree with each other
some management wasn’t very good
Too many managers , talking about communication when they communicate among themselves, make you overwork yourself
Managers does not help or assist you with nothing majority of the time.
-SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED, you are expected to work like you are three people because often there are not enough employees...I don't think they realize that this just leads to more stress, callouts, and attitude -Wage should be higher...not only because you're doing the work of multiple people, but even when there are a decent amount of coworkers there, the store is ALWAYS busy at specific locations -Employee discount should be higher -Fitting room should be bigger to accommodate the high traffic of customers -More registers or self check out available

On your feet 24/7, so if that is a problem for you - you should reconsider
not the best workplace among retailers
You do to much for the role Rude costumers Rude managers A lot of physical labor
They overwork you and underpay. Takes advantage of younger employees
The team environment at my prior location felt like high school , and some of the adults didn’t respect everyone as equals ESPECIALLY if they’re given a higher position.
I let can be very competitive
Stores are understaffed and staff is overworked!
It is hard to move up in the company
Literally everything else, horrid managment
The whole company management is a very big turn off.
There was no cons for me at this job
Messy store but fun always
Sales were super crazy and hectic and there was a lot to do manually.

Great supervisors and lots of encouragement. Fun place to work!
Plenty of hours Tips Easy to advance Half off food.
Work is easy enough, but requires some thought and effort. Good for young people with driven attitudes and good work ethic. That can easily be taken advantage of. Do NOT be afraid to ask for a raise when you know you are performing better than your coworkers!!
It had good money when working there
I got very good tips
You grow a strong bond with your crew, as you are all in the trenches together. This is a great first job for teens. You learn how to work at a fast-paced environment, multitasking and customer service skills, quality control, and many more! Great tips as well (;
The tips are good and sometimes you get lucky with having good coworkers.
I don't know any, dude
The franchise I work for has a good GM and assistant managers, if not for that I'm not sure how I would feel about it.

Team was helpful for someone who was completely new to the job.
Free meal if you work 8 hours, some good people to work with, if the GM actually sees that you are working well for way too long he’ll mention to you about a raise
Typical teen job, provided good experience for learning customer service and quick thinking, problem solving etc. -fairly easy career growth. -Fairly easy to decide preferred shift times and manager working with your schedules.

I loved working in the air conditioning
flexible for school and for those with limited schedules
Fun to work with fast paced environment
its not a hard job
Wonderful working environment love it
You get tips plus minimum wage
","Nothing I can complain about
Managing labor can be exhausting(Proper training is essential, which Sonic helps tremendously here too), a great manager is worth their weight in gold. For true profitability need multiple units. Food markets can go up and down, as well as external pressures can be a tailwind or headwind to consumer behavior. Consumers can sometimes be ignorant of challenges operating business(Community engagement is key here.).
The manager wanted you to lie on paperwork audit would check if equipment was not up to par, would bully the employees, would not schedule employees because she didn't like how they worked or because they were young or slow would not schedule them much for the work week maybe a day or two, in hopes they would quit instead of being laid off because she had no grounds to fire them. The manager played high school drama in the work place no professionalism at all! Also would have employees doing extremely unsanitary and health violation stuff with the cleaning soap and sanitation with foam cups that fell on the floor and reserved them to customers.
Management is usually too lax, unorganized
It was understaffed and regular for certain crew members stick work on me or other carhops to sit in the back off break and return to a different job stopping you from doing yours, sometimes being reprimanded for not helping even during rushes, when the task is not your own. Most nights majority of the crew would not receive a break. I learned our general manager was having us cut portions on certain products depending on size and if complaint came in, let the crew or kitchen take the fall.
Hard to get a raise.
Toxic environment sometimes and poor management ruined it
lack of tips, no growth, and hot outside,
Fustrating at times and company don’t show appreciation. Also open on most holidays so unable to spend time with family
A Lot of the equipment will go down quickly. Also it can become a hostile place for first time workers.
Low wages, low tips, at the time there was no option for tips with card so minimum wage almost guaranteed
Can be a tough job to do long term.
Late nights High turnover Low pay hourly Inconsistent scheduling Only seen as a number.
Good work ethic can easily be taken advantage of. Do NOT be afraid to ask for a raise when you know you are performing better than your coworkers!! Hours can suck, and tips/positions aren't always consistent
horrible management and that's the reason I left
You are on your feet all day
This is hard work. Your feet will hurt, your body will be sore, you will smell bad when you get home. It's hot in the kitchen, and sometimes more hot outside next to the vehicles. You'll want to walk out, but the knowledge of the pain you'd be inflicting upon your coworkers leads you to stay. Working too long in these conditions causes serious burn out, can confirm.
Every single higher up cares about money more than anything else. Their main concerns are always our labor percentage and then food costs and things like that. Free meal for the employees? No because that would cost them money. They constantly want us to run short staffed so they can profit more but do absolutely nothing for the employees. They sometimes try to do competitions between stores for things like who can have the best labor percentage or best times and what do they give us in return? Literal pizza parties or maybe $200 for the store to decide what to do amongst their 30 employees.
People do a lot of talking, but not a lot of doing. Management will communicate with you via text, and fire you that way
No one gets paid enough.
Sonic was only a hard place to work when customers would complain simply because it wasn't always possible to fix their orders in the way they wanted.
It is ran on barebones to maximize profit
Low wages, low tips, at the time there was no option for tips with card so minimum wage almost guaranteed
Uniform sucks and it was really hot in the dummer
Late nights High turnover Low pay hourly Inconsistent scheduling Only seen as a number.
Alot of young kids trying to be boss
horrible management and that's the reason I left
It's a fast food job.
Dealing with assistant managers that didn’t really care
Management changing all the time, made it difficult to have stability. Labor percentages were never consistent.
As time was drawing closer to it being bought out, the culture got very hard to work under. Co-workers were leaving by choice and by design towards the end. It was upsetting to walk into the office everyday not knowing what was new or what new lie was going down the pipe.
Working outside in cold and hot weather
Wish there was more food options on the menu
Sometimes I have to take all headsets
Sonic was only a hard place to work when customers would complain simply because it wasn't always possible to fix their orders in the way they wanted.
unorganized chaotic bad training skills
It is ran on barebones to maximize profit
Cheap numbers minded lack of support
they don't pay carhops as much as they should
Uniform sucks and it was really hot in the dummer
Bad staff members at so i
Very old style type of business
They only paid $3.50 an hour for carhops because of tips and I was told it was a full time position but they only scheduled me a few hours each week
No team work and under staffed
gets boring unfulfilling no breaks on your feet whole shift

Stressful during rushes and very fast paced
Jobs are not that great
management lacks communication skills when talking to employees
Understaffed usually so you have to multitask and work quickly
The pay is pretty low starting out.
a lot of time on your feet, little to no breaks
Not letting people walk all over you
Few benefits offered, no 401 k, no sick leave, no vacation time. raises are not always given as promised..
Some of the customers was really the only negative but that is to be expected.
Long hours and low pay.
Because of too many options to order from and when they don't have enough workers it makes the order come out way too late.
no insurance or benefits, no pto, and serving outside when weather gets cold ie snow, rain, sleet, etc.
Management was not the best.
Sometimes can be under staffed
I don’t have any cons
All the rushes and people not learning in time so let's of things gets messed up and out of 25 to 30 total workers only about 8 or 9 of them are really keeping it in business
Incompetent management (!!!), understaffed, bad hourly pay, unsafe work environment, and lack of equipment needed to perform job
So much overtime for low pay
Depends on ow you feel about pay and co-workers
Low pay at the job location.
Bad staff members at so i
hot long hours in the sun
Management isn’t the strongest at most stores
Very old style type of business
The hours are long and different
They only paid $3.50 an hour for carhops because of tips and I was told it was a full time position but they only scheduled me a few hours each week
No team work and under staffed
Manager is a drunken perv who picks up women at work and comes in late and hung over.
gets boring unfulfilling no breaks on your feet whole shift
have all the equipment in working order
Skating and pants aren’t good friend woth Texas
Very Friendly , Always smile/Tell to have a nice day.
Got a bit crowded in the area where orders went out.
Will withhold your last bonus from you regardless of how you depart from the company (sometimes it’s people’s life), drama, no benefits, lack of communication between higher ups, GM, and any shift leads, favoritism, overworked for little pay, promotion/pay raises are minimal, the DM likes to get into employees personal lives and try to act like he knows what’s going on (which WILL solicit unwanted “advice”)
Customer behavior, lack of protection for employees, low pay for the effort, heat and weather from working outside, lack of recognition, bad team morale/environment (at my location) really impacts the entire shift and productivity.
Doesn’t pay well but it is amazing
I can’t think of any cons. I love place
You will be on your feet most of your shift and during the summer it can be a workout just to run food
They were terrible to work for they under pay you.
gets boring because it’s dead often
management lacks communication skills when talking to employees
Understaffed usually so you have to multitask and work quickly
The pay is pretty low starting out.
Can be stressful some days
I didn’t like working I’m the heat
lots of politics, lots of cussing
On your feet all day
the uniforms are ugly af
I don’t have any cons
Young people so can be drama

Flexible hours, company vehicle. Ok, benefits.
They offer good benefits. Not great. They could do some much more for their hardworking staff members. But if you are not on the Exec Committee, you are not important enough for them.
Enjoyed lots of time being trained on the products and services. Many times in Sales roles you are not allotted that amount of technical onboarding. As your career advances you can ask for more training if your District Manager deems it will help and will pay to fly you to corporate. Good Base salary and Car/Insurance/Gas is a huge plus.
Potential to make money if you play the game and if you don’t have a life.
Room for growth, great environment to learn, opportunity for diverse experiences, finance teams drive strategy, and overall good work/life balance

","Corporate Ladders Stink Too many cooks in the kitchen to get a simple task done Commission is capped at $250K
I spent almost 16 years here so, it wasn’t all bad. Hard work but the rewards were ok. Then they started to change things around my 10th year. Less income for the field, and more for upper management. Then they took away the incentives that drove going the extra mile for the customer. I think when Doug Baker left, so did the soul of Ecolab. Most of the guys at the top didn’t come in at the bottom.
This company only cares about their upper management's bonuses. Executive Assistants are spread thin and under paid. Your workload will be that of 3 people and it's expected. There aren't enough assistants to back you up for vacation. You have to be glued to your email and respond while you are out on your time off. It is an unspoken expectation. They say hybrid work, but the CEO is pushing for full time onsite workers and is serious about it. Make sure you push for a comfortable salary during your offer phase before coming onboard. EA's often do not get more than the 3% every other year or for a salary raise if that. Upper management gets hefty bonuses. Upper management EA's DO NOT. But you do get that OT for the 60-hour weeks. So, there is that.
You constantly are feeling the crunch of the administrative side of things by having to document each step of your sales processes so upper management can track your work. The amount of work spent selling isn't translated into that high of commision dollars, ""the selling"" IS your job and you need to do it in order to keep your job.
They’ll attempt to sweep your personal life under the rug and ask when you can work next. They’re understaffed with a high turnover rate. They’re squeezing fresh employees with hopes of ignorance. Quick to get you in the door and even faster to over load you with someone else’s work or work that has been pass due in hopes of bumping their annual bonuses by small margins. Mismanagement, low moral during any meetings, poor instruction, belittlement of employees. You’ll likely never have a weekend off as they allow call backs(must be responded to in 24hrs, yes on your day off and are extremely likely) to jobs for moronic reasonings(most occurred example: pest witnessed outside) that are not outlined in proper call back procedures for fear of losing the customer. They charge customers monthly without proper monthly inspections and do not drop clients even while understaffed(I witnessed these while conducting routine services on equipment that had gone uninspected for well over a year).
Pay trends low compared to industry averages at analyst and manager levels. Management can be slow to promote. No bonus pay for analysts. Stiff corporate culture where it is sometimes difficult to push back against management and freely express yourself. A ""yes man"" culture exists.
The vacation roll over policy has been removed so you use up all your time. This causes issues in people losing out on their earns vacation time or all has to be used at the end of the year causing short staffing issues and coverage troubles.
They expect reps to perform a huge number of related tasks that are not in the job description, and often get in the way of completing real, profitable work. Corporate red-tape is a nightmare.
Getting too much corporate bull crap. Adding meaningless work and things to do for no reason. All a numbers game and just a what have you done for me lately company. You can do great one month but the next month it’s “ yeah that was last month what have you don’t this month”. You’re just a number not a person. And hours can be crazy with being on call all the time
They have the habit of making people managers that aren't fit to be managers

Area manager cannot be trusted. They could care less about employees and turnover. Turnover rate is extremely high. The pay for what you do and deal with is a joke. They will find reasons to get rid of peoples so they can rehire for the same position but for less HOURLY PAY. The bonus inventive for sales is horrible and most of true goals for the year and impossible to reach
Corporate drama and large intitivies.
non-agile company culture, difficult to grow career, and no accountability
High stress and constant pressure. Hard to have life work balance. Long work weeks
Pay isn’t great can’t get promoted.
none I could think of
Pay is not great, don't expect to be clearing $140,000/year even with great sales numbers. Yearly ""merit increases"" are always pegged to be less than inflation, so you will consistently see your real salary drop without regular title changes. Work in the field is advertised as a sales role, but a lot of your time will be dedicated to servicing and upkeeping existing customers. Work life balance is not awful, but certainly favors the work end - particularly if you want to be recognized for promotions.
Customers sometimes don’t do what’s needed to complete job
You must be part of the in crowd the further you move along
No pay increase or ability to earn commission on sales with lots of time away from home in order to service a large geographical territory
they are ruthless when it comes to layoff. all that midwest friendliness is gone in a jiffy.
nothing bad to said about it.
Working with chemicals, over worked
Higher drive time makes your dollar per hour wage go down Inconsistent hours On call Vacation/leave is use or loose
Low Pay and benefits Top heavy, too much management Unnecessary paperwork Too corporate
Corporate usa, many meetings, no major cons
Area manager cannot be trusted. They could care less about employees and turnover. Turnover rate is extremely high. The pay for what you do and deal with is a joke. They will find reasons to get rid of peoples so they can rehire for the same position but for less HOURLY PAY. The bonus inventive for sales is horrible and most of true goals for the year and impossible to reach
Work life balance for the plant suffers more often than not
below average pay per year & no bonus for individual contributor
Many hours of driving required.
non-agile company culture, difficult to grow career, and no accountability
High stress and constant pressure. Hard to have life work balance. Long work weeks
Difficult to expand past typical field rep role and go into other industries. Not a whole lot of development available to move to other positions outside of the field rep and you can feel pigeonholed into staying in manufacturing.
Keep changing the pay plans
Low pay compared to field
Sometimes given task to do from corporate that made no sense.
Overworked with little time with family

Beginning of 2021 was told we are separating service and sales. Here in 2023 that is slowly being eroded and have constant sales pressure as someone that took a service role as I’m sure numbers are down. On call 24/7 is pretty much a cause of constant turnover and leveling veteran reps being constantly asked to run 2 territories which leads to more burnout. Upper management capped earnings for the field which has led to everybody in the field not really caring or putting for much effort or not my job attitudes. When I was hired I was told this was a career, which I believed when I started. One institutional has turned it into a a job…A terrible one.
Ecolab runs a skeleton crew and does not invest in the infrastructure needed to perform work tasks—lots of ingrained bureaucratic nonsense. Managers do not challenge the status quo and hold unrealistic expectations. There is no training structure, new hires are just thrown to the fire. Bonuses are all or nothing based on corporate metrics. It has been hard to hit the targets for some business segments. The company has furloughed the entire workforce before to meet wallstreet metrics.
Upper management does not have a clue how to lead a company
long promotion period you have to wait 2 years if not more lower than market range pay work life balance is dependent on the team you work for people are quick to throw others under to save themselves

HR is too involved with the decision process on promotions and merit increases. If you are in a field role you don't speak with HR and will likely never meet them. This said they decide if you deserve promotion, a raise and how much. Where is there logic here? The only logic would be Ecolab now exist to cater to shareholders. Due to this the customers and employees are placed on the back burner. Inflation is a real tangible thing. A substantial raise for a high performing Territory Representative is not a real thing. The recent ""one institutional"" change has all but destroyed the field's comradery. The compensation for the TR role does not match up with the required skills to perform our jobs effectively. A TR's daily routine can consist of but is not limited to the following actions and skills: making plumbing repairs, diagnosing and resolving electrical issues, replacing pump motors, moving 800lb dish machines, titrating chemistry, consulting customers, proposing new solutions, route management, weekly/monthly online training, staying caught up with emails, performing emergency service calls, maintaining communication with coworkers, scheduling installations, performing installations, parts ordering, parts inventories, bill collecting, invoice crediting, sampling of new products, conducting surveys, completing corporate account rollouts, attending safety meetings, attending district meetings, writing service reports, maintaining a company vehicle, submitting expense reports, training coworkers, covering for coworkers on leave, ordering safety supplies, trips to hardware stores for supplies, placing returns for leased equipment, managing idle equipment, diagnosing and resolving results issues, commercial laundry specialist, commercial pool boy, inventorying/placing orders for customer's, food safety specialist, knowledge on 10+ Ecolab phone applications, ware washing expert, floorcare/facilities janitorial consultant. The sad thing is you can just keep going and going. The list does not stop. There is no end to the responsibilities of a TR. If you are hard working, enjoy a challenge but don't care how you are compensated boy does Ecolab have the job for you. Very tough work life balance. You can survive and do OKAY if you work 50 hours a week or less. This said at 50 hours a week or less you will not reach each analytical number that your job performance is measured by. If you are highly motivated and truly want to excel , grow your business, study all aspects of the job so that your can perform your work function properly AND stay competitive with other high performers to seek advancement you will need to commit 70+ hours a week regularly. This will be how you reach sales budgets, make 150+ service calls a month to obtain 100% call coverage, stay on top of idle equipment, keep up with emails, and retain your customer base. Don't forget about taking care of that entire other Territory your former coworker left behind for you to caretake because they already had enough of the shenanigans. While you receive constant ESR's for the open route you will receive some benefits. Your district manager will be more forgiving and allow you to work more hours. Congrats! Great! You've performed well and provided consistent 30% plus growth in your Book of Business two years in a row that relates to 800k of gains while juggling all of the other aspects of the job. Job well done. Now let's rely that HR and or management will sift through your achievements via a video call to decide if your worthy of a $1.25/hr raise. Okay, we decided you get the raise. Here have a $1.25 an hour. But wait this wont be reflected until sometime randomly 5 months from now. We can't say exactly when. But it will happen! 5 months later and what do you get? $1 dollar an hour, we skimped you on that $.25 an hour. Why? Who knows, nobody knows what the hell is going on anymore.

Perennially short-staffed and comically high expectations (mainly due to always being under-staffed) You will never have enough resources or training to do the job properly. Upper management knows this and continues to pile it on. Company's sole focus is creating shareholder wealth by constantly taking on new business no matter how ill prepared they are to handle additional business, and it will be at the expense of their employees' work/life balance. (which is why people move around within Ecolab quite a bit. Turn and burn mentality, but at least the opportunities to move up are always there due to this) Being completely remote, forget creating any sort of relationships with your co-workers. I met the others in my district twice in 2 years. The equipment you will be expected to manage can be burdensome if you live in an apartment or do not have exterior storage. Pay is subpar in major metropolitan areas and you will not receive a meaningful raise (hence the higher turnover). If you live in a more rural area with a low cost of living, this job could work for you for a longer period. (You'll start around $20 an hour while expected to be a food safety expert, while the non-expert part-timers at the locations you're visiting are probably making close to what you're making). Overall, I don't regret my time in this position as I learned quite a bit about the industry, but I would have to be pretty hard up to do it again.
Low pay compared to field
Not focused on safety, a lot of overtime and some lapses in communication that can be dangerous or costly
Not as open to WFH as they were during the pandemic, but will do hybrid Very large company and it can be difficult to find resources due to it's size
Unrealistic expectations and poor pay
Leadership left a lot to be desired
Home office in St. Paul has entirely too much control over local a lot of things and that causes much frustration for the operations department. Getting raises sufficient to keep up with inflation over the past few years has been nigh on impossible. Accountability for performance related issues is spotty at best.
Sometimes given task to do from corporate that made no sense.
-restructure changed the field with rollout of One Institutional. It was Ecolab’s way of natural attricion through the hardships of CoVid on hospitality. Lost thousands of years of service and some of their best service techs and leaders
Current leadership has never worked in the field. They seem to have little understanding of what the day to day is actually like. Sometimes the job expectations dont align with compensation. Constant change in company structure. Entry level jobs pay structure NOT in line with requirements and needed abilities
No cons that I could think of

Only get one break for the whole day that is all not much of anything bad about the company I have always loved my job n miss it n all the great people I worked with as well. Hopefully I can go back

There not much cons what you make of it.
Large company. Politics a factor to climb the corporate ladder
Not focused on safety, a lot of overtime and some lapses in communication that can be dangerous or costly
Historical documentation retention ineffective... email.
Unrealistic expectations and poor pay
Same as all large companies. No real road to advancing. Most positions are dead-ends. Not competitive in wages.
Very low female to male ratio Politics can get in the way
Tough to move up at company
Stressful, unclear, lack of support, politics and the people don't really care about you, they will give you unrealistic situations and set you up to fail and blame you for failing which is toxic and damaging.
in transition and working through issues
No work life balance at all, terrible training
Not enough agents to take call.

It was my first job. I went through 3 different owners at my location, so it made it a bit hectic at times because of all the changes that came with that. It's definitely a good first job. Since I'm rather shy, I noticed I became more social and my communication skills improved. I got better at handling tasks and a bit of managing. I would have become a trainer if I didn't go off to college. They also have good flexible hours, so that was also really nice.
Love the company and most of the people I work with. Our regulars are wonderful and it’s so nice to see all the time. Most days I enjoy the job.

One of the greatest things about my store I work at is the family atmosphere that is created amongst the team. CFA is always busy so if you are prepared to work hard and challenge yourself, you won’t have to worry about being let go during slow seasons.

I enjoyed my time at CFA, and I was able to gain $10K in scholarships for college. This enabled me to pursue an engineering degree while working part time at CFA.

Some of the best/nicest/fun people to work with. The work you do is almost always going to keep you busy/entertained if that is something you are looking for.

This specific location allowed you to customize your hours and shifts on a website very flexible and easy. The whole crew of team members when I worked there were very kind. Adjusting to the team is easy because other team members will explain and guide you through things.
The atmosphere is really good The staff is usually really sweet
Positive work environment: Many employees report that Chick-fil-A has a very positive work culture that emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Managers are often supportive and willing to help their employees. Flexible scheduling: Chick-fil-A restaurants are typically open seven days a week, which means there are plenty of opportunities for flexible scheduling. Many employees appreciate the ability to choose their shifts and work around their other commitments. Opportunities for advancement: Chick-fil-A is known for promoting from within and providing opportunities for career growth. Employees who demonstrate a strong work ethic and positive attitude are often given opportunities to move up to higher-level positions.
Good pay Friendly management Flexible scheduling
honestly, not many pros. maybe the fact that if you stick around long enough, they might offer you marketing team opportunities but honestly even those were underpaid
Discounted food. Good people, funish environment
Fast paced, guaranteed hours, always off on Sunday, higher expectations from guests and fellow workers
","none that I can think of
Limited hours of operation: Chick-fil-A is known for being closed on Sundays, which is a part of their company-wide policy. While this closure aligns with their values and allows employees a day off, it may also limit the number of working hours available compared to establishments that operate seven days a week. This can be a disadvantage for individuals seeking full-time employment or those who rely on consistent work hours. Fast-paced and demanding environment: Chick-fil-A is popular and often experiences high customer volumes, especially during peak times. This can create a fast-paced and demanding work environment that requires employees to work efficiently under pressure. It may not be suitable for individuals who prefer a slower-paced or more relaxed work atmosphere.
During rushes, it can be very stressful. My location didn't have any cover for when we were outside order taking so I got really sunburned during the summer. Summer and Winters are the worst for order taking. Managers can sometimes get on a power trip and be really harsh, which has made some team members cry, but I've never personally gone through that.
But we changed Operators a couple of years ago, new Operator brought his old team with him, and don’t feel as valued with I did with old Operator. Pay is not consistent-some team members are paid less than they should be based on their time with the restaurant and their position and how hard they work and meanwhile, new team members are being paid higher and doing less. There is a lot of favoritism towards the team from Operator’s old restaurant as well as certain other employees. Part-time people have an hard time getting hours because all hours are given to full-timers. And they keep hiring more people so people are always begging for hours. Also, since COVID, I feel we stopped a lot of the little things that made Chick-fil-A stand out from the other fast food restaurants in our area.
Unless you were close to the management (at least in this location) there were no opportunities for grow. Most people in the higher positions don't do their job and expect the rest to handle everything. And customers in the area can be quite rude and complicated Also, I don't recommend it if you're not Christian. Employees and customers can be pushy about their beliefs
rude management; not allowed to receive tips; I was told I would receive a raise after the 3 month evaluation, but I did not receive a raise until working there for 5 months.
they work you like crazy if you don't set boundaries from the beginning and they do not care that you are 16. depending on team leads and managers it can be hell to work there. depending on the store if you are black, you may be uncomfortable, TONS of microaggressions
Not necessarily a con, but if you do not work well in fast paced environments ^ would recommend working a shift without a dinner or lunch rush
With family comes drama at times. However, things usually work themselves out. The fast paced environment can tend to be a bit much for some.
From discrimination to nepotism, favoritism, and double standards, the directors at this particular store are completely incompetent. I have never worked for anyone who is so horrible at being a business owner that they will literally tell an employee to their face that he doesn't care about their well-being or care if they are short-staffed. Apparently, it's not what you know about business, but who you know that gets you a Chick Fil A restaurant of your own. Pay is not commensurate to the workload, and if you kiss their you know what you might get a pay increase or promotion but it is not retro active to when you get it, it's whenever the incompetent HR (sister of owner) gets around to doing it.
Very fast-paced, not good communication.
Leadership was terrible, the appointed leaders were to lazy to lead and would rather dump their tasks onto the those bellow them, many of them setting rules they themselves never followed. The Equipment in both the front of house and back of house is terrible and is only replaced when it is completely broken, so chances of getting hurt from these terrible pieces of equipment were in the 70-80 percentiles. You weren't allowed to socialize with other people even when work was slow, because there was always something that ""needed"" to be done.
Management sucked and was very picky at the one I worked at
not enough money to pay per employee
Difficult to deal with mean customers.
Stressful at times and some of the managers were not the best
Shaky leadership structure Rushed training Delayed of follow-through
Over worked and no tips
Stressful, fast pace, occasional toxic environment, favoritism, not much room for growth
Extremely controlling. Never ever want feedback from employees on how or what managers could do better or where communication is lacking. It is a sit down ( except your not because it's customer service ) and shut up job. I've never seen a management tier that cared so very little for their employees than this location. Many of my coworkers said the best thing you can do is get out as fast as possible. One manager was so cruel I cried. I don't cry especially in the face of a tyrant. Another was violating company policy by explaining how I was doing company policy but it just wasn't good enough for them and I needed to reconsider my choice in working for them. I'll never recommend them to anyone. I had a manager that even when a customer would pay more to get extra items on their food they would refuse. I had a manager who promised more hours and more pay if I decided to leave my other job. I left the job. Never got a raise never got increased hours. It was an act of God but I'm not there anymore and I have more peace.
- can get stuck in the same position for a long time - negative environment every once in a while
The pay is minimal no matter how much experience you have. The customers are awful.
Potential growth with leadership development
They lied and promised me 60k but then gave me slow time where I had to work 52 hours a week to make the salary promised Not enough actual sales and marketing experience Job description was exaggerated (they lied) Stifle your growth Have to fight hard not to be just a glorified shake maker
They don't pay you enough for the level of service they expect you to give
Always try to give one-week advance notice of scheduling; two weeks is better.
None really in my experience.
sometimes the weather be bad
- If you are front of house, you will be outside. If you are outside, prepare to be hot. There have been days where I've spent hours outside in 95+ degree heat.
Working outside, a fast-paced, often stressful environment,
Other people on the road

Rush for breakfast lunch and dinner are very busy.
Still work ya know my dude
I worked at 3 different locations across the US. This included Missouri, Florida, and Pennsylvania. By far the biggest con of working at any of these stores was the leadership. Don't get me wrong, most of the locations most of the time had great leaders, but there were waves of leadership that preferred to place blame on others and take credit for thenselves. However, this can be found at any place of work, and it was usually during rough patches where recruitment and retention was low.
Got stressful and burnout was common
Very fast-paced, not good communication.
- training is for all Chick-fil-A's so it includes a lot of information that's unnecessary to our location since ours is a miniature version with a limited menu, meaning the training is unnecessarily long and you have to read through a lot of information that you'll never need to know since our location doesn't do any of it

The Equipment in both the front of house and back of house is terrible and is only replaced when it is completely broken, so chances of getting hurt from these terrible pieces of equipment were in the 70-80 percentiles. You weren't allowed to socialize with other people even when work was slow, because there was always something that ""needed"" to be done.
Hard, hard work, it's a fast food restaurant at the end of the day
- long hours - no holiday pay - stressful
Might become stale throughout the day to day work
Stressful at times and some of the managers were not the best
Hard to move upward High expectations for team members
Not having enough workers that want to work
Sometimes it can get hot in the kitchen. Cleaning isn't fun but part of the job.
Long hours, busy, limited breaks
Over worked and no tips
Extremely controlling. Never ever want feedback from employees on how or what managers could do better or where communication is lacking. It is a sit down ( except your not because it's customer service ) and shut up job. I've never seen a management tier that cared so very little for their employees than this location. Many of my coworkers said the best thing you can do is get out as fast as possible. One manager was so cruel I cried. I don't cry especially in the face of a tyrant. Another was violating company policy by explaining how I was doing company policy but it just wasn't good enough for them and I needed to reconsider my choice in working for them. I'll never recommend them to anyone. I had a manager that even when a customer would pay more to get extra items on their food they would refuse. I had a manager who promised more hours and more pay if I decided to leave my other job. I left the job. Never got a raise never got increased hours. It was an act of God but I'm not there anymore and I have more peace.
The pay is minimal no matter how much experience you have. The customers are awful.
Got stressful and burnout was common
Having to go outside to take orders on iPAD, it can suck on a hot or rainy day.

It’s a 24/6 job (closed on Sunday). Don’t promote to management if you are trying to also earn a degree.
Management is inconsistent and often rewards those who talk over those who work hard.
There is barely any cons
Although I learned a lot at this job, it became too much as a full-time college student. As a team member or assistant team lead, your life is great. You will typically follow directions and stay in one to two positions at a time. Your leaders support you and are not depended on or given too much responsibility. As you climb the leadership ladder, you are handed more responsibility and pressure, which grows as they trust you. You must be able to multi-task very well. Because, at times, you will be juggling leading a shift, team member drama, guest complications, money tasks, and task lists, among other things, all at once. The pressure and responsibility became too much as I pursued a nursing degree. I do not regret working for Chick-fil-A, as they and their customer service values helped to shape who I am today.
Low pay Stressful, busy days Strict behavior
Long hours and had to deal with some unhappy customers at times
Some leaders are power hungry Hectic in rushes
Pay, Late Nights, Mildly disorganized
Food service. Intense and rapid pace.
will work you like a dog long shifts, can't sit at any time except breaks and while in the restroom have to ask to use the restroom
Long hours. Slow growth. Fully expect to keep the Chick-fil-A face on at all times. No room for honest emotion
Nothing. Great place to work
Each owner is different and I had a bad owner opperating the store
Low wages, same work positions even if you ask to try something new, hard to move up in leadership, closing sucks, leadership can go “overboard” when it comes to certain company rules, too strict, most rules are a waste of time (both workers and guests have admitted that they make no sense), leadership religiously promotes, defends & enforce these same useless (makes everyone’s job harder) type rules.
Stressful at times when there is a lot going on at once
None I can’t see anything
Standing in the same spot all day
Constantly busy from before opening to after closing. If you are interested in a job where you can be more relaxed or not stressed out for the majority of the hours that you are working then this may not be the place for you. Customers can also be very pretentious and can act as if they deserve everything, which can be quite difficult to deal with depending on the day. For the amount of work you are doing and the amount of time and hustle you are giving, the pay could be a little higher, but it is by no means bad pay.
Sometimes it can be very stressful
can be harder physically, standing long hours, running around stocking etc, customers suck
The only downsides are the pay and sometimes hours.
Managers are horrible to their employees and will write you up over the smallest detail! ( for example,I was written up for wearing blue socks!) (and fired for washing my hands with cold water ON MY BREAK!!) I worked here during the pandemic when we were doing 3 lanes and all employees who were not Management or Shift leads were forced outside the entire day aside from your 30 minute break. No matter if it was Pouring rain,freezing outside and you were already sick with a cold,or getting sunburnt to the point that for a month after I was fired I still had sun damage on my arms and chest.
Poor pay and benefits. Management sucks, always understaffed, lazy coworkers.
Working outside. Toxic lower management. Favoritism. No growth opportunities.

Upper management was strict and had terrible communication and caused a lot of confusion at times.
Can become very chaotic and fast pace when it's busy. Not the best hourly wage when I worked there.
Customers can be rude sometimes I was not a fan of the managers
Fast-paced work environment: Working at Chick-fil-A can be very fast-paced and demanding. During peak hours, employees may be required to work quickly and efficiently to keep up with demand. Limited menu: Some employees report that the limited menu at Chick-fil-A can be frustrating, especially if they are working in the kitchen and doing the same tasks repeatedly. High standards: Chick-fil-A has very high standards for its food quality and customer service, which can be challenging for some employees to maintain consistently.
Very fast paced and busy
honestly so many cons. they treat you like crap, i started at 8.25/hour, was one of their top employees and yet still only earned 10.50 when i left 3 years later (raises were about $.25 each). also the managers were like a clique— supporting/shielding the toxic ones (and the sexual harassers too)! honestly, the worst place i have ever worked!!
Hard work. Long hours and angry guests
no PTO even at manager level, terrible benefits offered, working on holidays/late hours

Good vacation and benefits package
The Penn State Applied Research Lab offers a unique environment for those interested in both applied research and test and evaluation work. Some managers and teams are exemplary and contribute positively to the lab's mission.
I could work remotely, and I didn't have to be clocked in at a certain time. I got the work done when I could. It was really nice.
Great coworkers, benefits, and atmosphere.
I was a student employee at Penn State and it was a good job for what it was; provided me with good experience.

The leadership in every department I interacted with was amazing. I truly felt like I was a part of a team.

The university has great infrastructure and support for research operations.

","Pay is on the lower side, but it wasn’t the end of the world.
I don't think there are many opportunities for further professional development and promotion.
low pay, revolving door, no incentive to stay
Nature of Work: Although the lab is positioned as an applied research entity, there is an increasing focus on 6.3 and 6.4 work, which doesn't align with the core mission of applied research. The shift towards test and evaluation tasks might be a concern for those primarily interested in research. Faculty Treatment: The treatment of faculty can be inconsistent. There's a lack of support in terms of startup funds and mentorship, which can make the career progression of new assistant professors challenging. This has led to a decline in the number of faculty members over the last decade. Office Space: Office accommodations vary widely, often leaving senior staff in less desirable spaces. Despite management's claims that the issue is widespread, some new hires receive newly renovated, air-conditioned offices. More equitable distribution of office space would benefit all. Career Progression: Mid-career growth opportunities are limited, often requiring one to take on substantial projects or manage a department to advance. This bottleneck has led to a noticeable gap in the workforce between mid-career and near-retirement professionals. Leadership Vision: While some managers are forward-thinking, others seem to lack a clear vision for their departments' future. A more strategic approach, rather than one solely driven by funding, would benefit the long-term growth and direction of the lab.
None! It was a great experience.

1. You're NOT getting a raise unless you move to a different position in the university so don't get too comfortable 2. University goes on about how much they care about diversity, but it's just talk 3. Spineless supervisors that are powerless against central HR
- Pay & Compensation - Leadership - No affinity groups for BIPOC staff
HR protects managers who show bias Inconsistent work hours Uncertainty in job stability
Location is in a somewhat remote town.
I greatly enjoyed my first two decades as an employee. The last four years have been miserable. While there has always been some 'dead weight' which could be trimmed, it has gotten MUCH worse since COVID. A sizeable portion of the workforce barely completes the minimum requirements for their position. Those who work from home are likely not working--just checking emails twice a day and are instead out working in their garden, babysitting their grandkids, or working another part-time job. This is true from admins to upper middle management. And yet staff still complain there is no work/life balance. If some would work any less, they'd actually just have a hobby. Those of us who actually take our jobs seriously and give 100% get zero recognition for it...or are told by our coworkers or supervisor we are doing too much. HR is absolutely WORTHLESS...unless you lean Left or are a protected class and claim you are being discriminated against/harassed. They will jump all over that. If you lean Right or are not a protected class and take issues to them, they will sit on it for months, or will tell you to suck it up or move on with your life. There is currently ZERO equity (a word they love to throw around) in salaries. There are new hires coming into my department with 15 fewer years of experience making the same or more than I make after 20+ years here. I thrived in my first position and looked forward to every day I worked as part of an amazing team lead by someone who actually had a spine and was willing to stand up for what she believed in. That leader moved on, and within months I was forced out of that position (see my notes about HR above, and the University's 'zero tolerance' policy is a joke) and had two more good years as part of a new team. As noted, things have really gone downhill since 2020. I would no longer recommend the University as a career to anyone, and I am counting down the days until I can retire.
Change of rules almost every year
The job can have some long hours with being on-call.
Overworked, underpaid, because you are getting experience from various areas, you have no support as you are the support. You do not get trained properly and when hired are given everything the last assistant has done and they expect you to just pick it up with minimum to no errors.
Student health and care not given importance. They'd rather kick you out than try to help you if you're struggling

Change of rules almost every year
workflow varies No room for moving up because it's one position
Not to bad of a time
could increase the diversity in research
I don’t have any cons as of right now
The compensation standards for research professor are insulting. The starting salary is a little more than a postdoc and way below that of a tenure track professor - regardless if you are managing people or bringing in tons of grants. The strict HR guidelines for compensation means that it's not possible to get a better compensation - and its based on State College standard of living even if there is a remote position that has a higher cost of living. They explicitly do not compete with industry compensation which is why they lose a lot of good people.
There is no cons for this
sometimes negative coworkers, many things to learn to work efficiently
Very toxic and intimidating management
It can get pretty crazy near finals
Winters can be a little harsh.
Financial crisis with higher education and specifically throughout the Penn State system lead to unstable job outlook and longevity.
Monotony of doing daily meaningless tasks
Nothing bad. I am pretty good here.
The administration does not value the College's professors. Discrimination is rampant. Horrible climate for anyone who is not white, not straight/gender-conforming, not married, and not a parent. That said, women who are parents are also often put in a lose-lose position.
Always try to provide the minimum salary
Pay is low! Parking on campus is expensive.

very political, very hard to move up, stagnant wages, low wages, lots of nepotism
The work can be boring
Its is a bit isolated from any major city
The changing financial model makes it tough
Sometimes the classes can be overwhelming
Opportunities are shoved on preselected people, favouritism exists.
Cost of living expenses could be improved
Penn State used to pay it's employees above average wages but it has fallen way behind national averages and inflation. Yearly cost of living increases that actually reflect inflation instead 1.5-2% and at this point needs to raise wages by at least 15% to make up for all the years they've lagged behind.
Senior leadership is disconnected, self serving, and treats people awfully
Just okay sometimes for the most part
- A lot of budget issues here, could spell for job stability issues later on
Pay leaves a lot to be desired, not much room for advancement unless you want to be a manager….
not great pay sometimes stuck doing tedious things
They should consider sponsoring international students. Giving better remuneration to employees.
Managers/supervisors cannot think outside the box. Don’t know how to teach and expect your coworkers to do their training.
Could be more pay but it’s still okay
non,, the job is pretty easy and you work on your own time
- lower than average salary - no flexible work arrangements for those who travel
Need more communication from the top.
The organization has invested in changing their model to make things move more quickly. Yet, that means more admin positions without direct support for research. The organization suffers as an academic stop over and individuals not invested in development.
Remote Working is a hassle
Many classrooms are too hot, had wasps in my class for most of the semester
Poor raises, expenses keep climbing with no or small raises.
no overtime and can be chaotic at times
Very nice people work here
Staffing is bad just like everywhere
Not many benefits offered to students
No room for improvement at all, very political Low pay
As responsibilities increase pay remains the same. Also the cost of living “raises” provided are not guaranteed and are almost always below inflation rates, meaning you are taking a pay cut ever single year.
the salary is a bit low but above minimum.
Small city may not be good for everyone
Over enrollment, overworked, underpaid employees
only work up to 24 hours
No cons, great place to work
Nothing much to say on that as it was nice overall.
The salary should be improved
Salaries do not adjust to the country's current financial situation.
Teaching assistant positions are often semester-based, meaning that there is no guarantee of continued employment after each semester ends.
Pay could be slightly higher
low pay and location and tenure
Could be more pay but it’s still okay
non,, the job is pretty easy and you work on your own time
Better organization would help the workers.
- lower than average salary - no flexible work arrangements for those who travel
Pay is less compared to market rates. Not many opportunities for growth internally in the academic departments, especially in the College of Medicine. You need to wait for someone to leave or retire in order to move up. Cannot move between Penn State Health and Penn State College of Medicine without starting over and losing PTO Bank and service years.
Need more communication from the top.
Very disorganized, there is no communication between departments. They lost my paperwork a couple of times which resulted in me not getting payed for two months. They made up for it later but it was a struggle for someone who does not earn much money to begin with
no overtime and can be chaotic at times
Racist and their VALUES are not actually real. They will fire you for speaking up against bigotry.

none what so ever, they don't even give you a bereavement policy for when family dies. I should know I had to bury my parents due to a homicide case a month ago and got told ""we don't have a policy for that just use your sick days"" since they don't even give you paid time off.
For the first hour of rush hour they can do it fine
It was a 15 minute walk. Had some good coworkers.
Experience and literally nothing else
I can only speak on my experience at my location which is a franchise and not corporate. I really enjoy it of course there can be times and people that can make it annoying at times but what job doesn't. Our locations Management is great they are flexible and understanding of real life issues and situations. Of course responsibility on your part is required dont expect to not call if going to be late. Easy to work for can work as much as you want , overtime no problem as long as you work.
Good tips. Cash money payment
Good working environment. Good people to work with.
For the most part, everyone I've worked with was pretty friendly and easy to work with. Some days are also really good with how much tips you can get.
Don’t have to really work
","gets repetitive very very quickly
The pay for a delivery driver is low
Meeting new scary people at their homes.
- Wear, tear and extra mileage on your personal vehicle. You must be comfortable with this or it is not for you. - If you wish to sit around, play on your phone alot, and not be a team mate, stay busy, jump in and help where there is need, you will not make it. Everyone who works here does their part and is a great team member.
Mornings can be a hit or miss, dinners are usually best
Always room for improvement everyday
No cons that I could think of
Wear and tear on personal vehicle.
No cons really besides showing up lol.
Long shifts, open late, hot
No cons that I could think of

No cons really besides showing up lol.
Physical, High Turnover, Demanding, Food
Long shifts, open late, hot
Lack of professionalism by management
Terrible health insurance for anyone under gm status.
The pay isn't great. Tips were sub par.
If you work hard you get rewarded by doing other people's work too, very exploitive business practices, including deducting your tips from your pay reducing your actual paycheck as if your tips are your wage, oftentimes refuse to acknowledge satisfactory or good work, oftentimes does not discipline poor work ethic or behaviors, often chastises employees who follow rules and report the bad and rule breaking coworkers. They promise PTO and holiday leave and other such things that they never actually give to employees who are not solely the general manager, regular employees don't get time off and if you dare to call out because you have a family member in the hospital they will bully in chastise you including but not limited to trying to cut your pay without your consent.
Had to show up for work
there are no cons to working here
Stressful, over demanding, fast paced
If no one's ordering you're only making the minimum amount when if there's orders you earnings go way up per hour.( Due to the tips but some people tip very badly)
The delivery car never had gas in it, I used my own car
Managers can be driven by metrics at the expense of drivers' potential income. Forcing you to take single delivery runs.
Pay/work are both not great
Horrible work scheduling , poor higher leadership
Pay could be a little better
Poor tips, a lot of wear and tear on your car, most money you get is from gas and the tips you do get will in time go toward car maintenance.
Spending so much money on gas was unfortunate but an expected part of the job
not so great ok so
Fake hiring people. Don't waste your time applying.
Pay, lots of orders with no tips in my area
they don't pay enough for mileage
Papa John's is struggling to keep up with competitors so the margins are razor thin. The GMs typically make little more than assistants so the only good reason to move up to GM is to build your resume.
Dealing with people but it's okay.
- Very fast paced environment - Poor management - Stressful - No breaks of any kind, unless there is a slow time - No room for growth
Bureaucratic issues all around the structure
Franchise management tries to pay you the least they can. We had 7 out of 9 employees leave because they felt they were underpaid during my short time there. Turnover rates are high.
I just want to see salaries
Pay/work are both not great
Minimum pay for execs and managers to line their pockets.
Pay could be a little better
But my problem are the benefits
None it’s the best environment to work in and I walk in with a smile on my face
Fake hiring people. Don't waste your time applying.
Direction of work and priorities not so clear
Slow nights not much money, topper tracks your speed
Work advancement options are not great.
Management could be better Understaffed a lot of the times
*Long work hours *Poor Corporate Support *Inconsistent Standards
Minimum pay for execs and managers to line their pockets.
Literally everything, never ever been in a properly air conditioned papa johns
Poor management, bad decision making, no people skills, not employee friendly, psychotic and high strung owner but only prefers and promotes females under 25.

Not long after I started working at PJ’s in 2019, the company’s focus shifted from quality of service and goods to quantity and speed. More and complex items were continually added to the menu, with the expectation of swift service still looming over us employees.
Management could be better Understaffed a lot of the times
I don’t have any bad reviews
Wanted more money and hours.
Use of own vehicle and pay for gas
It can be hard if you're the only driver at close as most of the cleanup falls to you.
Not great pay. Will get taken advantage of
Lies to you about how much you get paid, overworked, it’s literally 80 degrees inside the store at times
low pay, a lot expected from higher ups, promises not delivered
No one could make a decent living off of this hourly wage alone, expected to do everyone else’s job and the one time you refuse you’re labeled as a trouble worker. Most employees come in, sit down in the office and stare at their phones and when brought up to management I was told “that wasn’t his job”, well it sure wasn’t my job.
-pay isn’t great -drama can happen easily
Not much growth, pay is low, ineffective management, very fast paced
Too much change at the top levels causes more change than needed. The office is now a revolving door of low talent.
Toppings limited not enough for custom
I was forced to work despite being exposed to COVID and feeling ill or else I would be fired, the work is physically exhausting, I was chastised for taking days off for disability and when a family member was dying, and management could not care less about me.
Long hours and cleaning required.
- not enough pay, long hours
Salary - not enough compensation for the work
Low hours, poorly managed, training was all rushed.
Lots of wear and tear on the car
Low pay the whole time
Can be very busy sometimes
Hard to move up the ladder, pay raise are not good.
Burnt out employees that are overworked Not enough compensation for driving own vehicle.
Pay is highly variable based on tips, wear and tear on your car adds up over time, and it's very dependent on the specific delivery area if the tips make it worth it.
The boss made many people cry
There were a few cons overall
Low pay, employees expect you to make pizza with little to no training
inconsistent schedule, usually have to work weekends
Not enough hours for employees
Pay was just sub par, could be bumped a bit.
Almost always get bad management and the few times when there is good management they don't last long due to horrible support for managers given by the higher ups. leaving only the lesser management that only ever looks out for themselves.
They have terrible managers who have people’s with everyone for no reason.
I have seen better communication and organization
Unwashed tools, messy workplace, management hell
In my opinion and only at my location there are a-lot of younger kids can be at least for me or someone that works and puts in extra initiative annoying l. Example being we all have areas one is assigned to but doesn’t mean u cant do other things or multi task in other areas and when some of these younger ones are not busy as in have a task in there assigned station they will just jump on phone or go else where and talk and socialize instead of sweep or clean up area they have to be told and if by someone other than management they wont do it and even if sometimes they dont as well and they expect you to help them when they are working but not other way around thats my only complaint though our management does always say if your not busy clean or restock do something but you can only do so much with these kids now days thats my only con i have at my location
Sometimes you don’t make much money.
Needs more pay and better gas reimbursement.
The biggest thing though I'd say that can be done better is work hours. Mainly what I mean by that is getting off of work on time. I'm technically part time but with how much overtime I've had to do constantly it might as well be considered a full-time job.
No one else will work

The Merchandise Assistant role is a great entry level position coming out of college! As an MA, you learn so much about Merchandising/Off Price Business from the ground up. The Buyers, Supervisors, and my MA Team were very friendly and supportive. TJX is an excellent company to work for and provides top notch training, work life balance and benefits.
Co workers Free parking Flex Fridays
The workplace environment is fun, café is great and has very good food. If you apply yourself you will get extra work and opportunities (good resume builder). My boss/managers and I got along well and they appreciated the work I did. I was also able to make some great friends here. Benefits here are the best I've had, and my health insurance covered most things.
Pay is high for the area and physical impact of most departments
Benefits are nice, Summer Fridays (Everyone stops working at 1pm every Friday during the summers).
Salary is at least decent.
weekly pay and it's hourly rate everything pass 40 is over time and generous with sick time also personal pay included in your time off
Alright job very stressful standing on your feet for 12 hours everyday that’s the hardest part of it to be honest. I was doing flat ticketing which seems easy but more definitely goes into you just be fast careful and very precise
Not sure… maybe the free parking?
If you're young, lazy, disrespectful, not ""White"" and don't like to work hard this is the place for you.

They don’t send you home if there is no work
","Not always up to date with tech
Overall, I enjoyed my experience at TJX but upward mobility is limited once the MA role is mastered. Unlike many other departments, there is no linear career path/promotions for MAs beyond the MA role. If you’re looking to eventually become a Buyer or Planner, the only option is to apply through the PASE Program. From my experience, it is difficult to get selected into the program internally but not impossible. My advice is don’t give up and keep applying yourself!
Low pay Lack of transparency Favoritism - leaders don’t truly recognize talent Don’t listen to employees Good associates overworked
The extra work you receive will not equate to a higher raise. If you want to move up into planning you have to have the ""personality"" they want. Doing great at your job only gets you so far. Kissing up to higher management and being fake will get you where you want to go. If you're a hard worker and pride yourself on that instead of spending most of your time socializing, I suggest you get your experience and then look elsewhere.
Unclear policy, supervisors don't communicate
Lack of job growth for POC, every other POC on my team either did not stay long and left or the lack thereof. Did not feel like a safe work envirnonment.
The company does not care for your well being, they have a false message of its ok to take ""sick days"". They have a false value of ""collaboration"", instead everyone works on their own things because no one has time to help anyone else. Be prepared to work overtime, you are always on call and if you can't get your work done, your supposed to work until you do. Also there re ""business emergencies"" almost every week which can require 60 hours a week, so the concept of ""work-life balance"" that they pride themselves on is a complete joke. Be prepared to work with people that have immense egos, that they cannot ever be possibly wrong. So be prepared to take the brunt force of how you will be constantly in the wrong, even if you're right. I highly recommend not even bothering applying for this job, unless you want to make a few more thousand dollars than some other companies, but be completely miserable.
scheduled 46 hours weekly you always work more and the company continues to extend the hours later the company is always understaffed
Standing all day, being micromanaged by higher ups .
So many not sure where to start. The lack of education and intellect within the Advertising team was surprising. I was hardly challenged at all in the interview process and then got the job and wondered if something was really wrong there, something was. Upper management longing to be accepted by the Agency they’re using at the time, letting them run the show, running around in the clown-like outfits the stylists would dress them in, straight from the cheap clothes showcased in the underwhelming campaigns. Don’t go there if you want to learn anything or grow in your advertising career.
Management treats ""Good Workers Bad"" and ""Bad Workers Good."" Some work hard while they let others be on vacation at work!! Pay is terrible for the money all TJX Corp. stores make! $20,000.00-$42,000.00 A DAY!! Lousy 10% discount! LOL I can't even click on one Star but its making me!!
Pressure from upper management and constant changes
It is a bit challenging to get ahead and get promoted as it mostly seems that happens if you're a self promoter and your boss likes you.
Low on hours, high turnover
Not for outside hires No work life balance Team members travel, heavy work load must be maintained while traveling.
Poor management, Asking people to signup for the credit cards
* Lack of training when hired
- Low, low pay - Little direction from management
Unrealistic expectations sometimes Favoritism Low pay to work ratio
Low pay and not enough hours no matter how hard you work. They make a fortune and constantly talk about sales and how well we are doing 90% of the time yet cut us back to a minimum of staff and hours constantly. No incentive to do more or push TJX rewards cards constantly. They use to give regular gift cards to top performers but not anymore.
No Loyalty to Employees No room for growth Upper management has changed for the worse Just know that you are an at will employee - and they will fire you for no wrongdoing if it will help their bottom line
was remote for this position so was not able to meet face to face with many of my co-workers
Less security for retail market
Culture can be great but a challenge to onboard into.
They don’t order dimes, craziest thing I’ve ever heard of - LOL Holiday pay is good, except, you either use it in that week, or you lose it. You get a 6 day check, but you may or may not get the time off. During 4th qtr, don’t plan on getting the time off
Career advancement is rare Pay is not good
Frequent encounters with rude customers
Not for outside hires No work life balance Team members travel, heavy work load must be maintained while traveling.
No work-life balance Rude customers
- Mandatory overtime if you work night shift. - Stressful especially during peak season. - Might have to cover multiple departments. - A lot of administrative work.
Sometimes management can stress you out with how much they want you to push the tjx card
Mangment are so rude don’t work for them
You were just a body to fill the chair
Poor management, Asking people to signup for the credit cards

- salary slightly lacking compared to similar roles in my area
Mid-level management can be hit or miss
Tough hours, open until 10 pm
work life balance is tough sometimes
Depending on the department you are in, work varies. Some teams are severely understaffed, and some are able to do just fine with 2-3 people.
Toxic environment Management sucks Co workers are very bossy
They cut your hours down to 5-8 hours a week. Sometimes you're not on the schedule for 2 weeks. Managers are unwilling to guide or help employees when there is a problem. Then blame the employee when the problem goes unresolved. Managers make employees feel worthless and talk down to them.
Many upper management retired after Covid. New management started firing long term employees right before their 20th anniversary. Exceeded expectations of my position for 19 years and was let go of for a clerical error 1 month before my 20th anniversary that would have been more vacation - was already at 5 weeks - would have had large contracted yearly bonus increase.
For me, very large corporation
Not really any cons for me
No personal incentive for associates when customers apply for credit. Corporate compensation is $1 for every credit application submitted to be used to purchase snacks for the entire store, per month.
- salary slightly lacking compared to similar roles in my area
too many people hired and quitting, felt overworked at times
the pay isn’t too great
Tough hours, open until 10 pm
Credit card applications were tough
No growth and the pay is very low
Have to work weekends and evenings. Customers can be rude.
terrible management at this place
Toxic environment Management sucks Co workers are very bossy
the demands for credit card applications overshadows everything else; 10% employee discount is measly; pay is stagnant; ""open door policy"" is pointless because there's no communication; Store Management micromanages and overworks those who actually work but make no attempts to discipline those who don't; puts all responsibility on the CECs to run the entire store
No formal development within the company.
For me, very large corporation
Not really any cons for me
You must wait one full year to get your sick days, personal time and 2 weeks of vacation as a full time employee
They cut down hours also only add not up to a dollar every year.....That's too small for a job where you get to stand on your feet for 8hours
need to have a lot of energy for moving around.
Large company with a typical corporate environment
Endless list Manager berates her direct report (other managers) in meetings with hourly staff, meetings consist of her telling us what the svp wants and threatens to have svp join meetings if we don’t comply. Expected to work late for little to no pay. Clique and toxic work environment- senior leaders involved in toxic behaviors. You are black listed for not agreeing with senior leader. If this office was audited there would be many violations.
Staff turnover can be high for demanding work levels and challenges with competitive pay
A lot of walking that’s all
I wish there were more hours given .
No growth and the pay is very low
Sometimes I am not given enough hours for the week.
Low on associates, that’s about all the cons.
Have to work weekends and evenings. Customers can be rude.
10% discount, retail, not enough associates on the floor
terrible management at this place
lack of development plan for people who have been with the company for 2+ Years. Seems that a lot of people are pushed toward certain roles that they may not actually want to work in.
The role can be intense most of the time.
Overworked for little pay Poor management
Low pay, micromanaging , hard to move up.
Worklife balance and lack of support
Just another number and don’t help you grow
The Management team is horrible , never seen nothing like it .
horrible pay for doing management work harass you about the credit cards un consistent and rude management lazy workers i worked full time not once had any benefit beside the discount… no pto no sick time no anything
This company lures you in by telling you how much they value their employees but don’t trust it. They allow associates to curse and yell at the management, and do nothing about them but if management requires employees to do their job, they are subject to investigation and termination. They say they want their teams to be welcomed, valued and engaged and that’s the last thing they do. The treatment of their management staff is deplorable.
the pay could be better
A lot of walking that’s all
I wish there were more hours given .
Low pay, no bonuses or incentives.
The leadership shows favoritism, has no morals and doesn’t follow their own policies.
Work life balance. No opportunities for growth or advancement. Dead end job. Credit card is first priority and lots of pressure to make goals. As a manager, after going from salary to hourly, have to work longer days to make same amount of money. That’s pretty much a demotion!
Sometimes I am not given enough hours for the week.
Low on associates, that’s about all the cons.
10% discount, retail, not enough associates on the floor
Selling TJX credit cards is very important. If you are good at selling it, you can expect more pay and hours. The job is physically challenging since you have to work fast and carry heavy stuff sometimes. Coordinators have to work on weekends. Employee discount is only 10%, 20% several times a year.
This building is toxic. Leaders are poor and not open to feedback or ideas. You should just show up and hit targets that are sometimes unrealistic. When you explain what you need to be successful they don’t care. Development opportunities are limited unless you are on the “good” list. Once you share an unpopular opinion you go on the black list and forget ever getting considered again.
lack of development plan for people who have been with the company for 2+ Years. Seems that a lot of people are pushed toward certain roles that they may not actually want to work in.

There is $10,000 annual tuition reimbursement. They pay for actuarial certifications and give work time for exams. Used to be a pension & parking subsidy (parking costs $90/month in garage in Phx) but no more. Health benefits are good (although all high deductible plans, which work for me). Stock price is high. Take part in the 401(k) and buy stock! It adds up. If you join--try to negotiate as high a salary as you can since pay is not great. Use the tuition benefit and get an advanced degree in 2 years, stay a third so you don't need to pay it back, then leave. Bounce to a few other companies and come back if you want, since that's the only way your salary will increase decently. Good place for someone starting out or for someone coming from a state agency or MCO who can get a great salary. I gave it a thumbs up but would have liked to give it a neutral.

I’ve been at Mercer for over 6 years, and the amount of growth I’ve seen is stunning. Transformational, impactful work is being done. Pay is much better than 4 years ago. Caring colleagues.
Working at the team level is great, responsive PMs who are willing to help you succeed. The work is great intellectually speaking, but takes a while to pick up if you've never worked with Medicaid. There seems to be pretty decent upward mobility if you stick around for a while. They allow hybrid or full time remote work, and they don't really enforce any office attendance. At a local level they excel at organization. The pay is decent enough to tolerate the cons.
Mercer is a big name and in most cities people have heard of them, so warmer leads. Also, Your people manager will be great to work with, but that’s about it.
An absolutely incredible team, our benefits are fantastic! I love working for this company, very flexible. Lots of growth opportunity and extremely supportive.

There are some great people here and the work is challenging, mostly in a good way. Mercer is the largest investment consultant in the world and there is great opportunity to work on some large, meaningful client relationships. The best part of working here is the name recognition for future job hunting, everyone in the industry knows and respects Mercer.

I'm the kind of person who literally got so much energy, but even I got exhausted from the amount of work!
Good friendly, stable income, fun
Long hours are not immediately demanded as an entry level analyst. For the most part, a general 8:30-5:30 Monday to Friday. Hours are not entirely demanding as work rarely asks for extremely tight deadlines.
Compensation and exam increases were great
Good managers/teams, plenty of resources at your finger tips
Great benefits and the caliber of people is very high considering the intellectual capital
Really great colleagues -supportive and talented. Good tools and training.
Good benefits, good culture, flexible work schedule
Good opportunities for growth and learning
Before I started with Mercer, at least five people called me to welcome me aboard. This was very refreshing! The onboarding process was simple and my computer equipment was received before I started. Management made it clear in the interview that breaks and lunch are Mandatory. They want you to be happy and not stressed. Mercer provides PTO and separate sick leave day one. I have 10 days of PTO to use before the end of the year. They really foster a work life environment for their employees. All benefits start day one. Management is very professional and personable. My career training is three weeks long and I have been intrigued every step of the way. I am glad to be an employee of MMC and look forward to retiring from here.
","Work life balance could get rough at times.
The LA office is extremely toxic, especially for POCs. There are senior associates and principals who bully and retaliate. However, your manager or leadership will not do anything about it and will retaliate as well. Promotions are based on favoritism. Mercer does not practice what they preach to their clients at all. There is no diversity and they don't care about the health and well-being of their day to day staff. They want to work past your 8 hours and don't want you to log in overtime even though you are entitled to it. If you are a POC, expect to work much harder to get promoted.
Base pay increases for mid/late career didn’t keep up with inflation. In the wealth business, they were largely focused on growing assets under management. Being a well-respected high quality consultant used to be the goal many years ago. Often this would lead to revenue growth as clients trusted their consultant and would take their advice leading to increased services/sales. Employees were also treated like the key company asset that they are, resulting in various little perks. Things changed and the only thing that mattered was high sales/high billable hours. Mgmt didn’t really care about employee well-being or work-life balance, other than giving it lip service so they could ride the ESG bandwagon.
- Somewhat slow to adopt newer office technology like cloud solutions, simultaneous team editing, etc.
We were recently informed we are expected back in the office 3 days a week, unless we had already made our work from home status official (we were not made aware of this). Advancement process is inequitable--make friends with those at the top (or at least the top of your group). Really. Workload is too much for the reward. Pay is low unless you leave for a year. Then come back, make a lot more and get a promotion immediately or the following year. Stay and stagnate. Many left last year. No real repercussions for mediocre performance. No benefits for working night and day to meet/exceed client expectations and fill gaps others leave. Leadership does not want to hear even slightly negative feedback, which is necessary for positive change. Recent restructuring has raised billable hour goals to 1600 for virtually everyone this year (2023), which is a significant increase for many. (Although almost no nonbillable hours are expected outside of trainings, meeting as with supervisors and a few more quarterly meetings.). Employees mostly unwilling to go the extra mile. Leadership mostly unconcerned with opinions of the masses. Managers mostly will not help. Was a much more toxic environment, but working from home helped alleviate a lot of that. Backstabbing/sabotage is a real problem so beware. Most staff are decent; issues seem to be mostly involving managers/leadership staff. Disheartening to be an employee.
Lead consultants don't advocate for analysts/associates. Some lead consultants have no hesitation to throw the analysts under the bus in front of colleagues and clients. They really don't care about analysts and associates staying at work day and night as long as they get to go home before 5 PM. Long hours 1-3% annual salary increase; no negotiation toxic culture
I feel that the promotion is a bit slow
They are now requiring employees to go in to the office 3 days a week
The only major con would be the learning curve. At times it can be a little daunting, but this is the nature of the business.
Hours could be quite long. OT at the analyst level is nice
Can't think of any right now
Can be a little high stress at times
Relatively low pay compared to competitors in the industry. You offset some pay for job security since other areas of the business are used to offset lower performing areas.

Not enough employees and many are completely over worked
Lots of work that needs to be completed
Work life balance is hard in busy season Hard to spend time on projects with large client load
No one partners together based on incentive plan
In office three day a week
I would stay if the pay was better, competitors do pay more, but Mercer is the best for job experience.
Mercer is not a good place to work for low performers - frequent “reductions in force”, where they eliminate low hanging fruit. Compensation is not quite as good as what someone could get somewhere else. Diversity is lacking. Dallas office upper management is all male.
No real negatives to report
Return to office could be a problem/
Low pay for amount of work
Constantly training new hires (which I love) but it’s due to turnover, and feel like I can’t get ahead or accomplish what I need to do to meet goals (but somehow I always do). Just seems like so much extra stress to get it done.
Need to be able to work under tight deadlines and teach yourself sometimes
Town halls usually are about either management's efforts to hire more people or tell us to generate more revenue. Management seems unaware or uninterested in ways to retain staff of all levels. Management has launched a reorg that feels disorganized but I don't actually know because upward visibility is opaque. Once a year they take away our expense privileges for a while so we can't do office events or happy hours.
Local office leadership does not believe Sales Professionals should exist so therefore will treat you poorly and try to push you out. If you interview ask how much turnover in the last 5-10 years in the role, it’s horrible- Ask about their revenue generating growth in the last 5-10 years. Local office leaders think they understand sales, but have no clue what they are doing - hence no growth. Also, there is so much crap talking behind everyone’s back and no one is brave enough to discuss issues in person, everything it done through email. During your interview they will talk about how they are big into “family” but that is all a lie as well - tons of fluff, it’s a joke. Don’t expect your ideas to be heard either, they will toss them out of the window thinking they have great ideas, that in fact are pointless. If you are interviewing for the Sales Professional role - DO NOT DO IT, you will not be at Mercer long term and regret it. Grass isn’t greener…..
I wish we had unlimited vacation. Starting vacation is 4 weeks which is pretty great

You are expected to run at a thousand miles per hour and once you get up to speed you are expected to run at two thousand miles per hour.

Stressful job and lots of turn around and your treated like nothing and it can be hard to go the bathroom with calls after calls many temp agencies workers here and its very confusing and lots of firing or letting go too
Communication is not effective enough
Salary / lack of transparency into pay
Work load Work hours Not being able to break Too much going on Not enough of the right tools to be efficient
Sr Mgt out of (NY/CT) is more focused on each penny rather than client best interest, claims they are opened to suggestions how to improve the business - when faced with maki g that actionable, they immediately pass this off as a local office issue. Moderate to low pay, makes negative adjustments to sales comp to offset other losses.
Rewards and career development: • The only thing that matters for annual reviews for all but senior leaders is billable hours. While not unexpected in a consulting firm, other professional goals are ignored. As a result, professional development is not supported other than for actuaries to maintain their credentials. Billable hour goals are much higher than non-GHSC Mercer staff for the same career levels. • Non-actuarial employees have a narrow career path at GHSC and are excluded from the opportunity for many leadership positions. Pursuing advanced degrees and other non-actuarial professional development is not valued nor supported. • With the exception of paid time off, employee benefits are poor and not competitive with peer firms. In particular, health insurance contributions are much higher than peers and should be factored in if considering a job offer. • Mid-career staff are often hired for a particular type of work/expertise, but then are assigned projects that they are not qualified for and/or have no interest in doing due to the desperate need to find warm bodies to staff projects. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if there was any support for employees in this situation, but there is none. • Annual pay increases are anemic, and promotions have minimal effect on base pay. (Passing actuarial exams does increase base pay, although this leaves out any meaningful base pay increases for all non-actuarial employees). It is common to hear of colleagues leaving for 25-50% raises at other organizations, particularly for more junior-level staff. • Target bonuses are unobtainable, as the bonus pool is never fully funded. This should be factored in if considering a job offer. Bonus payouts are often larger at competitor firms, even if the target bonus is lower. Culture: • GHSC culture is dysfunctional at best and toxic at worst – your experience will largely depend on your manager and client team leaders. Toxicity is a particular problem in the Minneapolis office, where a handful of clients make up almost all work, and it is nearly impossible to avoid the toxic client leaders. • The culture is self-perpetuating in that the people who stay tend to be risk-averse and change-resistant (far more so than the usual actuary personality), and the people who have the ability/desire to push for change don’t stay. The culture is also perpetuated by its insular nature. There is virtually no communication between GHSC employees and all other Mercer employees. It is possible for someone at GHSC to spend decades there working on a single client, leaving them with no exposure to other ways of working, even within GHSC. • The narrow focus on billable hours has led to a culture of inefficiency, over-engineering, an above all a substantial amount of low-value work. Tools and systems are often out-of-date (e.g., Microsoft Access) since replacing them with more efficient tools would reduce revenue. Some projects are sold and completed not because they have any value for clients but solely because they produce revenue. • Culture is entirely top-down. Few staff (even long-tenured, senior employees) have an ability to affect decision-making. Uncreative, risk-averse rule followers are valued, while most dynamic employees who would make great leaders end up taking their talents elsewhere. • Turnover has always been a problem, with 2022’s turnover being so high it severely limited the ability to complete projects. (For example, multiple client teams had more than 50% turnover in less than one year.) Instead of seeking to understand why turnover is persistently high, leadership blame the Great Resignation or blame employees for “not having what it takes” while ignoring the fact that many of those employees have greater career success after leaving GHSC. • Employee retention is a critical problem, especially for mid-career staff. While GHSC does a good job recruiting mid-career staff, many of these people leave within two years, which means they were already considering leaving before they hit their one-year anniversaries. While entry-level staff likely don’t see the dysfunction and toxicity because they have nothing to compare it to, many mid-career realize GHSC is not a good environment and jump ship quickly. It isn’t unusual for mid-career employees to start and then go back to their previous employers less than one year later. • The saddest part about working at GHSC is seeing the employees who have been at GHSC for 15+ years and who have clearly lost all passion for work and are just going through the motions. These people bear no resemblance to their younger selves, and while they are good at their jobs, there is clearly no joy in working. The colleagues in this position I’ve talked to have told me they would like to leave but feel they are too old to make a change so accept that they’ll be at GHSC until they retire. So sad. Leadership: • Senior leaders are like Supreme Court justices – they have their jobs until they retire or quit. This is the foundation for so many of GHSC’s issues. Talented, motivated staff see limited opportunities to advance and so they leave the company. Change is nearly impossible to accomplish, as many leaders haven’t changed their mindset since the turn of the century. Kissing up to leaders and/or not challenging them is incredibly important, because they may have authority over you for decades. • The Peter Principle is on display every day. Many senior staff are in their positions because they’ve outlasted everyone else and have the most client-specific knowledge. But these people are often poor and insecure leaders who drive talented employees out of the organization in search of more responsibility and less micromanagement. Even when client leaders see significant turnover (e.g., one team I worked on had 25% of the team quit in a single month and more than 50% quit over six months), there are no consequences for failed leadership or even recognition that leaders could be at fault for employees’ leaving the company. • Questioning leadership will get you managed out of the organization. Some long-tenured leaders use the acronym CLM (for “career-limiting move"") to label employees whom they don’t consider “leadership material” based on refusing to toe the GHSC line at all times. • GHSC has a tendency to hire mid-career staff who have leadership experience on other organizations (as managers and/or department leaders) and turn them into individual contributors at GHSC. The amount of wasted talent I’ve observed is remarkable. This seems to be partly driven by long-tenured, insecure GHSC leaders defending their positions against new and more talented colleagues. (The corollary to this is that subservient employees with no leadership aspirations are overvalued and protected by leaders.) • Leadership botched return to office after the pandemic. They pushed hard for RTO (and pushed managers hard to make their staff RTO) and tried to justify this by touting the impact on productivity RTO would bring. However, half of GHSC senior leaders are full-time telecommuters who don’t even live in a state with a GHSC office. While this contradiction was obvious to employees, leadership never even acknowledged it.
The culture could not be more corporate, in that it is devoid of any culture. We had to track our time, hour by hour, which is such a morale killer even if it’s somewhat necessary. The good mentorship and talent seemed to leave, while more middle-management people dug their heals in. Great place to use as a launchpad for future career growth elsewhere.
Senior management is not trained in management and is made up of long-tenured employees of the company. Seriously lacking awareness of the internal situations and external trends.
There is no work life balance
Not really any cons here
Slow movement at times can be frustrating but things do get done
None honestly no complaints. Maybe parking.
Disorganization, poor leadership, not competitive salaries
Limited in-person work as office is hybrid

Since the acquisition of the company, things felt WORSE! The changes made within the management as well as the rules and policies made it awful difficult for us to adjust! The doubled benefits also meant doubled workload and hours which was HORRIBLY BRUTAL!!
Lot of work for pay
Lower paying compared to other companies
There can be long hours at times, which is to be expected
Very little work life balance
Hard work - but you will be rewarded.
There are some lazy people that force work on the better workers. Plus the pay isn't that rewarding.
Lots ok changes within company.
Consistently work long hours for majority of the year.
Can be long hours and inflexible work schedule.
Pulled in many directions at once
Flexible work hours and great cafeteria
Strange culture at times, lack of lift from higher ups, understaffed
Pay is on the lower end
Training, Newer Department startups, siloed departments
THE MANAGEMENT WAS PRETTY AWFUL WHEN IT CAME TO SETTING EXPECTATIONS. THEY EXPECTED THE CONSULTANTS TO TAKE ON FULL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PROJECTS WITHOUT PROVIDING THEM WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS. It was ridiculous. It led to consultants putting in brutal, exhausting, and stressful hours and even having the worst work-life balance. BEWARE!
Workload, very demanding, hard to navigate career paths (very self-driven), mediocre comp when compared to workload
No cons come to mind. I had a very positive experience.
The work ambiance was toxic and hostile due to some arrogant, fake, and aggressive people who thought that they were running everything and things would be terrible without their support, it was ridiculous. Their negative attitude lowered the overall morale of employees and pushed them to quit. I was one of them. Avoid torture. Stay away!
Little to no salary increase; no advancement opportunities
Leadership emphasizes development and work/life balance but difficult to achieve.
Too many meetings. It seems like we spend more time talking than working some weeks.
Hard to rank up, pay is low at time,

Recommendations for clients are applied in the firm, consistent re-orgs, leadership is not in touch, lots of burnout

Limited focus on employee satisfaction or follow through on feedback from employee satisfaction surveys. The annual merit process and lack of opportunity perpetuated low salaries for a number of the positions without proper market analysis.

There wasn't a day when I could be normally working, but everyday got me stressed and exhausted and that's because of the unrealistic expectations of the management! The amount of work was ridiculous that it could cause anyone to literally go INSANE!
Hard to rank up, pay is low at time,
Mercer did not care about development in new young hires. You are not assigned a direct report or team. Instead you are placed on at least 8 consulting teams. This means you have over 30 coworkers that you report to who are also staffed on at least 8 teams. When everyone is your boss, no one is your boss. Everyone is overworked and too busy. No question is a dumb question, but coworkers made it clear that most of your questions are not important enough for their time. The company is stuck in the glory days before the pandemic. Stories of how great the culture used to be when the offices are now empty. So many senior employees would share how everyone used to love working together, yet these employees never come into the office. Mercer is reducing its office space around the company which confirms that they do not care about company culture to support new hires. It was ""heavily suggested"" that no hires were in the office at least 3 days a week. This means nothing when you are sitting in your cubicle alone and still on zoom all day. I was on 8 teams for over 9 months and I had met most of my teammates maybe 3 times in person despite them being from the same office as me. No Zoom cameras on either so face to face contact is not important for a company that relies heavily on client relationships. All of this on top of terrible pay for the consulting industry Mercer loves to act like they are a big player in. Classmates from my university in the consulting industry were making over $30k more than me in the same city. I thought the pay would be made up for in the awesome company culture they raved about in the interviews. Turns out this was the culture 5 years ago when people actually came in. The guy who interviewed me came into the office maybe once a month...
Work life balance was nonexistent
Difficult to make much of a pay raise. They tend to value people that leave the company and then come back versus promote and give raises internally.
Because a matrixed organization, the reporting structure can be fuzzy and then sales results are confusing. You may not have total control over your own territory
Onboarding was clunky. Too much client work doesn’t allow to take advantage of training and become proficient user of tools
processes are not very efficient and hard to change them being such a large company
Anything below mid-level management (6+ years of experience) is severely lacking in terms of salary
I have nothing negative to say about Mercer(MMC). I started my career 3 days ago and I look forward to returning everyday. Management and colleagues are amazing and impressive! They are friendly, compassionate, and love working for Mercer.

wow where to start. compensation is a disaster. no one can predict what they will earn on a sale. partner sales are atrocious if your deal is under 60k don't even bother sending in smb. management is living on a different planet...from which they micromanage to all heck unless you make circle rep. promised six figures if you hit quota (funny bc I was 120% to quota and made less than 75k-which is less than ""OTE"") Be prepared to work 12 hour days for your first two years. as of Aug '23 70% of sales reps did not sell one unit over the last 3 months, and 80% of all revenue and units came from less than 10 sales reps out of over 800. yet management blames reps vs negligent overhiring practices and trying to stay out of the news for layoffs. also been part of a meeting (by accident) where upper management talks about reps as ""unintelligent"", ""lazy"" and ""not working hard"". good luck applicants!
We aren’t being paid. This business uses an intentionally difficult to understand commission structure, that is impossible to audit or challenge in any meaningful way. New reps are sold into the organization with an expectation of unlimited earning potential and a myriad of compensation options, but those payments never arrive. Quotas go up, sometimes totally arbitrarily, and Comp structure changes each fiscal. They don’t bonus you on time, or accurately. Management will send you to HR for asking about where your money is, and HR will send you back to management. These issues were brought to regional management and upper level management over six months ago. We are still not being paid.
Salary/Pay ranges tend to be lower than averages for markets and nationally. If you are not comfortable with change management philosophies, it can be difficult to keep up with being agile in your role's responsibilities and driving results.
too many moving parts- sometimes no one takes accountability
Very ""corporate"" not a small company, lots of rules to follow.
Limited resources Technology Silo mentality ""Not my job"" Pay
Responsible for the full ML pipeline, if there are pieces that aren't your cup of tea.
When I was hired, I was sold a dream that became a false reality. I was told that the best part about working at paychex was the exceptional culture and amazing work like balance. Couldn’t be further from the truth. For one, you feel like a chicken running around with its head cut off from all the different areas of focus they want you to implement. My main role was to sell payroll, which is complex being new, then they hammer you to be knowledgeable in other areas with HR and retirement and merchant service that you feel like you can’t ever become a subject expert in the one thing I was hired to sell which was payroll. Second, You are really just a number at this company. There is constant pressure to run faster and harder. They say selling season is the craziest month, but honestly they hammer you every month. You feel bad for taking anytime off because if you do, your meeting and eup numbers are down that week (naturally because you took time off) but then they expect you to come back and make up all your numbers you missed that week for for the month. It’s just all micromanaged down to the nth degree. You write multiple goals and commitment plans that are just iterations of the same thing that are a complete time waster. Third, don’t fall for the unlimited PTO BS. They make you feel bad for taking anytime off. It’s natural to not have as many meetings because you took time off! Don’t make employees feel like they can’t ever take time off when you sell them on unlimited PTO!! Fourth, the commission structure is so complicated that it’s hard to really determine how much you’re going to make on a sale. They change the structure too frequently too. When I was there they changed it to where if you didn’t hit 75% of units then you don’t get paid on any of those units you sold. That’s robbery in my opinion. You mean to tell me that if I bring in revenue for the company, I don’t get credit for it if it’s not a certain amount. Come one. Robbery. The mentorship program is useless. All my mentor did was show me how to submit a deal from the paperwork side. Which is overly complicated btw. Ultimately, I struggled to hit quota. My whole team struggle to hit quota regularly and then being new and having an underperforming territory that had 1.5 banks, because one was a solution branch, and CPA’s that hadn’t seen a paychex rep in 10yrs and took time to build trust, I struggle to hit quota. I still sold each month but not at 100%. Because of this my manager told me once I was off mentorship and there about 9 months if I wasn’t at 100% quota she had to let me go. After multiple conversations she told me it was black and white. I reached all my activity metrics for EUP’s and meetings, but not quite at 100%. She even wrote me up for it and put me on an improvement plan with threatening termination! How does threatening to fire someone help them improve! The worst part about it was my manager was newer in her role and had never been a rep in my position before nor had any sales experience!! So how could I feel like I’m taking advice from someone that’s been in my shoes to improve!! Talk about the blind leading the blind! Ultimately I felt backed into a corner and felt like I was going to be fired because my pipline wasn’t there and I was going to be fired so I left. This company is a complete hypocrite to what they teach you about business. How a business employees are their greatest asset and it’s cheaper to retain an employee than hire a new one. Yeah right. I was told that I was just a number and if I wasn’t at quota then I had to be let go. Dispite giving my best and trying. I mean I wasn’t even there a whole year yet!!! I was still in the learning phase!
Communication can be difficult in the remote environment.
Can be a bit boring at times
-Grossly underpaid. -Severely overworked. -The most unorganized company -Outspoken personality not desired. They want yes men and women who will not push back or question components that do not make sense. -Leadership does not need to have knowledge of job. -Managers are inadequate and do not offer any sense of guidance. -Stuck in the previous century when it comes to ways of doing things.
The turnover is insane. You will not get paid close to what they say. You get no yearly raises on your salary.
Micromanagement and have to get manager approval to apply for different positions
Micromanagement and company has changed a lot recently.
Very corporate, everything must fit in a box
Can be overwhelming with several different sales channels
Salaries are minimal and not getting better
not enough support for clients. too many employees holding too many accounts
Very quota driven and competitive
Not much room for advancement.
I didn't feel like I had a lot of assistance from management and had to learn a lot on my own. Then when leadership changed, I hoped it would get better, but upper management just really focused on getting new hires only, then sort of forgot about you.
Metrics and meetings take away from selling
No remote opportunities for this position
Management is horrible. They treat you like kids and nickle and dime you everytime you go over 40hrs a week. Too much micro managing.
you have to be willing to work. lots of cold calling & prospecting.
Limited PTO, customer service based
low starting salary for industry and needs improved customer support.
too much work, over loaded on the amount of clients. very little growth opportunities.
No longer remote. Only have the option for hybrid or in office. Have to work for them 3 years to be eligible for hybrid.
When you get a 2.88% annual increase from a multi billion dollar company, you start looking at other avenues. And then they implement RTO and you don’t live anywhere near a location. Advancement just stops because they WILL NOT be hiring for new, or allowing lateral moves unless you return to a branch. STUCK
A lot of customer service issues.
-Really high turnover( 3 managers in 4 months) - Most coworkers are very unhappy uncomfortable business culture -The Worst Part you have to fight for your sales once they are made anything Paychex can do to not pay you out they will -They have no system for tracking them( allegedly) so it's not their fault if you dont get paid. I have no idea how any of the sales employees can deal with this poor behavior from this company -Train you the wrong way then when it becomes a problem OOPS your to blame -glorified call center they make you use your own cell phone(which means they have access to your phone) -micro managed (once a month when sales are dues focus on very small insignificant details due to the giant disconnect with management mgr had never sold insurance absolutely no clue about the business whatsoever) -pushed for sales that aren't legit -poor business practice -very poor training -churn and burn not really interested in teaching you sales or the insurance business -outdated business practices methodologies -really odd woke culture and training videos - absolute no respect work life balance personal time mgr wants you to start at 7 and take calls past 6 and not get paid for any of it
Long hours during peak tax season
The only con I had working there was the shift changing. Given that the department I was in was relatively small, there wasn't a lot of room for flexibility with schedule changes.
-High cold call volume -Low base pay
Bad management, bad leads and coworkers
Everything else. Pay is not at industry standard. Raises/Bonuses were subpar this year even for highest rated employees. Work is moving to India and current employees are being forced to train them with no extra benefit to them. Highly overworked and under appreciated.
None I can think of.
you are a number . period
Management shifts mean you may be let go if they want there own selected personal.
Metrics and meetings take away from selling
No remote opportunities for this position
The main software we have to use is decades old, and we have to switch between a mashup of 10 other pieces of software to get anything done. The company is extremely disorganized and chaotic. They talk about culture but do nothing about it. Customers are unhappy because their payroll keeps getting messed up
Managers are unresponsive. There are many people who called off work, so be prepared to take on their work (as well as handling their mess) on top of your daily duties.
you have to be willing to work. lots of cold calling & prospecting.
Limited PTO, customer service based
low starting salary for industry and needs improved customer support.
Referrals are hard to come by in new-to-market/struggling territories. Churn and burn. Extremely boring work.
Low pay. Micromanaging supervisors/manager. Huge corporate red tape for any type of change request. No longer allowed to WFH full time. Same problems year after year with no real innovation.
Everything, management, workload is a joke. Good luck having a supervisor for longer than an month.
A lot of customer service issues.
Very low pay for entry level positions
Low end on salary for comparative roles at other companies Mediocre Work-Life balance after 3 years of service. None before that. Corporate is bad at communicating changes and making decisions that benefit employees
Long hours during peak tax season
During covid, there was a two separate calls going on, one where people were given a raise and the other were ppl were given a pay cut of over 10k. Worst job I had, the company says they care about work life balance but it’s all for show.
The only con I had working there was the shift changing. Given that the department I was in was relatively small, there wasn't a lot of room for flexibility with schedule changes.
Bad management, bad leads and coworkers
None I can think of.
Pay Repetitive Lack of commission Over supervision
Mandatory RTO, not a ton of employee appreciation
The compensation doesn't always keep up with the industry or inflation.
Lower base salary but competitive commissions
Pay No optional overtime Specific training on health insurance minimal
Do not have any cons to list.
Hard to get Merit Raises and/or Bonuses. Also hard to move into a different department.
Terrible pay, makes it difficult to stay
Well below industry standard pay Short frontline employee notice for major changes Concerns fall on deaf ears Most inquires receive ""corporate"" reply
Pay wasn't super high - probably average/slightly below for an IT-adjacent role
unit focus means people who sell high dollar services aren't as important as major discounters.
Low wage Removed WFH after stating if you have 3+ years of experience you can stay home Too much work for one job Bad communication
Nothing comes to mind as a con
Busy seasons can be stressful , but not unlike any business
Pay, no transparency, new CEO does not care about employees
The training could be better.
Total Target compensation very low compared to other industries
The company is forcing everyone back into offices after granting work from home. They will claim it was never permanent but thats how it was stated. The claim its for collaboration and their culture. They have no culture and they do not listen to employee concerns. Over worked in most departments.
the pay isn't high enough for a sales rep for everything they do.
Low base salary for the field
Huge disconnect between upper management and typical workers. Dishonest leadership practices. Unreasonable quotas.
can get stressful at times, high turnover
I feel that customer service could be better
Paychex sometimes delays getting comp plans out to the reps.
Mandatory RTO, not a ton of employee appreciation
pay and remote flexibility can be limiting
Does not offer competitive pay
The compensation doesn't always keep up with the industry or inflation.
Pay No optional overtime Specific training on health insurance minimal
Other companies compensate much more generously
no real attendance policy. Management
Nothing addition to share at this time.
-commission is capped for the first two months of your quarter and uncapped for the third month
pulling people back in from work from home. a lot of duplicate job entry tasks. inconsistency in process
Little team building, sometimes feel like just a number
Poor leadership in some areas of the company. They put career advancement above their team.
Everything need to learn from scartch, and you need to learn lots of stuff in a short amount period
12 month lead time before you start making serious commissions if you don't have expierence in the role. Difficult to find the right resources becuase they give you everything at once at a fast pace. Need to ensure you have engages team with expiernece to help fast track towards great sales interactions.
can get stressful at times, high turnover
I feel that customer service could be better
Paychex sometimes delays getting comp plans out to the reps.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/XPO-Reviews-E615153.htm,"I knew from the moment I received the phone call from XPO this will be a company I'll be working with for a while. Not because I needed a job to support a family of 7 including myself. But the opportunities that's created within the company for their employees. XPO's benefits and the one that stood out the most with me is the Dependent Care never had that before and with 2 kids under the ages of 2 is great help. If you're anyone like me whose big on personal development in life or at work XPO University has a huge library on training and courses to help create and develop better leaders and an overall better person. Another one is if you show that you want to take on new responsibilities and grow within the company its there for you as long as you show hard work and dedication. Personally I've only been with the company 5 months tomorrow but, I've came from being a dockworker for 3 of those months training to be a Team Lead 1 of those months to full fledge running my own Sector on a FAC shift which gets crazy. Just imagine my first 2 weeks as a dockworker I didn't think I would make being apart of a FAC shift . Without any full management training here I am killing it. All due to dedication, determination and ambition with that I knew that there were plenty potential opportunities of growth for any employee whose willing to take on the task.
Short drives and great pay
Feels like family. Drivers will help without asking. The vibe is good. The terminal is small for its size and will challenge you to be a better driver. Dispatchers are cool. Were all in this together. Show up on time, be ready to work and you will succeed
XPO has a lot of potential. New CEO (former CIO) is the culture driver that retains me and many others. There is a growing culture than before. This company feels still start up in many ways with processes. They move fast so if you like fast, this is a good fit.
Good management and pay always on time
Top out pay is decent money Not too much micromanagement
Ops and Safety do a great job doing employee engagements. It’s a lot of out of box things they do which is great
Pay is decent; health benefits on day 1 with 60 days from hire date to enroll; job is “generally” easy
28 years at this company and it provided a wonderful life. Vacation time is good, co-workers are amazing
Great company as a whole.
You will never be bored and will work with some very smart individuals, decent work/life balance and pay, there are a lot of opportunities to do different things like work on projects, move to different teams in the company and try new things. Internal growth is very possible although it's not always upwards it could be lateral. Culture is fun and laid back. It's not super political and people just want to get their job done and they make it happen.
Salary and Benefits are the pros.
Career growth. Sr Leadership support.
Compensation, benefits, and team morale
Flexible & liberal PTO policies.
Fast pace good money and lots of hours
Fast paced, good people, multiple shifts, matching 401, other comparable company benefits
Not a bad job honestly
Benefits are above plans of other employers. Pay is also above others in this area.
Only thing I can say is the guy that guided me through my onboarding Eric Rivas.
Good co-workers and break room
Career growth. Sr Leadership support.
Compensation, benefits, and team morale
Flexible & liberal PTO policies.
Transparent pay, benefits, somewhat of a family environment at the Chester Va terminal.
Fast pace good money and lots of hours
Great experience to have under your belt! Many opportunites to expand trucking knowledge They stage you several area routes every year. Some times on liftgate, most in 53 foot dry vans. Trucks are new and mostly automatic. Still have a couple stick. Decent pay and they keep up with competitors pay.
Fast paced, good people, multiple shifts, matching 401, other comparable company benefits
You'll make plenty of money on night time line haul, you'll just be to tired to spend it. I'd say weekly depending on where you ran 1,500 to 1,900 take home.
Good environment to work in.
Job security for drivers and support staff.
Has all resources needed mostly to operate as a leader in the industry efficiently
Worked with some great people.
First SDE job, supportive colleagues.
Overtime XPO has designed a company of Fun and Adventure. Within the nucleus of the design exists a group of Chief Level Executives who champion employee engagement and success. Overall, this company aims to provide to 100% of its employees an equitable and healthy ecosystem, inclusive to the expression of thought and creativity.
Good salaries for those in hourly and salaried positions
Meet some great people Pay is fair and top rate is achievable relatively quickly Satisfied after a day's work Paid time off is fair and you don't need to give much notice Treated fairly in my experience Will hire newly licensed CDL holders
(1) Great People (2) Collaboration across Sales, Finance, and Operations Leadership (3) Relatively transparent feedback Culture
Love the people I work with - everyone is professional and friendly across all various channels. The strong leadership in this company was a reason I chose to stay during the divestiture back in 2022.
Great leadership capabilities at XPO
Local Management Team is great and are trying really hard to keep things going besides all the BS.
The corporate work environment is pretty relaxed. Its hybrid, working 2-3 days from home. Weekly pay and lots of on the job learning with MicrosoftExcel. Grateful for the experience. Lots of potlucks and picnics.
Awesome pay home every day

Company as a whole I’ve had no complaints in the time I was employed. Dockworkers were great and drivers where just as well.
There were a few: fairly casual dress code, nice office with great amenities, pretty decent coworkers on average.
learn a lot while working with XPO such as the clerical, admin, management side. you can be a FOS but you will have the opportunity to learn every aspect of the business
While the industry itself can be unpredictable, XPO is non-union which removes a lot of uncertainty.

XPO is the best place I have worked at in my more than a decade of engineering. I have previously worked for large Multinational companies, as well as smaller companies. My current job with XPO is one that I am proud to say that I am planning to hold until the day I can retire!
A tremendous amount of growth opportunities if you’re willing to work hard and actually contribute.
Pay was very good. You get compensation for everything you do.
","With any employer theirs always someone with a negative mindset towards the company, management, pay, the tools to do the job, what's needed of them and what they say not doing, etc. And worst of them all complainers. Don't let those kinds of people determine your success.
Must work docks full either line haul or p&d
HOT! HOT! HOT! Working in this environment especially off loading freight from trailers will challenge you. Bring plenty of fluids, towels and extra shirt.
Still dealing with old culture when we had NAT and New Breed and that leadership. Compensation is middle of the market at the best - so culture doesn't really stop me from looking when I get reach outs.
Had to load and unload trucks
Company will go off policy for any mistake you make. I am scared to lose my job over the smallest mistake now. My reasoning being that there is no second chances. You must be perfect or you will be wrote up/fired expeditiously. One of my friends dropped a trailer and no damage occurred. They reported it the next shift instead of immediately (they did not know about the 4 hr policy AND were not aware it was an accident as no damage occurred) and they were promptly let go. They did not believe it counted as an accident until they contacted a supervisor to ask if it was counted as an accident at XPO. They informed them that yes, indeed it still counted as an unreported accident. Therefore if you so much as jump your king pin or drag the landing gear doing a tug test you better report it. No damage happened but my friend was living proof it doesn’t matter. If you need a quick buck this company would work
Some employee attitudes suck but not unbearable
Flat out honesty: IT’S TOO FRIGGIN HOT out on the open-docks! Need large industrial-size fans mounted to keep air blowing and proper ventilation, especially in the spring/summer! The job itself can be very challenging most times and having to deal with extreme humidity makes it worse. XPO can afford to put fans in, regardless of whether they rent or own a terminal, so do it!! Furthermore, change the whole process of PRO-ing freight. It’s ridiculous how much freight has to be unloaded from trailers, separated, and then re-child PROed, and then loaded into the appropriate trailer(s)…wastes so much time! XPO has to and can change this! Finally, change your management system…very poor from what I saw. Need supervisors who know what they’re doing and can manage properly, even if that means having more than 1 supervisor especially for the outbound shift. Some supervisors are so focused on how a trailer is loaded when they need to focus on helping the staff get done! It’s pathetic when the shift is 12:00-8:30 PM and getting done at an average of 9:30-10:00 PM, or later, every night mostly. Insane! You have no life on second shift at XPO.
Benefits could be a bit better, but they are not terrible
The teams are disconnected and disorganized. No communication and you will be given the work of two or three positions, with no additional pay or incentives.
PLEASE negotiate before you get in the door here because getting pay increases is SO HARD. Also, this is a Fortune 200 company that acts like they are dirt poor. When we say lean with limited resources we mean it. There has been a lot of change but I don't know that this belongs in the ""cons"" section necessarily however if you don't like having a new team, project, process, or boss every couple of years this is not the place for you. You need to be okay with constantly building new relationships and proving yourself to new leaders. In most cases don't expect a high touch onboarding process, you may need to find the answers to your questions and introduce yourself to your stakeholders and co-workers. Benefits are just okay but suffice for my partner and I.
PTO Policy Work Schedule - 6 Days per Week (11+ hour shifts DAILY or point deduction All Drivers are required to work the dock after completing their deliveries for the day. Write up/Point deduction if tardy, emergency call off, running out of driving hours, etc. Annual lay offs/termination causes extra work for drivers. Driver is responsible for loading and unloading trailers. No work/home balance
There can be longer days when you first start but it will even out as you get a grip on your roll and make your terminal your own.
I do not have many cons. It’s a great company
Enormous amounts of micromanaging & physical tracking of your whereabouts.
Not a lot of staff to help complete the orders
Still new, haven't had any major issues that needed to be handled.
Hard work and hot in the summer
Senior Management is poor. Different focus every week, nothing is sustainable. District Managers are inexperienced and it shows, and the Safety Department is is a joke. Work balance does not exist.
Everything else is a joke. From the disengaged District Leadership, the lack of training and most important the racism towards minorities. It is so bad now that even my Manager which used to a true politician when leadership showed up now is walking around like he is ready to bounce at any given time. I hard this place was bad but now I know why and it is not because of the local people but because of who is leading the people that is supposed to lead the hourly.
Horrible management and old equipment
There can be longer days when you first start but it will even out as you get a grip on your roll and make your terminal your own.
I do not have many cons. It’s a great company
Enormous amounts of micromanaging & physical tracking of your whereabouts.
Management can tend to show favoritism, starting out as a “new driver” you have no seniority so you won’t get the most hours and will have to work dock to offset driving hours. You have to work the dock.
Not a lot of staff to help complete the orders
Safety was a concern for me when it came to the freight. For most part they practiced great safety at company dock etc. But when it came to the freight we picked up at places that contained crystalline silica etc they didnt care for you breathing it in (causes cancer) they only cared about you bringing it in. You make a deal out of it and they look at you crazy. All this time you were under the impression safety was everything and we were like family (their words). Mill runs were awful too. Asbestos is almost every corner and they did not care for any complaints at xpo. When work is hectic, even tho you have busted your buttocks over road and unloading freight, they might make you stay longer to help dock workers unload trailers after you have completed your shift
Still new, haven't had any major issues that needed to be handled.
Working the dock exposed to the elements, management, but that's everywhere and slow trucks 64,65mph. Long work hours so poor worklife balance.
Split shift unless you like that.
Managing operations with individuals who don't have an operational background results in a negative outcome. Regularly asked to add mileage to freight needlessly resulting in changes to common sense planning. Utilizing poorly designed and maintained equipment to move freight, but being scored on metric that show your daily capability at 100%. On-board freight security systems being installed with cheap and faulty components leading to less than desirable capabilities. Double standards for folks who ""know"" someone.
Lot of changing faces - Could be due to wave of overinvestment to expand warehousing/truck capacity numbers, maybe not the best time to take on loans with post pandemic rate overlapping of tasks with different teams can cause less than ideal results / culture. As long as you play the part and cozy up to mgmt you could be a lazy worker and have no threat to job security. Raises were subpar
Stressful at time when dealing with unhappy customers.
frustrating management changes, lack of clear career progression, outdated tech stack
In terms of Mid-Level management or the nuclear membrane. Within this layer exists ego's that need to be set aside in order to further advance the company as a whole.
Company struggled with a long term strategy.
Long hours Dock work is half of the job Unpredictable how long you will work each day unless you are high in seniority Some supervisors (most are good) Some (only some) senior drivers will look down on you - be ready to put your time in and grind for a while to earn your place
(1) Turnover of Executive Leadership (2) Lack of consequences for customers that do not pay invoices within agreed upon payment terms
Not a lot of career opportunity within my area - I would need to dive into other areas of XPO to grow my career.
Strenuous work hours is a big con
Worse Leadership in the history of LTL. The amount of politics and bureaucracy that you have to fight daily is the worse in my 12 year career. People are dropping like flies and there is no end in sight.
Training leaves much to be desired. It lasts about a week or 2 and has almost nothing to do with the actual job role.. after training, if you dont figure out how to ask questions about what you already don't know, it can be seen as you not trying. If you take this job, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions from you management and peers, even if you're not really sure what questions to ask. Recently, the work load increased significantly after we were told we would be made salary. They told us we would get a raise, but the raise came nowhere near close to appropriate for the incredible work load increase. I personally went from having 2 large accounts to 19 accounts for a 2 dollar raise, no overtime pay. Naturally, it has been a bit stressful at times.... In the year I've been with the company, I've seen 8 managers in my department alone -from regular manager to sr director - leave the company or get ""released"". The employees take on the strain of poor and inconsistent management. Management is almost never promoted from within, insteadthey are hired on brand new. There are analysts that have been with the company for years that aren't offered promoted positions. Instead, on top of their normal tasks and accounts, the more tenured analysts are ""gifted"" with more responsibility, such as training employees on the floor because, again, training leaves much to be desired. The only thing I can say that has really been consistent, ironically, is the inconsistency due to such high turnover. Working to stay positive within yourself is the best advice I can give to anyone curious about working as an analyst at XPO.
Long hours 12-16 hours dock work required
With any employer theirs always someone with a negative mindset towards the company, management, pay, the tools to do the job, what's needed of them and what they say not doing, etc. And worst of them all complainers. Don't let those kinds of people determine your success.
Management as a whole has gone the wrong direction and more toward micromanaging. Along with constant unnecessary change in the work environment. Hiring of new managers that barely know the job, but may know the industry is the problem.
This is a longer list: The pay is minimal and benefits marginal. Advancement is very difficult without time/needless self sacrifice, though they have no problem hiring connected outsiders for leadership positions. Speaking of 'leadership', supervisors would rather openly gossip/denigrate coworkers and watch TV on their phones than provide direction, guidance or support, yet they were quick to jump to conclusions which often were incorrect. I got the feeling of always being under surveillance and was frequently second guessed with no efforts made to understand the situation at hand. Upper management was friendly enough and put up appearances. Middle management proved to be both unprofessional and dishonest. This company does not even pretend to trust their employees and will ask for more and more while offering next to nothing in return. Entire team was laid off with very minimal notice.
No growth. Even with a degree you won't go anywhere. it is who you know that will get you somewhere. Pay is average but they can do better with how much money they make
Benefits are really the lowest common denominator.
Long hours make it hard to schedule appointments during the day
Hard to be promoted within the company
Hard to be promoted within the company
Lack of leadership from management.
Service is terrible, damage Freight and hold sales to an unrealistic goal.
Management can be better, older equipment/newer equipment, small yard, overworked.
They will literally work you to death. Equipment is falling apart and as the new guy you drive what breaks down frequently.
Shift hours are terrible that’s about it
not willing to negotiate salary
No work from home flexibility unless you hit productivity goals after 3 months. High turnover rate in the customer care department
-Management only cares when their job is in jeopardy -Working on an open dock can suck during the summer and winter
This is a general overview of the corporate communications team for the US. It’s a disaster. The leaders are only good at one thing - delegating. They don’t give direction and make excuses for all the issues that occur. People are burnt out and the culture is toxic. Everything is being made more complicated. The biggest mistake XPO made was spinning off because the good people are all leaving or have left, and now we are stuck with leaders who don’t even know how to write or plan campaigns. If anyone in HR reads this, please look into comms leadership because this is not acceptable. The team is being treated as the help and our experience is no longer being valued. We can’t even give feedback because we end up being threatened and mocked. To anyone looking at joining the Greenwich team or comms team, run away.
Bad supervisors, no one held accountable

This is the trucking industry. What do y ou mean?
Long hours make it hard to schedule appointments during the day
Wife left lol to many hours
No cons to list for XPO
Hard to be promoted within the company
Lack of leadership from management.
There’s quite a bit of favoritism. If you are a favorite, you can do anything you want and get promoted anytime you’re ready. If you’re not a favorite, then management treat you like a robot and does not respect you
No one is ever here to drive the forklifts.
Must work lots of over time
60 hour weeks are the easy ones.
LTL business has declined in service and lost customer share for several years. Always chasing Old Dominion and not closing the gap.
nothing really cant think of any
Company is moving in a great direction, with growth comes opportunity
Just hard Work , unsafe trailers , dispatch fills your trailer with pickups until your out of room, no get off work schedule, cannot plan anything , if you do you will have to cancel out.
Dock required , get hold back by supervisors at dock
Management, HR IS HORRIBLE, Dispatch a joke , not a good work atmosphere for all
Bad supervisors, no one held accountable
Local management doesn't have empathy for workers. Pits workers against each other
Bad Work life balance, long hours, lack of training
- work / life balance - inconsistent supervision staffing standards for service centers of same size and class facility. - ""what have you done for me lately"" mentality - inconsistent hiring practices between internal and external candidates - too wrapped up in woke culture
Pay is not great, but the job doesn't require a lot of hard work
No room for growth, benefits are terrible, unreal expectations and
Workload distribution. The entire company down to the processes, management, styles, office aesthetic, employee attitudes,, and standard procedures are VERY outdated. In comparison to other companies I have worked for, XPO needs better efficiency and modernization.
When working Nightine Linehaul you will be a traveling dock worker. Your HOS mean nothing to this company
long hours, mandatory to be in office, (if you care about that type of thing)
This is the trucking industry. What do y ou mean?
Hard two advance. Don't value Hard work,commitment only senior status and u feel it everyday
Long week 60 - 70 hours every week A lot of dock work No sick time, have to use PTO for everything
none to report. do your job, help where you can.
bad equipment and system in place
Lunch break Salary - No money after 40 hours
There’s quite a bit of favoritism. If you are a favorite, you can do anything you want and get promoted anytime you’re ready. If you’re not a favorite, then management treat you like a robot and does not respect you
No one is ever here to drive the forklifts.
The plant is older, so there is a need for updating. This is something that the management team is constantly working on.
None that come to mind.
Hours are long on somedays, but that is to be expected.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMC-Entertainment-Reviews-E758.htm,"great work environment with great people
Easy first job. The work itself was enjoyable and extremely easy once you got the hang of it. 50% off concessions and food. Free movie tickets.
If you prefer by the numbers procedures and operations, then AMC is the perfect fit. A corporate culture where everything is laid out in an exacting fashion, focusing entirely on business. A magnitude of education, support, and guidance provided. Professionalism, measurable results, and an adherence to the company line are valued. Standard industry pay and benefits, with lucrative bonuses available at select locations. Plenty of opportunities to advance, if you are patient, fit in, and are willing to relocate.
I've worked my fair share of minimum wage jobs, most of the time I would get 4 5-hour shifts throughout the week. With AMC, most shifts could be around 7-8 hours. Even with just 3 shifts, I would get more hours from working. Hours aside, AMC has always been a fun place to work. Lots of down time with easy tasks to bond with your coworkers, and, if you have a good lead to plan the rushes, they could be really fun.
-Flexible hours -Outside of blockbuster movie release windows, the work load and environment are very chill. During blockbuster movie release windows it is absolute madness and nowhere near worth the pay
During non peak days (weekends,tues,fri)/hours/ seasons(everything but summer really, unless it’s a big movie) it’s pretty chill, steady stream on guest(that’s what we call them) or if it’s like Monday, then barely any.
It was a fun place where you get to know a lot of people.
-free movies/ popcorn & drinks -learn different skills
Working on set can be magical Intellectually stimulating work No two days are the same Good coworkers
It’s honestly a really fun environment getting to work at AMC. If you’re a movie buff you get to hear about all the upcoming new movies and posters. You get a discount on theater snacks and free tickets!
Unlimited free movie tickets and 50% off on concessions. Easy to learn new positions. Pretty solid hours during the summer.
Chill, laid back environment and everyone is friendly and nice.
Friendly staff and easy training process for new employees
-Flexible hours -Outside of blockbuster movie release windows, the work load and environment are very chill. During blockbuster movie release windows it is absolute madness and nowhere near worth the pay
Fun, easy, well paced and free movies
AMC has to be without a doubt one of the most supportive and accepting workplaces i’ve ever been a part of. now this definitely varies theatre to theatre, but at my location specifically, our management has a backbone, and will stand up for us every single time. I’m visibly queer, and there have been multiple instances of me getting accosted and harassed by guests, and not once has management failed to defend me, going so far as to ban people from our theatre and get law enforcement involved. I’m well aware this should be the bare minimum, but you’d be surprised how much of a luxury it really is
Work with groups of people can be enjoyable. Often doesn't even feel like a job
Love my co-workers and management is awesome
Great work-life balance, great team, cool environment
Tips are good when you are a bartender. Also depends on location

great work environment with great people
Great Part Time job for students.
The people you meet can become life long friends. You have the opportunity to learn everything you ever wanted to learn about movies, projectors, scheduling, juggling, multi-tasking, all at once.
Working in a heavily busy environment helped me sharpen my quick thinking skills.
You can slack off, do nothing, and still get paid.
You can get tipped, it’s a pretty simple and easy task. You will have a lot of free time, depending on how busy the day is.
Free movies to see anytime
Free movies, discounts on concessions. Fun work environment.
Free movies! Free popcorn. The guests are almost all awesome to work with because they’re self-selecting, meaning they’re almost always there to have a good time, which makes work fun (unless for some obligatory reason). “Big tent vision” when it comes to entertainment that’s hard to beat experience-wise, especially in terms of range of selection of movie titles and show times, in special / premium formats, etc.
","stressful on big movies relase days
90% of the employees were children and treated the work place as Highschool, gossiping and bullying other employees including full grown adults. Those children are also very unprofessional and lack work ethic and do bare minimum to get by. Management doesn’t help much either when it comes to conflict with other employees.
If you tend to be creative or open minded in your approach to business, AMC is not a good fit. There is little flexibility and no place for any dissenting opinions. The focus is entirely on the numbers, with the people and experience being little more than afterthoughts. Very easy to become lost, forgotten, or unappreciated within the big business corporate structure. The company's employee performance/potential evaluation places you in a literal classification box; you will never know where they have placed you on the grid or the reasoning behind their decision, but that classification defines your career path and the opportunities made available to you.
As always, the vibe of the work place heavily relies on the management. AMC also pushes the crew to sell stubs accounts with little to no incentive for the workers.
-Constant call outs by all employees (from porters/ushers all the way to management). Most are teens so it's understandable. -Managers will 'go missing' during peak rush hours occasionally, leaving kitchen/runner staff to fend for themselves during insane rushes. -Lower level employees are constantly 'leaned on' to perform management tasks, but when performance reviews come around they 'don't have the money' to promote to management. -The elevator in the back of the building (used for employees to come in the back and do trash runs to the garbage compactor downstairs) has a 1x2 foot hole in the floorboard, its not safe. The garbage disposable room is a LITERAL HEALTH HAZARD. I am not exaggerating when I say that AMC corporate should issue us hazmat suites for us to do trash runs. Both of these things have been an ongoing issue for months with zero action from management.
All busy days are going to feel like a non stop rush because it’s a small theater. On top of that we usually don’t have enough people when it’s busy to help with everything and there will always be a fire that needs putting out (restocking, quick restroom checks, a guest needs something, a seat isn’t working). Closing sucks cuz we get out at like 1 or 2 am. Also my least favorite job is usshering (cleaning the theaters. But you have to keep in mind that by comparison to my other jobs that are similar, this is the easiest one. You just get a little complacent.
They don’t always promote in the order they should.
The customers. Favoritism with promotions.
Extremely long hours Some legacy producers are toxic Constant changes
It can be hard though when guests get upset about circumstances out of our control or they’re just having a bad day but overall I’d say it’s worth it. Instead of being front of house at this location there’s another option to work in the kitchen since it’s a dine in. Just in case employees don’t want to be as guest oriented there’s the option to be a cook but there is always much to do in the back and lots of cleaning to be done.
Working hours will dramatically drop during the fall in comparison to the summer (30 hours per week to 8). Customers can be kind of rude depending on time of day.
The pay is really minimal
May not see much benefits, only about a 20% discount on items but free tickets are still available

Low pay, some benefits, could be better
The scheduling can be VERY inconsistent, and many if not most theatres are over staffed. couple that with the declining rate of moviegoers, and that results in a severe lack of hours to go around. When i brought up my concerns to my general manager, he dismissed me saying that he doesn’t have enough crew with the availability he needs. I actually had to file a HR complaint against him to get him to stop hiring.
It brings in a lot of younger crew members so drama is a given.
Sometimes can be super slow
can be hectic during movie rushes but you just got to go with the floor, closing shift can keep you there late
late nights, always open, can get really hectic at times

- Either is overstaffed or understaffed. No in between. Meaning that your hours get cut, or work days are stressful. - Poor communication (getting better though) - Cliquey co-workers and lots of gossip - Deserve to be paid more
Management can be rude, no choice but to work on holidays without extra pay.
No room for growth Horrible management Bad company
Sometimes lots of drama between coworkers.
Can be chaotic if too busy
Don't take sexual harassment seriously Super low pay
Can have crazy rushes for new movies being in Disney Springs and more frequent special events. Employs many high-school and college age crew that can vary wildly on work ethic.
very late hours on the weekends.
Drama with coworkers and lack of incentives
Weird power dynamics and hierarchy
Long night, working holidays. Future of company
Low pay Micromanaging Slow at times
Will often get overwhelmed/overworked during peak seasons Understaffing is a corporate decision Favoritism plays a heavy factor in promotion viability/day-to-day treatment Management will often put some of their responsibilities off on those under them. Lack of understanding of neurodivergent needs/accommodations is blatant.
Customer service isn’t always great.
Doesn’t pay well It’s good if your looking for something on the side
Nothing really that bad good first job
sticky sticky sticky sticky sticky
Management can be stubborn and unreliable
Pay and it’s not meant to be something you do long term.
Base pay is $10, with no bonuses. All the workers are teenagers which seems to cause some drama and is typically an easy job. I don't feel that I am being challenged in anyway and I am not guaranteed good hours. typically during the school year I was only working about 2-3 days a week all being about 4 hour shifts, and a lot of the time being sent home early due to slow business or being overstaffed.
None everything was good from my end
We converted from a Cinetopia to an AMC and AMC did not do any updates, cleaning, or refurbishments during the switch. We were constantly out of certain cups, food products, or promotional materials (which patrons always asked for - rightfully so!). We even ran out of napkins and had to put the bulk paper towel roles on the counter. It was so embarrassing to constantly say ""no"" to customers' (usually very reasonable) asks just because we were out of the basics. Everyone who worked there was nice and committed but AMC just didn't show up for us and we were always ashamed to be operating such a run-down location from such a huge corporation.
Some employees lack respect for their supervisors becuase we are not managers.
Not for the faint of heart when it comes to dealing with the public.
Everything else the job had to deal with
Long hours without breaks. You're not allowed to eat or drink, if you want to take a quick break–5 minutes or less–you have to find someone to cover for you. You're not allowed to sit down. We would stand for 8-10 consecutive hours.
Amc is more of a afternoon-night job which is annoying, no tip for selling tickets or food which makes sense but feels disappointing, while schedules are flexible, for me I never knew I will get one or three shifts the next week which stressed me out.
Not enough pay at this
Minimum wage pay… tough customers once in a while
1. Have to work like a dog with no breaks for 8 hour shifts 2. Cleaning up peoples disgusting trash and having to carry said 30 lb trash 3. Getting paid practically nothing for doing everyone's job
Weekends and nights are kinda lame
pay is not great, the manager are something hard to deal with
Pay is not the best
Huge crowds Rude people Customers
Pay was low but it's a typical movie theater job so it's somewhat expected.
barely any money made at all
I think the pay could be better.

*Lack of hours they provide. I went from work 4-5 shifts a week, to being cut down to only 2 shifts, which is hard since I have responsibilities such as rent, and school. *lack of communication with specials and deals. Often times we are left in the dark about certain big promotions, which is stressful coming in and being asked question about a topic the crew is not educated on or even aware of. *mistreatment of power. The higher ups, not all but some have done questionable things, it’s nothing serious, but they are also things that fall back hit the crew members the hardest.
Holidays can be tough since its so busy

Not a great career option due to limited pay and growth.
Everything else the job had to deal with
Very rare opportunity for advancement
It gets very busy in the summer
low pay and odd hours
My area had high turnover rate. Working with mostly minors and early college aged workers (drama). Not a stable schedule. Very little kudos from corporate. Don’t expect any bonuses or more than $1 raise per year (if you’re lucky).
Management can be a pain in the rear
-Gets very busy during new movie releases and weekends -Understaffed at times
They don’t give two craps about their employees. Pay the bare minimum and expect the most from them. We can go across the hallway to any store in the mall and get paid more and not be required to work until 2a and holidays.
Working the food counter was stressful
Late night hours are not so fun but that's part of the job.
Long hours, work with kids
Tips are completely at the mercy of a movies success. Expect to need a second job once notable movie releases begin to dry up. Very Corporate, limited cocktails on the menu. Very few benefits, but that's normal for the service industry.
Pay could be higher for most positions
Unorganized, filthy conditions, unethical requests in day to day tasks, shady operations
Low pay, hard work, very busy at times.
Cliques, unpredictable management, constantly having to get management for issues
The company human resources was one sided
Things at AMC do tend to be more lax than many other employers, which is often times a pro, however it certainly can serve as a detriment to employees at times. Responsibility tends to be distributed fairly well, however it was relatively common to find responsibility was shouldered unevenly especially during busy days.
You meet some of the worst customers every week and ushering the messiest theaters for $11 an hour.
Hours were short, into late nights
When I worked there, one of the managers was very lazy.
Not a great career option due to limited pay and growth.
stressful on big movies relase days
Low pay is a con though.
Be prepared to be married to the job, the theater, your coworkers.
The management at my location was unorganized, and I was never properly trained.
All the people who slack off translates to some people being abused by always doing all the work.
Can get busy, and very hectic at times.
Horrible, horrible, customers, low pay.
Holidays and weekends job. But still flexible.
Potentially dangerous tasks like dealing with cleaning chemicals, scalding hot plates, washing sharp metal panels, carrying extremely heavy buckets of water, mopping, etc. may or may not be worth the risk for the compensation offered (absolute legal minimum, at least in the State of California).

I am a Solution Architect that prefers to be customer-focused, and I absolutely love working for this company. I am armed with data and with plenty of resources to call-upon when trying to help my customer's design their solutions. I don't have to be the master of everything on-premises and in-the-cloud, but when I call on those resources to help me out, there is an expectation that I will stick with them and use the opportunity to learn. It isn't just about us selling stuff, but I feel like I get a chance to grow every day in my job.
Culture is one of the best I’ve ever had
Work Life balance was good. High visibility depending on group.
- Great Mid Level Managers - Great co-workers - great culture
Has an exceptional culture, nice coworkers, and an easy going, relaxed annual review process. Managment have held true to their work from home policy. Treats employees very well with periodic mental health days off.
employee friendly with great benefits and great work
I have been at NetApp for almost 3 years and am so grateful to be a part of an amazing company.
Decent Pay. Good work life balance.
Work life balance Lot of paid benefits Not too fast paced Flexible working hours
Engineering focused company and good teamwork. Nobody will let you drown.
The work was really good, pay was as per the market standards and had some really smart people in the team. Loved every day of it while working for the company.
One of the good places to work.
RTP is a great location to work.

","Recent restructuring may impact longer term goals Periodic restructuring is way of life
Too many org changes leaves people guessing.
Change can cause pain. Layoffs as the company evolves into a hybrid cloud leader while increasing profits and stock price. Getting younger by leveraging internal post-college training program
Over pivoted to cloud, new tech leaders are bring it back to on prem focus, but it has taken time. Pricing is high, leadership will approve discounts to be competitive, but reps deal with lots of cycles of approval.
No cons working at NetApp.
To be blunt, NetApp cannot get out of its own way. There is a severe lack of systems and process infrastructure that creates a crippling amount of inefficiency. In addition, there is no funding to invest in improving these areas. I was there 6 years and the minimum improvements that were made during that time didn’t even begin to move the needle.
Upper management is unaware of workload
Lot of message confusion, probably will change again soon
Firing , Less growth opportunities
Not much growth in general
Learn how ot manager your own career and you will do fine.
I worked at NetApp for a few years and it was one of the worst work experiences I have ever had. The company's frequent layoffs and workforce reductions made it a place of constant instability and fear, where employees were more concerned about their own job security than working together to achieve shared goals. In such a toxic work environment, employees tended to backstab each other, spreading rumors and sabotaging each other's work to gain an edge in the constant competition for job security. This further eroded morale and made it almost impossible to build a sense of team spirit. The frequent layoffs also led to a lack of continuity and stability, with projects being started and then abruptly abandoned, or teams being restructured and reshuffled every few months. This made it difficult to get any meaningful work done, and employees were constantly worried about whether their jobs would still be there the next day. Overall, NetApp is a company that seems to prioritize short-term profits over the well-being and development of its employees. The constant layoffs and workforce reductions create a culture of fear and mistrust, where employees are more likely to backstab each other than collaborate to achieve shared goals. I would strongly caution anyone considering employment at NetApp to think twice and carefully evaluate the company's track record with layoffs before making a decision
Unfortunately there are too many fiefdoms at NetApp, especially in the manageability groups. NetApp has always had too many tools in the management tool box (which customers complain about) yet they would and could not join them together due to the ego's of those in charge, even though they all work for NetApp and should just be working to help make NetApp a better company.
Some senior leaders are not inspiring and can be overly negative Product roadmap and strategy experiencing lots of churn - optimistic about future, but some teams are having trouble letting go of orthodoxies
Culture Problems causing a long term issue.
Seems to be losing direction on how best to manage growth and traditional cash cow
Employees are not treated with respect. Too many priorities that constantly change.
1. Limited Career Growth in Certain Roles 2. Too many Organizational Changes.
Stupid managers are always promoted.
Focused on cloud sales but not compensated for selling cloud - misalignment between where you focus and how you get measured.
Not vey fast paced. May not pay as much as Meta or Google.
lack of processes and multiple or changes
Management Culture Direction Comp Plan Account mapping
Sometimes leadership does not seem confident in movement from top to bottom
PTO is a bit old school and not as competitive as other companies
Product leaders do not consider UX as an equal owner when it comes to service design
Due to the economic downturn, the travel budget is cut. Wish I had the opportunity to meet my team mates.
Disorganized leadership with constant reshuffling.
Old tech stack. No opportunity to work on modern tech stack.
Alignment at the executive level is confusing.

Alignment at the executive level is confusing.
Pay is less than some other companies
you could get laid off, if the company is losing money
Lots of layoffs happen often
- Lack of young engineers
Annual layoffs at end or at beginning of fiscal year, little information on why. Big company, many layers of management.
Lost it's direction on what it's selling Commission structures are wacky Watch your back.
slow-growing company and fewer opportunities
Senior management seemed to be in continuous struggle over strategic direction and product strategy.
Slow paced, legacy systems, other than that great!
None I loved every day at NetApp.
My time ended then I moved to the next city because of family matters
Management lacks direction or ability to make changes to tools or direction of the company
Difficult to get promoted through the company.
Not experience anything till now
Recent lay-offs and shift in business direction has weakened morale
Frequent layoffs. I mean I hate the fact that the CEO is not at all positive in any of the town halls.
Can't think of any cons.
Working long hours is standard
Nothing bad to say about the company
Dealing with a lot of the issues facing big tech companies these days.
Can be siloed at times
I didn't experience any to be honest.
Has gotten a little swollen, need to trim the fat.
unstable environment and corporate swings
has to deal with a lot of legacy issues
Old company, cultural stagnation, navigating transition from the on prem world
Lost it's direction on what it's selling Commission structures are wacky Watch your back.
Company feels like it needs to decide what it wants to be.
Lack of long term (5+ years) focus
Recent restructuring may impact longer term goals Periodic restructuring is way of life
Training and onboarding went really fast. Could have used a few extra months.
Over the last two years we have had a lot of development of products, and also a lot of acquisitions. Unfortunately with COVID, we have moved our annual Insight Conference virtual, which makes it really hard to truly learn the new stuff we are doing. Sure, I can speak to it, but I am not as competent to get online and actually build out a customer's CVO instance like I can do with their traditional on-premises flash array / SSD systems. I think it is a curse across all of the IT industry, but we do need a chance to just ""stop"" the selling motion and get in and get our hands dirty with some in-person training.
It can be really competitive in a fun way
New management not competent. Thinks everything is textbook and academic. Wants things done the way they want it or nothing.
- Upper level management is not strong - No understanding of individual contributors roles and responsibilities
The company is always changing and adapting, if change is hard for you, this might not be the ideal company. They seem to make some really bad senior executive hires. A handful of really bad , know nothing, and do nothing VPs.
None that I would like to mention
Base comp could use some restructure
Slight Office politics is there. Being the manager’s favorite helps.
Old tech stack May not get to work on cutting edge stuff
A lot of people are doing nothing and getting paid for it. Very hard to get fired unless they're doing layoffs.
Frequent layoffs. I mean I hate the fact that the CEO is not at all positive in any of the town halls.
Day job can be repetitive.
Like all corporations upper management leaves a lot to be desired.
Onboarding is lacking, not the greatest
Layoffs, strategic product shifts, executive management invests then divests, sometimes impacting career growth options. Executive management stratospherically disconnected from first line management.
It seems that there are multiple cultures depending on the team you work in.

Company was built on outdated tech. Very hard for them to pivot to something sustainable.
None that I can think of
Not FAANG RSUs Old School
- Pay is bad - Benefits bad - Work is so unfulfilling - Use the worst tools ever - No career growth is you stay long
Laid off 8% of staff at start of 2023
Lots of firing and layoffs in the name of company reorg.
pathetic leadership that lies through their teeth layoffs that target mostly US teams no clarity of vision lot of vps and directors running their own feudal empire with in the company lot of politics no value for engineering craftsmanship or rigor
Occasional layoffs Sometimes goals are unclear
They took the shutdowns away and layoffs just occurred.
-Not going anywhere -Can only envision more layoffs
Siloed departments and lack of communication between business units
Provided laptops are a nightmare to navigate when you’re a Mac user… wasted so much valuable time troubleshooting.
No Office in Los Angeles

Low pay salary. And experience gap between employees.

","- Plenty of people who are just present in the office but not really contribute and are not kicked out/let go. - Compensation is generally always 1-2 year behind the market. After every wage increase you will feel that the market is still way ahead. - After a certain level, you get stuck with the salary, as from global perspective Hungary is a low cost location. - There are bad / incompetent managers who are also not kicked off, especially if they are since a long time with the company.
Depends on team management and team configuration
HR lied during the job interview basically. Told them I don't want to work in a workplace where it's common to force poeple to do overtime or weekend work, where there is a toxin customer-and internal environment-, and where people are considered as tools and not individual humans ,with rights to have a life besides their job. They ensured me with big smiles that none of the above is part of the company culture. Yet from my first workday basically, it is the case. Overstressed and overloaded teams, and the managment does not care. But they expect you to deliver all projects and fulfill all irrealistic deadlines for customers. Internal colleagues and project team managers are also the embodyments of toxic people at the workplace, constantly ""escalating"" on other Bosch members just to look powerful and hide their own incompetencies. Will not stay here for long
The Romanian branch has the inferiority complex when Germans come in. Too many meetings.
Base Salary could be higher, it is on the lower end of big company salaries in HU.
Might have slow process when it comes to hr
This company is very good for beginning and closer to retirement
Low salary. Yearly salary increasing is low
Nothing as of now I can say
No cons, everything is fine here

The city where I work is quiet and relaxed. It might be not great if you like busy and big cities. From that perspective, the best you can get is Stuttgart.

Some Bad teams in departments there
internal tools only used for development
internal tools only used for development
No cons for me. all good
Low salary. Yearly salary increasing is low
Overtime, management organizational structure and accountability
As compared to Robert Bosch in India Germany Robert Bosch is very better for their work life balance.
Somewhat slow decision practices (very corporate like)
No cons, everything is fine here
7 days a week 12 hour days
I found no cons working there
not much really, i really like working here
Very few women and/or foreigners in leadership position
Depending on the office you work in the culture might be unwelcoming, have a good ol' boys' club, or boys' treehouse mentality. Workplace bullying is not out of the question... and it might not even be from your own manager or people on your team. Bosch seems too large to be able to address this aggressively, and some mangers are too important as far as the business is concerned. If you start your career here you will always wonder if other companies had better learning environments for bringing entry level people up to speed or if they just couldn't find someone with 10+ years experience, you will also always wonder if your career and market value is stagnating and the only place you'll be able to work at in 5 years is Bosch because the practices and technology is so outdated. You'll wonder if you and your team are in a long process of digging yourself out of a hole of technical debt, then you'll start to realize your situation resembles the myth of Sisyphus.
- you have to work in shifts - I don t agree with the boss the failure and quality technicians have, the shift leader, in my opinion another person more qualified in the technical/ quality field should be our leader
Salary is very low compared to other sites
-Huge pressure from upper management to always carry out more then what is said (be proactive) -Climbing the ladder and promotion can be little to none in some departments -Little wage raises, benefits started to drop recently -Very high workload and stress in some departments, overtime can be expected -Poor work-life balance
Salary level could be problem for people who consider working at Bosch.
Traditional mindset of senior management Lack of opportunities for growth at senior levels
Not so much happening in Feuerbach
Hard to change the current policy
Too much documentation needs to be done on a frequent basis.
Awful career progression. Really bad managers. Lack of senior developers because most of them leave the company.
- Salaries below market level (in 2020) - Not particularly developer oriented
No bad stuff good company
No cons for me. all good
Overtime, management organizational structure and accountability
Career progression and increment limited
no specific cons at the moment
The work is too easy. Lazy people are allowed to do nothing. Weak management. Too easy to get hired. No checking qualifications
Canteen could be improved. For me that's quality of life
As compared to Robert Bosch in India Germany Robert Bosch is very better for their work life balance.
Change of work is difficult
Team management is not as per standard
No cons from my side
- corporate hell - complete lack of privacy (open space with the boss in proximity, always) - lack of autonomy (tools are dictated by the architect, always) - lack of room for exploration/POC-ing tech - corporate-speak and lack of office cohesion (gossip is wild-spread, cutthroat behaviour from colleagues) - preferential treatment from the boss from one employee to another - salaries to a fraction of the market in spite of boasted profits - hours spent on the office are precisely counted with punch-cards
Your colleagues are so busy that sometimes you don't get help
Old Management mindset, manager and not developer driven company
No cons - they should have provided work rather than food
Overtime work, bu you can mannage
Since it's a corporate company, sometimes it could be hard to use your imagination because of rules etc.
So far there is none
salary not ok overtime work
the work is very repetitive
Work politics is seen in bosch
Flat organization, average pay and top-down decision making
Nothing for this position also
Nothing to say much about this Gggh
Difficult management Business is shrinking / struggling Lots of bureaucracy
HR takes too long to decide if you're going to get a promotion.
Awful career progression. Really bad managers. Lack of senior developers because most of them leave the company.

Slow in taking decisions, it takes more time.

- The factory is located far from the city Cluj-Napoca. They are offering transport buses but because of the traffic you spend like ~ 50 minutes on a single trip; - Small chances of getting approval for remote working days.
So far there is none
Remote work wasn't really allowed from other countries.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Emerson-Reviews-E225.htm,"Work life balance. Competitive pay.
Flexibility and growth opportunities with many great benefits.
Pay is alright, facilities are very up to date and well kept, benefits (medical, life, etc) are pretty good. The best perk is the insanely high profit share into your retirement account. I also like to see Emerson at least trying to help with diversity in STEM fields. Lots of room available at the company for growth, whether it be staying on your current track or moving into a different area.
Work/Life Balance Explore different areas Fun events
Close interaction with coworkers Good middle-management Focus on improving culture
Culture has improved drastically over 10 years. Management trusts their employees and generally adheres/actions complaints and concerns. Most departments are cordial with one another. Even the dynamic between the union workers and salaried is one of mutual respect and cooperation. Plenty of opportunities to move up in the organization if that’s your thing.
Very good culture at the corporate level Fair pay with good benefits Good HR support
Very big company recognized world wide. Doors are open with any customer.
Flexible schedule for time off when needed, a lot of OT when it comes around, OT is not mandatory, people are great to work with, get recognition when pointing out safety hazards/helping others.
Uppers understand if there are difficulties that come unexpectedly and will assist if needed. Colleagues are extremely helpful amongst each other and will assist with daily tasks in immediate fashion.

They have a nice office environment
Good work life balance but just started so who knows
Benefits were exceptional as well as pay.
Pay arrived on schedule bimonthly
Since it’s such a large company, it’s a great place to learn about corporate engineering and develop connections.
talented people in certain positions
Great Salary Considerate CEO Busy and Growing Committed to a better future for everyone
Good employees hard working and dedicated to this company and the work the operation has gotten better due to the Plant Manager 🙌 🎉 work is not hard it has emproved.
","No Cons that I can think of.
I don't have any cons at this time.
It would have been nice to know during the interview process that the work from home benefit was mostly a sham and is beholden to the whims of your manager entirely. Also there's no real evidence that Emerson is helping with the transition away from fossil fuels outside the company as most development in the group I'm part of is going straight into the hydrocarbon industry that's destroying the planet. The CEO's moves to divest from portions of the business that don't support the ""core"" is also alarming.
Less than competitive compensation for some positions
Raises are nearly non-existent You have to apply for and switch jobs within the company if you want a promotion The company isn’t really run like most large corporate companies, which causes issues with HR and Cross-departmental functions
Pay increases, while annually consistent, are typically at/below inflation. You’re seldomly awarded for staying at one position for very long, which is common in this industry. Definitely have to jump around a bit to make progress salary-wise. Insurance is bottom-barrel. It’s insurance… just expect to pay a high monthly premium while also having to hit a high deductible threshold before insurance starts paying anything. No bonuses… ever.
Too demanding KPI's, causing pressures among peers Not every manager can absorb and implement corporate's culture
Most hated competitor. Hard to get promoted.
Moving up can be difficult without a degree or the necessary requirements.
Work can easily take over past closing business. It can be challenging to find leisure time as things like data acquisition can easily take hours to fully analysis and give some type of conclusive answer.
Pay isn't as good as it could be
Low payment and non-existent HR so problems are not readily solved.
Levels of Bureaucracy Communication not consistent
SOPs need revamp, pay could be better, org changes are frequent
I had no negative experiences during my co-op.
Long and time consuming process to get any decisions/approvals through Difficulty with change management and integration of improvement processes
Need better communication between teams
Top big for the average employee to not be lost. Promotions weren’t applied with merit and raises were abysmal.
Unfortunately I was there during COVID. I am sure it would have been better
Knowingly pay employees below market average while expecting them to perform above average.
This is an engineering company so everything is done very slowly.
Pays is ok, not great
Must be able to work in an ambiguous environment
management needs a lot of work
Hard to move up Pay is Low
Large company so moves slowly, pay is lower tier
Slow to adopt technology and significantly risk averse. Recent CEO change has resulted in very noticeable leftward political shift in culture such as embracing a full slate of DE&I initiatives.
Hard to move up if you don’t know someone or put yourself out there.
not a huge diversity of employees
No flexibility, no remote work, a few managers use micromanagement.
Compensation Benefits Leadership can be questionable at times
Favoritism, drama environment and micro management
HMO is not Premium as of this writing.
Not many things are bad.
The old guard is mired in the past. Biggest issue for them is time card punches. And during covid employees were told to sit six feet apart in the lunchroom and face the front! We're grown people and they're telling us we have to face the front. Not allowed to punch out for lunch, so you are stuck in the building. Covid ran rampant through the place. Worked there 2 years as a temp. Finally had to bring up some health issues and the fact that I needed health insurance so could they hire me? I applied for 3 positions. They couldn't do it. Layed me off! They hired people off the street instead of the guy thats been working for them for two years. An HR manager stood up in one meeting and proclaimed ""There is no expectation of privacy"" . That meant in the building for sure and in your private life. Theyd spy on your private life and then complain about it by walking by you and making comments. They pushed the vaccine. They would stage stupid events like parade an attractive office girl by you and then have someone glare at you, like it was supposed to make you feel guilty. Did the same thing with a really loud buzzer. Had me work in a really tight area with a lady. Set off the buzzer and it scared both of us. It damaged my nerves. 100db im guessing. Abusive. They collude with the police. They will have the police follow you around at lunch or for a few days if they fired you . They had a parking lot security guy for one day once because they let some guy go. They withhold the things you need to advance. Better tools, experience in different areas, keep you out of meetings, etc.
a lot of work but it is worth it
Base pay for interns is $21, Relocation stipend $1000 per month
dont like making big changes
salary's are lagging behind inflation
People when I was there wasn’t very friendly

Base salary could be better compared to competitors or others in the field
Lack of Communication, low Salary, few opportunities for addvancement
Travel. Lower pay due to company truck.
Business Systems Out of Date Sales Channel
None I can think of.
Software is kind of outdated.
People when I was there wasn’t very friendly
Too much Politics and layers
Nothing I can think of
Salary is lower than the average however they are working on raising it.
Work not always linear in nature
Career Growth and compensation not a industry level
Moved everything out of the USA, I think.
They don't pay as well as some other places.
No clear vision for the future, just ideas that are rarely executed because of the unorganized nature of the company.
-- No real innovation. Emerson tech improvement is based on acquiring smaller companies, which leads to a rather fragmented organization and a dysfunctional software ecosystem. -- Diversity could be better. They do have some ERG programs in place, and a ""Chief People Officer"" but in reality, there is not much done to promote and encourage diversity. - Number of years with the company is the first criteria to get promoted as manager or executive. You have to start young with Emerson, and get detected and placed in their internal Leadership program to get a chance to become an exec or a VP someday. If you join them at mid-career level, you will remain at the same position for years, no matter how well you perform. - Rigid management, with an ""even keel"" mindset.
stagnant role and evaluation per annum doesn't really have a good reflection on pay raise
Not really have any cons
Takes a little to get the hang of
Salary not competitive to other companies mostly when you do not have experience in the same industry and it's your first time qorking for this field.
Legacy company values, revenue is based on Oil and Gas, the parking lot is segregated based on work experience. No consistency in the organization, each group in the organization will use different proprietary tools, processes, file sharing tools, etc. For source control, some groups will use GitLab, others TFS, other ClearCase, others GitHub, others Azure. For messaging, some groups use Teams, some Webex, others email. For document storage, some teams store docs in teams others in SharePoint others in ClearCase. If you don't have someone to ask, you won't be able to find documentation on your own. All of these decisions seem to be arbitrary and lead to confusion and lack of collaboration. The DEI agenda pushed from the top down seems solely for publicity. The department Oil and Gas was re-branded to Energy and Transportation, but nothing in that business model has changed.
None known as of now.
Salary could be better and more card vending machines
Went from a small company to a large corporation,
A large company, so expect team and division communications to breakdown.
The tacos are tiny and the afternoon snack isn't healthy.
Repetitive. Rote. Robotic work. Boring
-Automation technology is not cutting edge compared to modern tech companies -Growth based on project tasks which could take longer than expected to happen
Some people in management have no business managing people. They have just been working for the company for 30 years and get thrown into management.
No growth opportunities and no appreciation for hard work. Promotions are given based on amount of talk, not actual results.
Very rigid in thinking and reacting
Legacy business units are being sold off. Only time will tell how good these recent movers are.
Boring, corporate, inconsequential, not a lot of fun
Pay is lower than average. There is lot of middle management.
Very disconnected organization. They acquire new businesses so rapidly and don’t spend enough time on boarding and integrating their acquisitions. I was hired as an Emerson employee at a location that had only been part of Emerson for one year before I joined. It was nearly impossible to integrate into the Emerson culture and I was stuck working in the toxic culture left over from the former company. Within the business I was working, it was almost celebrated to work around the clock and to work during your time off (very unhealthy). Also, when I tried exploring career advancement opportunities, I was accused of trying to jump ship. As a person who is goal and development oriented, this was very discouraging.
Communication between areas of responsiblity could be improved on,
Slow career progression Less experienced people on Management positions Old offices
With great success comes an unwillingness to change quickly to meet market demand. ""We've done it this way for years, why change"" mentality (though this can be changed with effort). HR does not hire on a timely basis leading to much more responsibility without compensation. Huge fear of getting stuck in a certain role (and flatline compensation) leads people to constantly moving to other departments in the org looking for higher pay. Disorganization in how CAD files are kept, how legacy products were designed/ used Engineering support tons of legacy products Completely outdated ERP system that is in process of changing (but there will be headaches for the next year of changeover)
Repetitive. Rote. Robotic work. Boring
Tendency to outsource most work to low cost labor countries.
-Automation technology is not cutting edge compared to modern tech companies -Growth based on project tasks which could take longer than expected to happen
Company as a whole didn't manage performance, but preferred to move poor performers into other roles. In my experience at Emerson if you are a top-performer you are over used and they try to squeeze as much out of you as they can which led to burn-out. That approach combined with lack of overall performance management allowed poor performers to remain employed while top-performers left the company.
Constant microaggressions, management taking credit for work their teams completed, no plans to advance the company, just a push to do more with less year after year
Legacy business units are being sold off. Only time will tell how good these recent movers are.
Boring, corporate, inconsequential, not a lot of fun
Politics are very very bad
Communication between areas of responsiblity could be improved on,
Feels much like a Wall-Street ran business
Lack of any kind of inspiration. It’s a job and that’s it.
Need to clock overtime daily
The unpaid lunch kinda sucks
None that I have to share
Forgotten if aquired by buy out
The size of the company also means it can be difficult to get ideas up and running. There is a lot of passing of responsibilities to and from different groups and certain projects will just be left in limbo.
lost in a transition to IT and losing their edge in manufacturing. morale and culture are damage with new leadership in place
Managers are trained to engage with their employees, but sometimes it is forced and comes across as disingenuous.
Management: Supervisor she's late every day and lazy talks on the phone making personal calls and she won't help when the work is backup how could she get paid to come to work and set down all day and facetime while the other supervisors work they butts off unfair to me. Operation Manager: She picks with certain employees while other employees get away breaking the rules. And she she shows a lot of favoritism towards the employees and can be harsh at time not open to any ideas or thing you propose. As for ideas about work procedures or ways we can make our work place fun but workful at the same time. She is closed out and will not deal with the employees on that note. She only wanna put you down and picks with employees iv never seen her work well with any employees there.

Company has some good policy
Good benefits and some bonuses
","Base pay at time may not seem very competitive. Locations
1. Promotion after Labor Grade 7 becomes a matter of who you know. 2. Nepotism is very rife. I once worked at a location in which a daughter-in-law was sitting less than 10 feet away from the father-in-law. 3. Husband and wife in Supply Management sitting in the same office 4. POLITICS! POLITICS!! POLITICS!!! 5. Not a great place to stay for long otherwise you will be staring at retirement by the time you can get opportunity to get to certain Labor Grades. Within 3 years of my departure from Deere, my salary has grown by nearly 60K!!! 6. TOXIC environment in which you are just a number of you don't know the right people. 7. Lots of informants who go from person to person, seeking incriminating information to present to their godfathers for someone to be NAILED! 8. Disappearing benefits.
You can change a system that improves a product globally that the business units praise. Then the organization doesn't recognize it. Probably because leadership stole the credit. They refuse to send you to further education. (in my expirience), and give you a 3% raise. They also are getting rid of bonuses it looks like since they have record profit and say that they didn't make enough money to give you a propper bonus.
Growth is little slower in terms of promotions
Little room for professional growth (promotions) in environmental department without relocating.
The very same rules and regulations can become bureaucratic nightmare in getting things done.
No career advancement for a while
Promotions takes forever, after certain level not much chnaces to get promoted
Software is newish to John Deere
I don't have any cons

Lacking in qualified techs./nation wide as an industry. This puts a lot more work/pressure on current in field techs.
If you work on the factory floor there are times that the demand can be high. Be prepared to work extra hours if production is behind.
A lot of standing. Fast paced
The very same rules and regulations can become bureaucratic nightmare in getting things done.
Large Company: It can take a long time to get something done. Sometimes there are many teams involved to do something that seems simple.
One of the downsides is that my computer doesn’t work sometimes but this isn’t a big issue.
Promotions takes forever, after certain level not much chnaces to get promoted
low pay, not much room for advancement, minimal training opportunities
Creativity is encouraged but can be limited by corporate guidelines at times.
I don't have any cons
Long hours, they only hire managers from outside which are hit or miss
Culture can be toxic depending on which team you are on. Pay could be better. No fully remote working options. Would have to move to a Moline, Illinois in order to move up the ladder. Which no one wants to do lol.
Work load is tense. Must be willing to take the extra step
It's career growing and splendid
Location technical scope growth learning
Being mostly in IA, not beat for young
everything else is not as good as other companys
The location is in a remote town
I don't have any cons
Too much emphasis on DEI. Starting to feel like another American company gone woke.
Hard to up your salary unless you hop to a new internal position
Work is not very challenging sometimes
Long hours, behind times with technology
Nepotism plays a big role in filling job roles. Value experience far more than education. Manager’s opinions are emphasized higher than your own experience when applying. Turnover is high from employees becoming burnt out from wearing more than one hat. Gaslight employees into doing work out of your scope to get higher performance ratings. No accountability for bad managers, so people quiet quit for better managers. If you don’t fit into the toxic work culture, you will stand out. Even though they have DEI and safe space trainings, you are not valued if you go against the grain. Very hard to collaborate with arrogant one track minded engineers who never had to compromise. Operations runs very poorly and is the biggest inefficiency of the business while they shrink capital for new equipment. Only some managers knew how to manage people while most were incompetent and were milquetoast puppets.
Difficult to navigate in a large old and established company.
little less salaries than outside tech market
Location could be a bit better
No cons at all good
You can be overworked depending on the team.
Work can be repetitive SAP

Environment is constantly changing which make it difficult
Ageism is rampant Push employees are the most important asset & then layoff employees Friends and family are hired and promoted over more qualified individuals Managers are threatened by employees that are smart & talents, will stall your career
Location at Moline may be depressing due to climate
Bad group, 5 work minimum
Lots of rules/regulations to follow. Procedural overload.
idk boring work place so thats life
Communication with my boss was not the greatest
I didn't like it very much
- Hard to move up after a certain level - Low compensation
Vacation days take a long time to accrue to the point where it’s similar to data science positions at other companies.
Management likes is not held accountable nor are the employees.
Limited growth opportunities unless diverse
Need more paid time off
No carry over PTO's. If you are an immigrant and wanted to visit your family abroad it would be harder as you cannot WFH. Although you are good to use PTO during the time at abroad as there are less PTOs and no carry over you can barely spend time to visit your family. You better talk to HR on this before you join the company.
Very tactical role. You will be working on factory floor.
Limited growth opportunities specially in the core mechanical engineering domain
New Manager and Org Changes pretty much every two years. Good Ole Boy Management. Managers are not Leaders. Pay Raises don't keep up with inflation. Little room for career growth at higher levels.

company policy has been deteriorating day by day. now they have remove the policy of WFH that is the worst part. earlier they called 1 day a week now they are forcing everyone to come, people in Chicago stay far from office even then also they are forcing people to join office, no work life balance now in John Deere Chicago office.
Depending on the time of the year you may be over worked or under worked.

Your career means something to management because its philosophy is individual's make the whole what it is. I will never regret leaving where I came from to be a part of this amazing company.
Great culture and some of the best benefits in the world.
1. A very diverse culture. 2. The PTO, benefits and salaries are very competitive. 3. They are a very innovative company taking your ideas and bringing them to fruition. 4. Lots of room for advancement, and managers are very supportive of development. 5. Lots of great opportunities for giving back to the community, surrounding areas and all over the world. 6. Flexible work schedules and work from home or anywhere options. I work from home several days a week, I am saving so much on gas and wear and tear on my car. Also, WFH helps with work life balance I am home when I could be sitting in traffic.
Mastercard is a stable company that treats their employees well - incredible 401k match and there are many smart people that work here. Recognizable name for resume and a good place to start your career
1. They treat you like adults. 2. The diverse culture is POSITIVE! You never hear that someone doesn't want to work today. The paid time off benefits are superlative.

The benefits were amazing and easy to use
Benefits Flexible schedule Hybrid in office/ work from home Great values & culture Advancement opportunities Supportive leadership committed to developing employees
Mastercard’s benefits, opportunities to advance, ability to be flexible to employee needs, focus on implementing new technologies, and the strong product focus makes working at the company enjoyable and keeps things interesting. It’s a great way to learn and advance. I was there for 8 years in various roles. I enjoyed the vision and culture under Ajay Banga’s leadership greatly, and was sad to see him leave.
Very smart employees to work with and learn from.
Policies and departments are good
The aim is to bring data processing and storage closer to the place of data creation in order process the large data load as quickly as possible and to get latency problems under control. Edge computing is often the prerequisite for applications to be provide data in real time at ant given location. Instead of relying on a central cloud data center, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, companies want to process locally generated mass data. Such as those generated by mobile devices or the often-countless machines integrated into an lot network, on site. In combination with 5G mobile communications and wifi-6 networks, edge computing enables fast on-site processing. With Next Edge, Mastercard is responding to this trend and has developed and event- driven framework that can handle workloads at the edge.

Well run company, smart people, very complex and technical problems to solve.
Work remotely is great for this company
Mastercard is one of the great place to work. They have excellent life and work balance, helpful environment and lots resources to learn and grow continuously. I have only positive feedback to share about company and environment during 1.5 years of being full-time employee for Mastercard.
There is a drive to improve documentation that is already pretty good. You can improve your skills online. Great mental health support. A week of volunteer time off, PTO, four weeks of vacation. The Cafe is great. Regular demos to learn what other teams are doing. It is a very supportive team environment.
Very collegial environment with smart colleagues

Mastercard's culture is very strong. The people are nice. The work is interesting. And the opportunities to grow, learn and develop are findable at every level. Employees are encouraged to take ownership of work & are rewarded fairly. The employee benefits are also great. On the lighter side, it's also fun when our ambassadors and outside experts engage with us in the office.

Mastercard cares about its employees. They actually listen to each of us no matter what position someone holds. Your career means something to management because its philosophy is individual's make the whole what it is. I will never regret leaving where I came from to be a part of this amazing company.
Great Company to work for. Speaking for my team, really supportive people who don’t make you feel as if you’re bothering them. Came in as an intern like many others there as well. Great work life balance as well, rarely will my team have to stay on past usual working hours.
Great culture and great benefits.

","I don't have anything but good things to say about Mastercard.
Lower pay than some top tech companies but better than average by a good margin.
No cons in the 15 years I’ve worked here, MC has been amazing to me, hoping for another 15.
There are essentially two groups at Mastercard - the folks who value stability and are lifers and those who join after buying the positioning of MA being an innovative company and leave within 3 years. In my experience, if you are looking to be inspired it will be hard to find within the EVP leadership team who are political and not strategic thinkers. Constant priority churn to try to meet short term revenue targets and try to make ROI from the train wreck of acquisitions done over the course of the last few years, a complete lack of vision in what should be the more innovative teams, silos abound as does busywork and inside out thinking, and despite talk of transparency and working together there is little to no leadership to fulfill that vision - but plenty of name dropping of who talked to the CEO or last. Very slow moving technology process that will drive anyone coming from an actual agile organization mad and severely outdated business processes that will be unrecognizable for anyone coming from a high growth SAAS company
You'll never want to leave. The flexible hours and flexible work from home option will make you work more. You'll WANT to, because Mastercard is so good to you.
What you’d expect from a large corporation. Benefits progressively decline over time.
Fully remote all the time isn’t ideal
Work load varies depending on which team you are on, some teams stay more busy than others.
The cons of working at Mastercard are the politics and bureaucracy in the Operations, Networking , and Employee Digital Experience (ONE) organization. The ONE organization has poor executive leadership that has a culture of nepotism/cliques and corporate bullying. My last few months, people who reported misconduct or disagreed with the CTO were put on a list and their jobs eliminated. Don’t report anything to HR or ethics - they are not your friend. There is a lack of training, and when large transformation efforts are rolled out, people are expected to learn on their own - they roll things out or start initiatives without much consideration for adoption and change management with their employees. I self taught and spent time trying to educate senior leadership to understand the impact - they expect a check mark and don’t really value the mindset of exemplifying change from the top. There is no work-life balance - I was working between 60-80 hours and wearing multiple hats. When I spoke up, and set boundaries, my manager’s behavior changed and I felt I had a target on my back in every meeting. There is a strong lack of company appreciation around employees. Some managers are good at recognition, but most not so much, especially senior leaders. There is a strong focus on meeting objectives without regard and reward for people going the extra mile. There is a lack of accountability culture, and when you hold peers accountable for the responsibility they signed up, they get offended and hate you. Coworkers like to throw people under the bus, and if you are a manager don’t share anything with your peers or direct reports - there is a gossip culture and people will do anything to get ahead. For women in tech, if you are assertive and just doing your job, good luck advancing as you will be painted like a villain while your male colleagues can get away with unprofessional behavior.
Opportunities to advance hard to come by. Too many VP’s.
Work-Life balance. Management Maturity level.
There is no cons on my side
Fully remote all the time isn’t ideal
Lot of non technical people driving technical departments leading to bureaucracy and cost New leadership trying to making changes towards a more technology company but change is too slow due to fore-mentioned reassigns Management positions often filled with not technical leaders with good people skills leading to cost overruns and lack of accountability
Work load varies depending on which team you are on, some teams stay more busy than others.
While there are many advantages to working at MasterCard, it's important to consider some potential drawbacks as well. One potential con could be the fast-paced and demanding nature of the financial industry, which may require high levels of dedication and commitment. Additionally, like any large organization, there may be some hierarchical structures that could impact decision-making or hinder flexibility. Lastly, the global nature of MasterCard's operations may involve occasional travel or working across different time zones, which could potentially pose challenges for work-life balance. These cons may vary depending on individual preferences and priorities.
Developer tools bad, pay under market value, can't retain good talent
Increasing salaries to meet tech industry standards
Like every large corporation: lot's of politics
Getting the appropriate help from coworkers for getting job done on time
Honestly, I don't have anything to share about Cons. If you able to put enough effort for your work and do your job with passion everyone is ready to help you.
Contract employees are excluded from some on-site perks. Executives are paid many times what most employees are paid which contributes to income inequality.
Too much stasis at times for innovation
There is no cons on my side
No big cons; there is a strong culture of fairness which permeates throughout most choices in the org.
Large company atmosphere with 30,000 employees
Bureaucracy, slow processes, hard to be efficient

Developer tools bad, pay under market value, can't retain good talent
Bureaucracy and red tape - making simple things tough to accomplish, lack of ownership for certain programs/processes, need for either a PPO health plan or more HSA funding to subsidize the health plan offerings.
Very few cons to speak of but at the ground-level, there is not a good process for data-driven decision-making and it is often difficult to get what should be basic information on KPIs from the technical teams that would support these decisions. A model-based problem solving training would be very valuable.
none as of now. all good.
The only downside is that I didn't get to Mastercard sooner!
Big company so it is often hard to get something new started without clear exec backing. Financial so many security restrictions make it hard to try new things Sometimes difficult to get other groups interested in the projects i need from them
-Workload as any other company
Like every large corporation: lot's of politics
Onboarding was a bit chaotic. I had to take the initiative to find information on my own. Not a lot of hand holding. MANY acronyms to learn, and due to the size of the organization and its structure, it takes time to learn the role well.
As always, a couple bad apples in management Inflation has taken a hit to the pay
Tries to move fast but like most big companies struggles with doing so.

As usual there's politics involved in higher management which affects you as well.
-Workload as any other company
depend on team, some are busy
Ok the bad. While this is a great place to work over time the amount of bureaucracy just gets tiring. The way this place is organized is just insane with every group doing its own thing and every group having different rules to engage them. More than once I'd have a product ready but it could take months to get time from other teams to do their parts all the while I'm sitting in my status meeting rehashing the same stuff. waiting. Next, they are in a terrible position of trying to embrace modern processes for IT but desperately clinging to old processes that should have been let go years ago. They do innovate but also horde every legacy idea and it's a maze trying to wind through all that. There is also a bad habit of knee-jerk reactions to every little issue. Instead of letting us sit down and build a solution we were constantly tasked with patching up or slapping on another monitoring tool. And that comment about management welcoming your thoughts from the Pros? The line managers do but while you are entering it into the backlog they also will tell you it's going to sit there for years.
Mid-level leaders only give lip service to DEI and forget the ""I"" is for inclusivity (particularly regarding gender and age). Too many fiefdoms are allowed to exist.

I don't have anything but good things to say about Mastercard.
Not any serious cons. The only thing I can think of that affects my role is budget cuts , which make it harder to set and meet quarterly goals.
extended hiring freeze causing promotions to be delayed
Have to go in the office
no cons uptil now everything is good
Management can't seem to figure out how to manage for results vs. inputs.
The process is a bit slow
Outsourcing and departments being too stretched out.
Typical big company issues - slow to adopt new technologies, etc. Quality of team depends where you land
Sometimes there's an attitude of ""do this for a nameless executive now"" despite how busy you are. Some regions are less easy to work with than others.
- None to list at the moment!
Large company means significant process and bureaucracy
No cons that I can think of
- The base pay is not the best compared to FAANG - Healthplan has high deductibles (but there's a $850 HSA contribution by the company) - For those below VP, the stock incentives are limited. - Tuition reimbursement is only $11,000 - hoping they increase it!
Hard to get promotions, some teams not well managed, hours sometimes long.

MasterCard can be hard to understand, make an entrance into the company.
Largely matrixed organization where it is hard to navigate. There are people that are lifetimers (have been there for many years) and are 'stuck in their ways' so it is hard to change the culture and 'way of doing things'

Treat you right & give you tons of perks
Company culture is excellent. I feel well supported not only by management but also by my team. There is so much to learn and I feel that Indeed provides you with all the tools to help you improve your performance. Everyone is so nice/friendly and also professional. The offices are beautiful. Lunch is served on the days we are required to come in (Tues/Wed). Monthly (happy hour) socials and fun events are curated by our Employee Experience team. We also get 1 company-wide Friday off per month.
You are paid well if you get lucky with your book of business . Unlimited PTO. If you have a good manager it can be an amazing experience.
Pay is great when promoted to senior, company culture is great, and management rep relationships are on a human level.
Indeed is a very employee-centric company, making it wonderful to be employed there. I worked at Indeed for 4 years until I was laid off in 2023 with 15% of the employee base globally. As a PMO professional, there are a huge number of opportunities to lead complex, global initiatives with strategic value. RSU grants, ""You Days"" and open PTO are all real pros of working here. Also a huge pro is Indeed's position on DEIB and ""bringing your whole self to work"" - they really walk that talk. I've never felt so included and able to be myself (queer female w/a disability) as at Indeed.
-Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, Belonging! -Benefits -BEAUTIFUL AUSTIN OFFICE!
Unlimited PTO Co-workers How they handled the initial pandemic
Excellent benefits, mindful co-workers and data-driven culture. Very glad to be with Indeed. It's been a long time since I've worked for such a great company.
super nice people great benefits great PTO policy very nice office
They pay a great salary/bonuses If you're allowed in the office, the food and everything is a great bonus They do a lot to try to build a good culture there, as long as you believe what they do
Pretty good compensation, YOUdays, and remote
Indeed has been a wonderful company with amazing culture but changes with leadership, products, all time low quota attainment (at least in my 4 years) are causing people to leave in droves.
- Great work-life balance - Coworkers and managers are generally great people; very nice, outgoing, etc. - Support for self-driven learning - Mostly solid workers with a few genuinely highly-skilled people. I don't think many people I were truly unqualified/below expectations, maybe 4 or so that I directly interacted with over my 8 years.
It has provided me with opportunities to work with Fortune 500 companies and avenues to travel that I believe I would never have had with another company.
I didn’t have to use the phone every day

* Teammates are outstanding * You are trusted to do your job and treated like an adult * Flexible when you need it
The people (some not all) are great to work with. I am lucky to have the privilege of working with some of the best and brightest minds at the ATL office. I have had nothing but great experiences with my coworkers and colleagues and wouldn't change the majority of it for the world.
Decent pay and wlb here

It was awesome to be working there for the past few years, learned a lot, contributed a lot and had a lot of impacts on people I mentored and folks from other teams, and likewise I learned a lot from a lot of folks there. It was a very nice place to be in, to grow professionally, and to do professional work. My team was awesome and I had the opportunity to go out of my comfort zone and grow my skills in many other areas to support my team. Everyone respected everyone there, and I was fortunate to have never come across anyone who was disrespectful and mean.
Flexible work environment Mission-oriented Good pay Great benefits
friendly work environment great benefits room for growth and advancement
I had the pleasure of working at Indeed for a year and I can confidently say that it had one of the best workplace cultures I've experienced. From day one, the team welcomed me with open arms and made sure I felt comfortable in my role. Additionally, there was a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork. Whether it was brainstorming sessions, cross-functional projects, or just grabbing lunch together, everyone was willing to help each other out and work towards a common goal.
I was at Indeed for 8 years until the 2023 lay-offs. I can say, Indeed pre-covid was unlike anything I could ever explain here. It was fun, challenging, transparent, mildly fair quotas. I had a lot of career growth happen over that time.
I feel like my managers have always been supportive and given me a lot of room to learn, grow, and shape the direction of my career. I have never been in a more supportive, open, and receptive environment, and it's great to feel valued and part of the team
Work life balance great here
Great work culture, benefits, and helping clients!

Amazing company with a great culture. Indeed does more for its employees than anyone ive ever seen. PTO and YOU days are incredible and wont see elsewhere. Free lunch in office
Great company, great benefit and room for growth.
The company really cares about you. Even throughout change, leadership is as transparent as they can be. Open PTO. Good development if you are motivated.
work life balance, PTO, flexibility
The people are friendly and work life balance is great
Unlimited PTO You Days Strong Benefits Generally flexible work culture, understanding management Collaborative work environment
Meaningful work and a healthy work environment.
They hire fantastic people because they are (or at least were) competitive with the top tech employers in terms of compensation. You get to work on products that help people get jobs, which is always fulfilling.
Work life balance is good. There are quite a few folks with kids so people respect others' personal life boundaries. Co-workers are friendly. Company has a clear mission with well defined principles SLT seems compassionate and empathetic

All the pros were prior to the layoffs and now -- not so much, but to touch on the pros I'd say: Unlimited PTO One Friday a month mandatory off as well Medical, Dental, and Health Benefits

The talent at Indeed exists primarily in the ICs they've attracted to the company and the overall compensation package they offer.
The people and atmosphere are the best
- Sincere efforts to be fair in hiring and compensation - Great work/life balance - Flexible remote/office/hybrid policies for most positions - Culture of collaboration - For 3 years, it was one of the best jobs I have ever had
Amazing, positive culture Huge market share and scale Supportive executive leadership Ability to learn and grow YOU days
- Flexible PTO and you days - Benefits - WFH
Great product to sell - Stacks up well against competition Open PTO is incredible
Open PTO, a monthly YOU day, 401k with match, and the capacity for a fully remote role, among others. They do well on the superficial stuff.
I specifically meant to say ""be a part of"" instead of ""work for"" because that's how Indeed makes you feel...I've worked for other larger companies and truth be told, they could all learn from Indeed. I have the work-life balance I set out for when I was job hunting and the pay/benefits are fair. I'm very happy here and would recommend it to anyone who is seeking a position in client success!
Love my team and directors
Not a bad experience, would recommend.
Great leadership, progressive company and excellent benefits.
The company really cares about you. Even throughout change, leadership is as transparent as they can be. Open PTO. Good development if you are motivated.
So many great people outside the senior leadership team.
Generally seemed like the company wanted to take care of people and do the right thing.
I really enjoyed my time at Indeed. The culture is one of the best and I always appreciated the work life balance. It's a company where you can enjoy the work that you're doing and remain stress free.
People friendly and good benefits
Great support from leadership and management
Great benefits and work-life balance.
Pay is competitive in some areas Benefits are top notch
I loved working here, the team culture and work-life balance are amazing. While this may be from a product ops perspective, I've connected with several TDMs and Senior EMs who concur with this thought sighting that they don't have rigorous working hours to support on-calls.
Remote work, uses Apple products
Work life Balance. Manager are caring
","No cons for this place
As it gets larger more and more KPI’s to keep hitting
Sales in any company will always have an aspect to it that is stressful. PTO is unlimited but as a sales rep you should be pacing at a good rate towards your quota for you to feel confident in asking for time off. Some of those tougher quarters can begin to feel like burnout because you're afraid take some time off to reset. However the perks at Indeed help lighten the load.
Do not believe what they are selling that they care about you as a person. Indeed only cares about one thing..money. The recent layoffs should be proof of that. For years I was under the belief they cared about employees mental health and then I started to see through it. If you have a bad quarter or two..then you are a liability to the company. Micro management is huge here and they make you hit stupid metrics even if you are pacing to hit your goal. Indeed only surfacely cares about their employees well being but deep down is just like every other corporation where profits are more important than people..and you know it. Yes you make good money here but I was miserable and management was disgusting and played favorites pretty clearly and it really impacts mental health. I make less elsewhere but am much more happy.
Job security is less confident after recent times
Unfortunately, Indeed has a lot trouble getting work ""over the line."" Planning lasts FOREVER and is not effective. Leadership says they prioritize velocity and think planning is largely unnecessary, but they don't understand iterative planning and waste time in the wrong types of planning with the wrong personnel. At least 1 C-level exec dislikes PMO but PMO roles up to her (and she's hired a PMO Director who has no PMO experience). Moreover, leadership gets in the way of competent people doing their jobs. Indeed hires experienced professionals and then put them in a corner to collect dust. Co-workers and I were reprimanded for being overly ""results focused"" and trying to do our jobs in ways that weren't the ""Indeed"" way."" It's sad to see - if you hire rock stars, let them lead and let them do what they do best.
-I have none so far!
Micomanagement Cliquey Now that I've left I realized how underpaid I was
Recently, Indeed has gone through some changes to their business model to be a leaner organization. With that comes growing pains, but the amazing culture is focused on maintaining the open and diverse culture thru these changes.
not the most competitive pay
There are/were very deserving people at this company that were overqualified for a promotion, but were stuck in the same role for 3-5 years without a promotion. Rather than promoting from within to people that had earned it, they hired people externally. They'll do whatever they have to to protect the business. Your loyalty to the company means nothing. You're expendable, and the management team makes that known. You MUST accept what you're being told to do. Not open to other suggestions or possible other ways to complete a task. IMPORTANT: If you lean right politically, you're not really welcome at this company. The CEO doesn't even try to hide it in his regular Q&As with the company. He has a political belief, and you best follow it. They shove political ideology down everybody's throat in the name of diversity and inclusion, but they don't even try to hide the fact that they would rather you be anything other than a straight, white, male.
It is hard to understand why people are Indeed-lifers for a newcomer. In my 7+ years as a PM I have been most unhappy here. People were fine, though culture is not much to write home about. This is a massive company operating soooo slowly. It takes months to get anything done. Folks seem to think scheduling, showing up to meetings and commenting on documents is work. Planning processes are non-existent, deadlines are CRITICAL and then they just move. I saw planning done for a 150+ person group with no plan, no meeting to kick it off, no working backward dates, no tasks really assigned, just 55 people in one document and frantic slacks in 4-5 different channels and then demands about why things weren't done. There is both a sense of urgency and no urgency at the same time. Everyone wants data-driven decisions, in-fact its a core company principal, yet data is constantly a mess and ""unreliable"". I hoped there was a ton of room to improve a fairly bare bones product. However, I now see that there is no innovative product-mindedness or UX-mindedness. All anyone cares about is if there was a Connection, regardless the shoddy experience. Also the review process is a massive time suck. It seems to be changing soon, but really just seems like a way to occupy people for 2-3 weeks since there is nothing else to actually get done. I want to coast like everyone else, but my time might be better spent exiting.
Indeed is forcing clients to change to pay per applicant versus our pay per click pricing model since we can't grow anymore with our current model to make our shareholders happy. Looking to increase the spend per job is making our clients furious and no one wants to listen to feedback. While the spend per job increases, there is less job volume and quotas are created based on pay per click models causing sales to miss consistently. A lot of sales orgs are going through challenges with quota attainment but this seems to be self-inflicted. Indeed is looking at long-term growth but will experience short term struggles and for sales that is concerning. We also lost the face of sales this quarter, our CRO, who has been with Indeed and is ""leaving for another opportunity"" where I believe he sees the writing on the wall like many others. In my opinion, our new pricing model is going to make us the next monster.com since we always listen to jobseeker feedback but not our clients apparently.
- Feels like mid-level management is bloated. - Unclear org structure for most of my tenure. - Data-driven culture seemed to fade away as time went on and we began to be expected to ""find the right numbers"" to support the decision that had already been made. - Career advancement is difficult to work towards in this org because targets/milestones/""next-level behavior"" was very vague and rarely correlated to the work being done on the ground.
Some of the external items are tough but most of all positive and you don't have to deal with it.
The clients can be rude

Low pay and not many opportunities for growth or lateral movement in this specific field
not the most competitive pay
Despite relying on Services and client-facing teams to manage complex relationships between employers and Indeed products, Indeed remains a very product-centric company. Sometimes chaotic and experimental product development without the equal attention to its impact on services, business processes, and client care. This makes for a difficult change management and go-to-market environment for a huge portion of the business. Lack of investment in resilience and incident management means regular fire drills for service teams. Personal experience: 5 different strategic leaders (VP level) and 4 significant re-orgs in 4 years on the delivery side makes it challenging for any strategy to gain traction. Needs leadership focus and advocacy on the service / client-facing side (and CRO just exited 2023), with a balance of product and service thought. Glassdoor is sister company (btw)

Rapid changes to products without much client notification
I joined during a hyper-growth phase and unfortunately all these phases has done is water down the culture and introduce bad practices. What was once an agile, fast moving company has turned into a behemoth without much direction. The influx of additional people during 2018, 2021 have brought their bad practices from other organizations and without strong leadership at Indeed, has given these people free reign to run amok inside of indeed. Inflating their own titles and perform kingdom building. Indeed culture was TOO nice and SLT wouldn't put their foot down and address the problem. Instead they gave toxic people blank checks to go on hiring sprees, duplicating efforts and teams in the process. Some parts of the company are extremely slow moving. I'm talking 1+ month to add a button to a UI. It's laughable it takes that long but I'm not joking. Indeed had a competitive edge at one point, they squandered that lead and now other startups are coming to eat their lunch. I give Indeed 5-10 before they go the way of Monster.com
Despite an alleged culture of inclusion, diversity, etc., politics still play a role in how people are treated. I was a victim of bullying that was supported at levels beyond me. HR did nothing. The policy against retaliation was not only not enforced, it worked in the reverse. I was literally conspired against and forced out by a few jealous employees whose lies were constant and supported by each other, combined with my Senior Director, who was too weak to want to deal with the situation. However, the contributions I made to the organization are still in place and providing value. And, there are people there, that did not feel animosity by my presence, that wish I were still there. A sad loss for us all. I loved my team and our mission.
-constant reorgs -managers/team-leads are the weakest link -some of the tenured employees are not up to speed -lack of transparency regarding raises -limited mobility -can't work remote in most major cities in the US without approval
Aimless direction from Senior Leadership and bad product rollouts over the past 3 years have caused Indeed to rapidly lose business. Indeed did not properly prepare for what it should have seen coming and as a result over hired in a big way. Senior Leadership has made bad decision after bad decision and lays off 2200 people instead of anyone stepping down or being let go at the top levels of the company. Clients will only stick around so long after being let down or mislead several times in a few years.
Salary and pay increases and slim to none - never willing to negotiate wage or raises
-- We need more amazing people here to get 100M jobs :).
Can be a bit overwhelming at times, but my team has always been understanding and supportive
Too many people, it can be complicated to navigate for a new comer
None I can think of
Strict on KPI's, but goals are attainable

A lot of teams, I couldn't meet everyone in the company
-constant reorgs -managers/team-leads are the weakest link -some of the tenured employees are not up to speed -lack of transparency regarding raises -limited mobility -can't work remote in most major cities in the US without approval
- base compensation has space to improve - with economic situation they removed breakfast from the benefits and are exploring to reduce other benefits

-double edge sword.. every week is new so consistency can be challenging -wish we had summer fridays -this role is hybrid so you're in office a few days a week -Diversity is still a struggle
Salary and pay increases and slim to none - never willing to negotiate wage or raises
Strict on KPI's, but goals are attainable
SALARY!! truly underpaid compared to other companies for the same position. Absolutely no opportunity for internal growth/transfer. I feel like being in CS is looked down upon even though you know all product solutions & collaborate with so many teams.
- Lack of accountability at senior management level - Entrepreneurial spirit ... but do what the Business tells you to do - Ineffective hiring policies, inefficient hiring practices - Poor management re: expectations setting for employees, changing dialogue and not showing up / being present once layoffs were announced in March, 2023
A lot of teams, I couldn't meet everyone in the company
* Grew too much until layoffs were required, leaving a lot of amazing people out of work * Some of the recent changes are not super employee friendly
The company laid off 15% of the workforce after reassuring us there would be no company layoffs. They change the metrics that are meant to be hit every quarter. They (being management) will micromanage and nitpick everything. Management will fabricate incidents and then report you to HR and not clarify the situation. I could go on but those are the gripes I have with the company thus far.
No direction from leadership, culture of toxic positivity
- base compensation has space to improve - with economic situation they removed breakfast from the benefits and are exploring to reduce other benefits
Well, bad economy forced Indeed to make a choice to cut off a lot of people (me included), and I wish I was given the choice to stay with reduced pay because I really identified myself as a proud indeedian, but was just let go, unfortunately.
If you get on the CMOs bad side, forget being promoted Too many cooks in the kitchen No autonomy with decision making
things tend to change a lot and can cause frustration
One issue that I encountered was a lack of clear career development paths. While managers were generally supportive of employee growth, there wasn't always a concrete plan in place for advancement.
Indeed has no way for their employees to self-identify if they have a disability. Further, even if people were able to share that info (if they wish to do so), sales managers aren't given the tools to help them manage these individuals.
Changes come quickly and organizational changes aren't always very transparent, so I've found I need to be very flexible and go with the flow
Maybe not the best pay
none come to mind now
Heavy metrics, micromanaged, everything is watched

Work-life balance for sales is shrinking little by little
Senior leadership is stuck in there ways and rolls things out to early. Indeed has changed a lot since I started in 5+ years ago and not in a good way. Quota attainment does not depend on your skill, it more luck than anything.
Hard to get promoted and base salary takes a long time to increase. Each quarter only a small Director and Team Lead roles open up and with so many reps its hard to get promoted. Lot of changes and have to roll with the punches. Teams and books change a lot.
KPI expectations from upper management can sometimes be unrealistic.
Not all managers have the right development skills
no structure, teams do not work together (work in silo), disconnected team
Too chill. Not a lot of growth opportunities. Not the most driven / ambitious people
Tools are a bit outdated Pace of change can be a little slow Recruitment heavily advertised that Indeed was 'different' than other layoff happy tech companies, when in fact it was not. I know all recruiters lie but I would say that Indeed puts in more effort to cultivate itself as a compassionate workplace so that the difference between what was advertised and what happened was more jarring than it probably was at other places.
Lacking personal and professional development opportunities.
Executive management is overly concerned with hiring executives that check the diversity box, instead of forming a solid business strategy that can withstand business cycles. Highly dependent on one product for most of their revenue, and not willing to disrupt themselves. There was no interest in technologies like blockchain or AI, which have vast potential and could be major industry disruptors.
Weak product leadership with little knowledge on best PM practice. This is not a good place to learn how to be a good PM. Folks have different expectations on what PMs should do and expect PMs to solely execute and program management. Short-term focused and short-sighted execution with no focus on a coherent product vision and well defined product strategy. Inconsistent and opaque decision making process with no open communication between ICs and VPs. Poor and inefficient middle management is making it worse. To my surprise my manager is doing IC work (i.e. duplicating my work) instead of reviewing/editing my work.

When it comes to working at Indeed, I’d say I was their biggest advocate — until now. Once 3-4 people at the top decided to resign or move on to other opportunities after being with the company for 14+ years and then the layoffs took place the company was no longer the dream it initially was. The micromanaging corporate America style has settled in. How your quota is determined is not something you will ever know, the system itself not logging accurately which is also how your performance is determined because you're just a number now & with constant changes at the beginning of every quarter and now sometimes even within the quarter itself. It seems as if they truly have no idea how to manage the current market trends and continuously push products that are not only disruptive to their clients, but employees as well. I would say this restructure is not one anyone is pleased with and the salary is not enough for what you’ll have to do on a daily basis. The environment has become chaotic, with no downtime, never clear answers, and unnecessary documentation & a role that was once taking pride in sales has become more focused on making sure administrative work is prioritized versus the sales. A company where we once were treated like humans/people is now only just a number. With quotas becoming unattainable due to the current market they continue to increase and micromanage every aspect of your book of business which in reality isn't leading to more sales, just more stress as the company panics that revenue expectations are not being met, by almost EVERYONE. Rather than listening to the feedback we as employees are providing, along with the feedback our clients are providing -- it's like they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off and you'll get cut along the way. If your workload is already up to your head, dont worry, more will be added. Not only that, rather than closing the offices to save costs since everyone was successfully doing the role and doing it well from home for 3 years, they decided its best to keep the offices open, lay off 2200 people and make those who are current employees come into the office 2x a week on Tuesday & Wednesday. Imagine having to pay rent or pay for a hotel because you have to commute and come into the office twice for a role you've done remotely for 3 years.
Too many lazy people and hard workers take on the brunt of the responsibilities. Just had a layoff in March, 15% of the total company.
lack of growth and opportunity

Rotating leadership prohibits growth from with in
Changes come quickly and organizational changes aren't always very transparent, so I've found I need to be very flexible and go with the flow
I joined a platform team in a business that doesn't really understand platform product strategy or even product management best practices for Agile in a unified manner across the business. For example, each product and engineering team managed their jira projects in a silo without a unified understanding or definition of various ticket types, their relationships to one another, or even how to build a structured roadmap/plan view. In addition to this, the company *wants* to build a platform strategy and talks about it at the T0/1 leadership level, but there was no active charter to define what a product platform is and what the growth strategy should be for various platform teams.
not much to say in regards to cons
- The March 2023 layoff was a sharp unexpected change in culture - The promotion process had improved, but was still difficult to navigate - Tech hiring under-emphasizes soft skills, even though they are critical to success at the company
Messy product development process that can lead to mistakes
- Pace of change in leadership and direction
Annual Quotas are tough Attainment to quota can be very dependent on the economy as a whole
Indeed is a large company with many departments. Speaking on the department I was in: there was very little direction and goals were very vague quarter to quarter. This put immediate team leads and managers in the awkward position of needing to do the jobs of their higher-ups (and for not much more pay than their direct reports). Some folks in leadership roles consistently played favorites and created roles for unqualified team members to get promoted into. When looking to join a different department, the internal job interview process was clunky and cumbersome. Any internal job seeker could get through 5 rounds of interviews only for that department to decide to cancel the role last minute. How does this happen at a company who vows to advocate for job seekers? An employee referral system is in place but if your referral is nearing 40 years in age, has ample job experience, and they’re not applying for a seasoned engineering role, then forget about it. Indeed knows inexperience is cheaper. (They like compensating at the lower end of the salary range.) This place is a stepping stone, but do not let the branding blind you. There is no mystique to working at Indeed. It is just as big and dysfunctional a corporation as any. I can guarantee that competence is not a requirement. It’s ultimately bad PR for them to lay people off but they’ll find other ways (voluntary severance) to trim the fat. Just be cautious and make sure that what you decide to do benefits you.
None at this time. The only ""con"" if you will is I do hope that they offer an optional flex schedule versus being in the office part of the week. It's not a con for the company, but rather just a personal desire for myself.

Sometimes difficult to contact people but no big issues.
not many I can think of
Not all managers have the right development skills
Quotas are a mess, stay away from Indeed for enterprise roles. They continually change through out the quarter and there is little to no transparency as to how they are calculated. Sr. Leadership changes metrics related to F2F meetings, weekly call expectations constantly (increasing), finance/billing issues fall on sales with little to NO support from our actual finance tran, very minimal training, very strict on expenses causing them to easily get rejected (everything goes on your personal credit card). If sales are down, leadership hits the panic button and wants control over everything we do. You are not empowered to do what is best for your book with the intimate knowledge you have. I could keep going...
Poor critical thinking at senior levels of leadership as well as culture of fiefdoms led to rapid expansion without enough work to go around and then a subsequent retraction as hiring budgets evaporated and projections dropped.
I was laid off so that was bit shocking, didn't really see it coming but otherwise everything while I was there was great.
Too many employees and many overlaps
Too metrics based, need to focus less on metrics and more on results
Not the most competitive pay.
This place is now run by leaders who have no idea how to lead, inspire or innovate. They hire diverse talent to “check the box” instead of hiring the most qualified candidate who can lead the charge for change. The culture that once made indeed great is gone.
Over the period of time, while the company might have seen unprecedented revenue growth during the pandemic in order of 2x per employee compared to the start of the pandemic, the leadership team has become an echo chamber. There is nothing but agreement with the CEO on everything. A lot of talented people have left and so have some executives.
Low pay, unclear responsibilities, and very high expectations.
Not so much. I love Indeed

- Onboarding process is the best I have ever had - The experimentation framework is decent - Some strong engineers and data scientists - Compensation and benefits are great, though RSUs are not promising
I really enjoy working with the people at this company. My co-workers are friendly and approachable, and many of them come from well-known companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The brand is also very appealing, and during my time working here, I felt proud to be associated with a brand that users love. The product offerings are well-designed and executed. In addition to the rideshare service, I have received positive feedback from friends who use Lyft Rental, and I personally enjoy using Lyft bikes. The company culture is inclusive and welcoming, and I feel a sense of connection and belonging among my colleagues.
Competitive pay, lovely teammates, great managers.
Pros? Good benefits. Generally nice people. It looks good on a resume. You can get your foot into the door of tech here. It's generally easy. As long as you avoid ANYTHING customer service related, seriously, don't work those positions at Lyft. They're terrible, exhausting, demoralizing, and impossible to escape from internally.
Some of the people was strange not friendly
Health Insurance Mental/Dental Some Leads are amazing
- smaller team sizes - easier to find projects you're passionate about - promo process is clear
Make your own hours. No boss or annoying coworkers. Great if you're a people person. Great if you have a disability, no walking, lifting 70 lbs, etc. No Physical exam. If you're a hustler, you can make okay money.

The people are great and the work is very interesting. The tech is miles better than most huge companies and the internal tools you do have to use are great. Pay is also nice; when the stock is online with offer. If it’s not, then you are making almost nothing.

The People! The people at Lyft are empathetic, enthusiastic, hilarious, understanding, hardworking, and supportive. I've never worked with better people, truly.
Pro- good benefits (medical, dental, mental health, fertility treatment, gender affirming care, etc, EXCEPT 401k matching).
great to employees great culture
Autonomy, opportunity, unlimited PTO, cross functional partnership
The talent Lyft attracts is amazing. You get to work with the best people here.
You meet great folks locally and you learn a lot about rideshare and what it really takes to run the business. Great benefits, great friendships built as well.
You are your own boss. You set your own hours.
Data-driven culture with highly motivated people.
Good technology and application development
Great team members, flexible work policy
","- bad leader - bad future
- Pink flavor of toxic Uber - obvious because a lot of folks here are ex-Uber. - Company will never be profitable - Engineers & PMs here are arrogant, toxic and political. They browbeat each other, torpedo each other's work, gossip, yell, falsely blame each other etc. This is the only company I have worked where the politics exists at the engineer/PM-level. Because the management is desperate to retain talent, if you are smart & arrogant you will be shielded at the expense of other employees. - The arrogance of the engineers does not match their talent level. Merely clever engineers, but lacking in maturity, experience and intellectual humility. If they worked at a place like Google, they will be humbled in a day. - My PM was a plagiarist and dating another PM in the same team, leading to all kinds of weird interactions but HR and upper management would not fix it. - Token DEI hires who do not meet the bar.
The Rideshare industry seems to face constant difficulties with profitability, and the pandemic has had a significant impact on the business. Additionally, there are pressures from drivers who want full-time employment and the benefits that come with it, such as health insurance. While the team is intelligent, decision-making can often be a slow process.
The leadership (David Risher, as well as those immediately under him) is driving the company to the ground. After two layoffs in less than six months, the company morale is at an all time low. Everyone around me is interviewing or have already left. Someone raised this concern to the leadership and all they said was “we are keeping an eye on the situation.” And? Aren’t you gonna do something to keep people from leaving? Oh right, they cut our comp by 10-20%. Great call. By the way, stay away from this company if you’re on H1b and want a green card. I have coworkers who were waiting to file their PERM, but the two layoffs really messed it up, because after each layoff, the company has to wait 180 days before they can file again. The April layoff happened less than 180 days after the November one, so they now have to wait another 180 days. That’s a whole freaking year. And they told me their H1b is only valid for 6 years in total. The leadership clearly doesn’t care about its international employees.
Be aware if someone's giving you a referral. You get a $1000 bonus for referring someone who gets hired, so make sure it's someone you trust who's giving you the scoop on what it's like to work at Lyft. Really hard to move up. Management will tell you whatever they need to to keep you placated. Pay is trash. Comp for similar roles in my area paid 20k higher Many roles are catch-all roles, where you do a little bit of what you'd expect, then a hundred other random tasks that someone needs to have done, and you can't say no to them. Inequality/bias happens. I found out that since I was in internal hire, I was paid a LOT less (15k less) than a new hire on our team who was 5 years less experienced than me. That stung. I negotiated for a raise and got a flat-out no. The company is in a tough spot in this economy, so they blame that on why they won't give raises. They're also making virtual employees go back in office. I was really glad to be laid off in April.
Well if you like drive when you want it great for that Not. For sure who was was being pick up do to someone else was paying for the ride
Some leads are not great Lack of Growth No Lyft Credit
- leadership doesnt know what theyre doing
Passengers can (and do) make up complaints about you in order to get free rides. The high cost of gas. One accident or breakdown or complaint, then what happens to your income? Poof.
Company’s changed a lot after the pandemic and economy issues

Pay; if the stock drops a lot. It has dropped a ton so you most likely aren’t gonna be making even close to what you are offered. I made roughly 60% of my TC which put me in line with no name companies. Layoffs; the company is spiraling and they keep having layoffs. They also only seem to layoff competent engineers so expect things to get harder generally. RTO; speaks for itself
Just be safe some weirdos here and there
It would be great if there was more room for advancement.
Rude people or sometimes gps lags or takes you the wrong way.
They nitpick. I have a 5 star rating, have all great reviews. But I don't accept as many rides as they want me to so they threaten to fire me due to poor customer feedback.
The people-first culture seems great at first, but you eventually realize that it's mostly a show. Layoffs were done with little empathy, and people absolutely got the sense that leadership didn't care at all. It seems like the company was always a step (or two) behind Uber. We'd find ourselves building features or making decisions after Uber and this seemed to cause our market share to keep slipping. Health & WFH benefits could be better.
Gas utilisation Tip Car maintenance people Income
Just be safe some weirdos here and there
Rapidly losing market share and due to years of soft feature launches and unable to land anything that doesn't generate revenue in the short term, there isn't much long term investment that can now be used for strength. New CEO will turn the ship around, but it will be a long time before it can be done.
It would be great if there was more room for advancement.
lots of processes get lost in transition when attrition occurs and leadership changes. Because so things are very ambiguous and not in a productive way

Leadership is evil. New leadership decided to lay off 30% of our workforce and tell those of us left we have to come back to office without an increase in pay for the next 12 months (after we've gone 15 without a raise) and no reimbursement for parking - all the while buying a new local office in the most expensive and hard to reach part of town. If you value your work-life balance or at the bare minimum want to feel valued for the hard work you're putting in, do not work here. New leadership doesn't even pretend to appreciate their hardworkers.
Too seasonal, company has bad customer service
Trouble reaching a person via telephone, everything has to be done through the app, no technical support during certain hours
Management were largely absent from site.

not profitable, many rounds of layoffs
commuting to the office daily
The driver app seems to spawn many new drivers at once and sometime in one city such as Galt, CA. In these cases, many Lyft drivers are driving in one spot which doesn't help the driver or the app.
Inconsistent work, day to day pay varies, wear and tear on personal vehicle.
No one really rips that well
The Leaders are the worst
The pay is less than that of the same work at other companies
Took on more responsibility than role required and was often swamped.
- Volatile business - Constantly changing priorities

leadership, and most of the decisions made by team. they at least used to be able to hire quality talent. but now...
Leadership was all over the place in terms of trying new business ideas which created a distraction from the main rideshare business. Now the service is a joke.
They laid me about 1,000 other people off but the new CEO took a multimillion dollar bonus to join the company.
The Leaders are the worst
Constant reorgs and priority shifts.
Full time driving does not make you much money and puts a lot of miles on the car. Their customer service is horrible. If you ever have an issue, it's best to just accept the bad, otherwise you will waste a bunch of time chatting with someone who will pretend to care but never solve a problem. You must accept all service animals, but can't ask if an animal is really a service animal, so you must accept all animals. Being allergic to animals will not allow you an exception from that rule.
Charging stations are not nearly as frequent OR in good standing order to charge EV effectively. The time it takes to charge vehicle is time used to just sit and recharge. Zero profit to be made of not putting 40 hour weeks, As I am now on serious debt renting this complete sham of a business. The LYFT platform itself is a joke and cannot believe people actually have success stories working for them.

Where to begin... First and foremost, I would hope anyone in HR would read this: I make this very loud and clear when people say this place is toxic, it is TOXIC. Management doesn't intervene into coworker quarrels unless someone from HR brings up a complain from an employee and then that's where they intervene. There is also issues with management that support the kind of people who do barely the bare minimum and give flack for those who go the extra mile to prove themselves as actual employees that want to work to do better. I've had issues amongst colleagues that plot and snitch behind their fellow colleagues to bring them down just because those people don't want to do better themselves. Lyft promotes the idea of ""everyone is a family"", ""unity"", ""solidarity"", and other buzzwords to reel in candidates to work for them. What they really do is not what they say they do. There is no one to oversee how employees are treating other employees like enemies and it makes it hard for those who want to change the tide in the workplace, feel threatened, anxious, and demoralized. Nepotism, lack of integrity, maturity, and yet they make us take all those dumb video trainings to not condone that.

Micromanagement from local leadership where OM maybe because she came from Retail would be on top of your Lead asking questions about our daily routine. Employee Relations is biased and will not investigate matters properly, watched many employees being terminated simply because team members raised questions to Regional Director. Growth on a local level was limited to other team members leaving the company. Overloaded with side project from other teams to make management look good.
Some senior management have no empathy the company isnt doing well
Need to work odd hours to make any money. Early mornings (4/5am) or late nights for example. Too many drivers most of the time.
They laid me about 1,000 other people off but the new CEO took a multimillion dollar bonus to join the company.
Constant reorgs and priority shifts.
tends to abandon projects mid-way
We had multiple reorgs/rifs in my time there, which made things tough. While the current changes have been difficult and resulted in me getting laid off I hope that the new CEO can put the company on the path to success.
deteriorating culture changing strategies declining stock
Due to stock price comp is reduced XXXXX times
Stock drops significantly and lots of people left
not competitive salary, horrible new CEO, horrible management, company is a sinking ship, got laid off, no opportunities for growth
The platform is terrible. They cheat you out of earnings and blame it on the location. I have been cheated out of cancellation and streak bonuses more that 3 times! Just deleted the app today! Their main excuse will always come down to your location when anyone who is anyone knows GPS locations are not always accurate, they don't account for roadblocks, so that means you will be penalized for any issue where you're unable to access an exact location. Steer clear these people DO NOT CARE about you as an individual like most, all they are concerned with is you generating them more money. Don't even waste your time with the hassle or put wear and tear on your car!
Have a long term vision for the company.
This is a very toxic work environment. Leadership is a joke - seriously. I think they all just chill and grocery shop during the day then complain that they have too many people to Manager (usually 4-5 ppl). The bar is incredibly low for leadership at lyft. I’ve never seen anything like it. Nothing is expected of them and when cuts come - they’ll cut the entire workforce (which has happened) before they let the lousy managers go. They are NOT subject matter experts and are not expected to know anything.
Miami Drivers are insane, Lyft takes more than they use to. No longer 80/20. It's about 50/50. They are stealing more for themselves & their investors. Both the passenger & the driver get screwed, but overall the gross pay is still pretty decent compared to regular jobs that don't require advanced degrees or certifications. You will burnout if you don't take care of yourself. Make sure to counterbalance the long hours of sitting with proper diet, exercise, & healthy outlets.
Daily injection of brain trash is really bad
Corporate side has new leadership and seems to already be causing a stir in regards to RTO. There is a disconnect between local offices and HQ
Not aggressive enough expansion in to new markets.
Stocks Most smart senior engineers left Company is always restructuring Constant fear of layoffs Low morale
Confusing priorities at times and all projects didn't feel incredibly impactful
Lack of trust in leadership, and hard to see a real direction and strategy for the company. Very little in the form of actual career pathways— kind of just stay in whatever role you have.
Poor management A lot of layoffs Shifting priorities New CEO forcing return to office Doesn’t do real bonuses, just equity After layoffs asking staff to do more with less

None that I know of.
None really. I wish they would take out estimated taxes automatically.. but it’s part of being a non employee. Yes your car will add up miles and require more maintaining, but income will more than make up for it.
Some senior management have no empathy the company isnt doing well
Nothing bad they are great !!!
Need to work odd hours to make any money. Early mornings (4/5am) or late nights for example. Too many drivers most of the time.
Poor business decisions at the top really messed everything up coming out of the pandemic. Hiring a new CEO and instilling a RTO policy on top of mass layoffs and pay cuts... SUCH a disappointment to see.
-Hard to move up -Discouraging ""cog in the machine"" feeling -Leveling dampens your efforts to move ahead in career -Undercompensation for role -instability of sector -If you're hourly, they watch you like a hawk. -If you have unlimited PTO in a higher role, you might get some judgement for using your PTO benefit. -No 401k matching
Bad business model, not profitable
Low pay in comparison to market rates, required RTO after 4+ years of perm remote, lack of structure/documentation, too many layers of management
Company needs to work on their long term vision
Corporate side has new leadership and seems to already be causing a stir in regards to RTO. There is a disconnect between local offices and HQ
I put 30K on my vehicle. They took $29,788.64 in fees. On the rare occasion that I needed help with a problem, it was extremely difficult to get guidance/and or an answer in a timely fashion.

","I have nothing to say negatively about Advantage.
One word. Training. They have a sketchy training set up and they are trying to do better it was just particularly bad when I started. It can make the job frustrating for sure.

The first two weeks of the month can require a lot of hours (up to 60 hrs).
High Pressure and Targets: Recruiting can be a high-pressure job, particularly if you are working in a fast-paced environment or with strict targets. Meeting hiring quotas and tight deadlines can lead to stress and burnout. Dealing with Rejection: As a recruiter, you frequently encounter situations where candidates are not selected for a particular role. Delivering rejection news and managing disappointed or frustrated candidates can be emotionally draining and challenging. Unpredictable Work Hours: Recruiting often involves working outside traditional office hours, especially when coordinating interviews with candidates who have other commitments. This can lead to irregular work schedules, making work-life balance more difficult. Competitive Industry: The recruiting industry is highly competitive, with numerous recruitment agencies and in-house recruiting teams vying for top talent. This can result in fierce competition for clients and job placements, which may add extra pressure to your role. Administrative Tasks: Recruiting involves a significant amount of administrative work, such as managing applicant tracking systems, reviewing resumes, scheduling interviews, and coordinating with various stakeholders. The administrative workload can sometimes feel overwhelming and time-consuming.
I left because minimum wage was rising in my state but my pay was not. After three years, I was still making the same wage when I started, less than $1 above minimum wage. You will NEVER get a raise.
Low pay , health Benefits not good.
Responsible for a very large work load.
No training, reverse discrimination, bullying, manipulation, management with no knowledge and no way to find out information from company. Tried to violate HIPPA and abuse toward employees!
Heavy workload, workplace bullying, lack of technical leadership in some departments, lack of documentation on some teams
Training is scarce and there are several aspects of the job that are taught on an ""as it comes"" basis; which can be really stressful. Also, there isn't really positive reinforcement; but they sure do let you know when you're doing something wrong.
Don't always have products for event, no increase in pay, no training for new employees. Employees from other companies ie. Supply's, get paid more than actual advantage employees for the identical job

Never been hired this way (virtually) was a bit nerve racking with all of the scams out there. A bit more contact from the hiring managers would have been nice. A week before the start date I asked when my equipment would ship since I hadn't heard from anyone. They asked for my address and due to the delay my laptop would not be arriving until my actual start date, I was told due to supply issues. I got an email stating it shipped with no tracking number to keep an eye on things.

Didn’t experience any. Job offers much potential for growth for the willing person. Fuel reimbursement could be a challenge depending on what type of vehicle you drive. That was not the case for me. Be sure to do your research & calculate avg. gas mileage your vehicle gets back. Reimbursement. If you don’t, I believe that is a “you” failure, not management. It is hard when people don’t as the company puts a lot into training just for them to get a week in and quit.

- Terrible management - Projects not great for career growth - Constant harassment from managers - Poor pay
Little to no support. Most management teams wont even know your scheduled to do an eventually leading to confusion.
Extremely low salaries for industry. They’ve been promising raises, meeting standards, promotions etc for a few years now and it hasn’t happened so need to assume they’re lying. New leadership isn’t great. They fired a ton of experienced people who were familiar with the company and could’ve been promoted, in favor of new hires who are clueless and not in line with company culture. Employees, especially the lowest paid ones, are struggling to continue on. Between layoffs, high turnover, and poor restructuring plans, there’s a ton of confusion on what is what.
The place was racist, disorganized (no one knew who should be doing what), and they constantly were throwing extra work at you. The training was subpar. They give you a packet or a piece of paper and think you should be an expert now. Someone was sexually harassed and they fired the victim, not the assaulted…
A lot of turnover for such a big company
Low pay and Little to know raises
Managers are a little too pushy and unknowledgeable
The pay is not very promising.
None I can think of
There is no on the job training, you're kind of just thrown into it with nobody to show you how to locate your extra supplies and event kits. The cart is big and not real heavy but difficult to manuever around the shoppers especially when they're not paying attention. You are provided a debit card for purchasing the food supplies and supplies for the cart like paper towels and utensils. Shopping and setting up the cart takes me at least an hour to hour and a half before I begin cooking! It is January 8th and I'm still waiting for the rest of my schedule to post which might give me a couple days notice only. I'm glad I have another job to fall back on during the slow time at Advantage Solutions
A lot of time is spent driving however you are fairly compensated for your time and mileage.
Everyone is just a number. There's zero emotion. People get laid off left and right.
Low wages,no raises, no performance reviews, unresponsive management to concern/complaints. Direct RM is not professional, dishonest.
The pay scale is por new people with no experience walking in making more money then people that have been with the company 5+ years
No raises for retail employees. Upper Management/Corporate do not take care of Retail workers. Over 10 years still made the same as when I started. Now the new hires hourly salary higher than I made.
I have not yet seen any cons with working with Advantage Solutions.
Poor wage, raises and bonuses when exceeding sales goals and earning ‘exceeds expectations’ rating during annual reviews. Mileage reimbursement is so sub-standard that you are basically paying out of pocket to continue the maintence on your personal vehicle and fuel in the car to work your territory. Unqualified managers Upper management negotiates contracts with companies to promote and sell their products. The money allocated per employee for wages, bonuses, etc. are all determined by Advantage. The majority of contract dollars go to upper management and the lower level employees are sacrificed. Turnover is high. The arrogance of upper management lost major contracts for their vendors with big box stores and massive retail giants.
not the highest pay not a ton of room for growth. the benefits for health are very bad however its a full remote position
There really isn't anything negative.
No opportunity to grow, high cost of medical
None I can think of
Expensive benefits, company pretends to have the best interest of their employees at heart.

Training was very poor, you were shown something one time and if you had a question, you were told to follow notes. Upper management was not much better.

No pay increases. Promises of bonuses that you never get Unrealistic financial goals No support from management Refuse to hire according to what headcount is needed to effectively run the business

Hard to penetrate the executive level from inside the org.
Benefits are expensive, if you have a family and you want good coverage you will be paying $1000+ a month. And if you are a low level employee that could be almost 30-40% off your paycheck
Driving in Houston traffic 88 stores a month
I really have no cons to say about the company. The only cons I have is working from home I do not get out much. Miss interacting with people!
No opportunity to grow, high cost of medical
Huge company, can be hard to connect with others.
Expensive benefits, company pretends to have the best interest of their employees at heart.
Managers, home time, pay, paid leave
Sometimes the workload was too much for one person.
Not a great company if your older and on your way out
Pay is below average compared to market
No growth opportunities, New CEO trying to change processes without understanding their effects.
Ok ok travel pay not enough
I have not come across any as of yet
Travel a lot from site to site every month. When the team is short, they dont hire any to fill, they move responsibilities to other members of the team without compensation increases.
Training was very poor, you were shown something one time and if you had a question, you were told to follow notes. Upper management was not much better.
Low pay. Could be better
Standing long periods of time. In my Walmart the bathroom is on the opposite side of the store. I'm also unable to cook in my store. Most of my events are backup. Putting together the back drop was difficult there is absolutely no roo. In my store to put anything together.
No pay increases. Promises of bonuses that you never get Unrealistic financial goals No support from management Refuse to hire according to what headcount is needed to effectively run the business
The Target is the worst store I worked at
Huge company, can be hard to connect with others.
During the interview process I was not told it would be a 6 month assignment. Then after speaking to company I would be supporting they told me oh no only needed for 3 month assignment. Then contract renegotiated after 3 months and I was told would be 1 year then 4 months later it was who knows when and contract renegotiated again. You will never get a honest answer. They lie and tell you what you want to hear. Also pay well below industry standards with no bonus. 3 CEO's in 17 months should tell you something in itself.
money too small driving and
-There's exactly one manager for over forty different locations, and he apparently has very little power over what goes on in store. -They expect Event Specialists (product demonstrators) to stand in the same spot for five hours a day. Stools are available with a medical exemption, but chairs are not allowed.
Management had unrealistic expectations. Management threatened my job if I could not come in because I was hurt.
Managers, home time, pay, paid leave
Sometimes the workload was too much for one person.
Not a great company if your older and on your way out
Pay is below average compared to market
No growth opportunities, New CEO trying to change processes without understanding their effects.
I have no cons about this company
More training materials, better communication, more inclusive
Have to deal with rude members for low pay
No negative comments from me
Management The whole company is failing. The keep laying people off. They aren't charging clients enough. No updated contacts. If you want to transfer teams you have to apply like a regular job. NO ONE cares if you're about to be laid off. How many compliments or how much money you male the company. You will apply you will interview multiple times. And they will ALWAYS choose an outside candidate with no experience.
Benefits are ok and somewhat expensive
I’ve been with the company for over 3 years now and I still cannot afford the cost of living. Salary and wages are brought up almost constantly but nothing is done. The insurance is expensive because surprise surprise Advantage wants to pay the bare minimum. Advantage wants you to get excited when they give you a 25 cent an hour raise. Give me a break. There’s a reason why turnover is so high and they can’t hang on to their good employees.
Most of your communication between managers and team members is through email and conference calls Managers in some stores are difficult to work with and makes it hard to do your job Forced to sell in pallets of product
May have to work minimum hours until more shifts are available.
Felt like I was on an island at times. Expected to figure it out even when necessary resources are lacking but that's alot of companies these days.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Texas-Roadhouse-Reviews-E18664.htm,"Good management, flexible scheduling, great money, good people
They are very flexible with scheduling
I worked at Texas Roadhouse and I was Headwait, an in store trainer, food prep and I did some administrative stuff as well. I didn't get paid what I was worth, at all. For another, my manager had a probably with me and it made work difficult. I worked there from 1997-2000. I left after our location caught fire. I did try to hang in but after we reopened,the smell of the smoke clung to the wood interior and business tanked.
Flexible schedule Work as much or as little as you want
Always busy, good tips, best restaurant in town as far as making good money and their food is bomb as well!
The staff was such a great group. Coming into the job having no prior training for serving, I was really nervous. I had endless support from other staff members on any questions or if I needed help and got to create some lasting friendships.
Love the coworkers Easy money Flexible days (but need to work weekends)

Good for college students or high school students.
Tips can be good at times
-Good way to get into food service -Friendly coworkers -Decent Management, tends to have your back with difficult guests
Pay was decent, my location was busier than most though (tip share + 7.98). Easy to request off Typically a relaxed work environment
Good employees to work with
Good food not bad at all
Always busy so you’re going to make money regardless. Decent priced food so if you upsell more your tabs will always be higher. Out of all the restaurants I worked at it honestly had the most structure. Fun fast paced environment. You just have to be motivated to actually work and bust your butt. Easy to ask for days off would work with schedule. No silverware
flexible schedule, gas reimbursement, entrepreneur mindset
I love how close of a family the employees are. Everyone has everyone's back, everyone wants to support you and help you when you're in need. The schedule is also super flexible!
Flexible schedule Great for college students Quick cash Great for social life
Easy interview process for most positions.
decent money and flexible schedule
It’s top quality for a serving job, so it’s to be expected.
Great Co-Workers Clean work environment
Alright pay, good staff, long breaks
Lots of opportunities to cross train, opportunities to advance, holiday pay
I enjoyed working here and the pay was okay for what I wa doingv
Fun, enthusiastic, and clean, management gives good hours and tips included on top of hourly pay.
Decent money for a part time
Stable reliable income always had hours to work
Fast-paced environment kept my mind busy. Rewarding to make great food, help new employees blossom, and improve training programs. Free food on every shift. Employees families receive a 30% discount. One day a week (my ""TC day"") was completely flexible, so I could come in whenever I wanted and on whatever day I wanted. Several coworkers have become life long friends. Andy's Outreach is a free financial assistance program for employees in crisis.

There was a really good employee discount. My coworkers were lovely and the management was nice to your face. The schedule was flexible, which was good for emergencies or last-minute conflicts. All employees, even part-time, receive TXRH's benefits with other companies, such as discounts on memberships and subscriptions. While working here, I had a non-work-related injury, and they handled my accommodations well and without complaint. Pay is weekly and always on time. My particular location is extremely clean and well-organized. My initial interview was very quick and low-pressure.
Good. Servers and managers are friendly
The fun, supportive culture of the brand makes a tough industry worth it.
Great $$ and co workers
Awesome environment with great customers
flexible schedule, gas reimbursement, entrepreneur mindset
If you know what you're doing its always busy, you'll have plenty of chances to make money if you're willing to work the amount of days or double on busier days (Some holidays, or the Friday and Sat Doubles)
Team oriented environment. Friendly employees and great food!

I've worked here for almost 3 years and can say it is one of the best restaurants I have ever worked for. You can receive benefits depending on hours, and the company is very flexible and understanding.

andy’s outreach program, team friendly environment, always busy so money is there,
fun to work at good pay
Fun environment, fun people to work with, grow quickly as a hostess to higher host duties
Your co-workers are like family and teamwork is there number one goal. Lots of room for advancement.
Unlike some places, if you get hired for anything let's say dishwashing you end up doing a lot more other things than what you actually signed up for just because they did not have enough people or the manager decides to just throw you in, however, in Texas Roadhouse at least in my experience is not the case. I am actually doing what I signed up for nothing more and nothing less.
The management at this location is great Fast-paced changing environment
You have the ability to do well in tips if you work hard.
Corporate has enough rules and guidelines in place to make the job pretty smooth and easy in theory, it just all comes down to your management team.
Great tips Teamwork Great hours Fast paced Easy to grow
Great place to work, and great people to work with!
Make money while serving and usually busy. Very organized training and fun environment
people that you work with
great co workers and great money
always always busy. Its a steak place so that 20% is going to be pretty sweet. And now they have those table pay screen things where the customer checks themself out and it normally auto suggests 20%. Of all the restaurants ive worked at, this one was the most consistent with scheduling. They wont change things on you at the drop of a hat and will generally try to work with you if you have something going on. I saw really awful exceptions to this once or twice but those incidents were the exception no the rule.
Love how family oriented the staff is. It’s a pleasure to be aquatinted with so many amazing people!
Great coworkers Fast-paced Fun environment Lots of incentives Managers really care about you as a person and they're good at their jobs
Flexible Schedule. Amazing Co-workers. Managers that care.
Fun competitions, good tips, fast paced
great staff, good tips on most nights
great environment, fun loving, great energy
Great work environment excellent managers
pay, flexable schedule, free food
","Only con is we open at 3 on weekdays so no morning shifts
The worst part is the mystery shops. It makes you not want to work there. You are required to say key words like, ""Fresh Baked Bread, Ice Cold Beer, Legendary Margaritas, Hand Cut Steals, Fall of the Bone Ribs, and Made From Scratch Sides and Dressings"" If you don't say 4, you get points counted off. If you don't greet someone within 15 seconds, you get points counted off. If a manager doesn't say hi to a guest, you get points counted off. You can also not leave the bar, but if the food doesn't make it to a guest in time, you get points counted off. You also can't grab anyone bread, or you get points counted off. You are at the mercy of yelling at servers to help you. If you are busy making drinks for the entire restaurant and can't make ""engaging conversation"", you get points counted off. There is also no tip out for bartenders, even though you're required to make drinks for the entire restaurant. Then, several months of every year, they make you compete against every other bar and shop you twice a month. If you score lose and score low, management gets mad and suspense you from the bar. Then, makes you compete for a spot.
Unable to grat large checks, rude guests, management that expected way too much for $2.13 an hour
Management doesn’t care about employees, views employees as replaceable, you get paid 2.13 an hour and rely on tips, there is no automatic gratuity for large parties, theres a 3% tip out on food sales, so if you sell 100 in food you owe the restaurant $3 even if the table doesn’t tip you anything, you stay for sometimes 2 hours after closing completing side work while still getting paid 2.13 an hour, there are no breaks to eat even if you work 12+ hours straight, management has favorites and they are the only ones who get good sections and make good money.
Only 3 tables, favoritism (but that's about Anywhere you go), drama drama drama omg i felt 16 again & back in highschool! Don't kill yourself good above and beyond for this company because chances are you won't even be acknowledged by higher ups... Don't get me wrong though this company is suppose to value and care about/ help out their employees and I'm sure the majority of other locations will be the opposite like the late founder envisioned when he first started texas road house!!
The only reason I left was needing something that was more stable as in I knew exactly what to expect from my paychecks. I still served part time up until Covid lockdown and then chose to not return. Things that did not work for me was having to give up my weekend if I wanted to make really good money. It became difficult to balance seeing family and missing out some but it’s a reality with serving that that is where you’ll make the most money.
-The manager isn’t sympathetic/doesn’t take your side with customer complaints whatsoever Even if you never faced an issue similar before -You WILL work 12pm/1pm to 11pm Saturday and Sunday -You will have days where they cut you out of order and you just got there/ work late even when you were first one… BUT there have been slight improvements on this
If you aren't into corporate sayings you will struggle because we have story points that are recommended to be said to
ijbagaiergv gnpaeiorng kanrgoaierg oianergoinaer egaw
-Some guests are entitled and rude (common issue in guest service, sadly) -Hours are inconsistent -Holidays are insane and sadly many people tip little to nothing in To-Go area

Don't recommend for full-time, toxic environment and managers steal wages and make minors work more than they are supposed to.
People dont like to tip 20%, management is bad
-Some guests are entitled and rude (common issue in guest service, sadly) -Hours are inconsistent -Holidays are insane and sadly many people tip little to nothing in To-Go area
Manager-dependent, change in management made the job a lot worse. Very difficult to progress Bussers always short staffed
Everything Worst management in service industry Hours get cut, or you get taken off schedule for no reason Worst paying waitress job ever had..and been doing this 12 years
ok I guess row ok
Lots of sidework. No auto grat for large parties which suck cause iykyk that not all those large parties are going to tip well and they’ll run you like crazy. Only 3 table sections
negative atmosphere from servers, culture change-not for the best.
Too much fun is had sometimes on the job. Can sometimes be stressful when you are seated all at once and there isn't enough help. There is also a three table limit per section and the schedule/ assigned sections are often copied and pasted.
Takes time to work up to the good sections You only get 3 tables at a time
Hours can be too flexible
Terrible management, lots of favoritism, and management was never on the side of employees. If a guest complained regardless of the situation you were automatically in the wrong.
Management wasn’t great, customers weren’t respectful.
Never knew when you would get off (under 18 so no DL), which was very hard for the people that gave me rides since you were lowest on totem pole, everyone passed their end of shift side work to you, on top of your own. Lastly I only made $8 an hour (including tips), which is definitely under minimum wage.
boss was a creep, customers were rude
Short breaks for 12 hour shifts, always busy, lots of work to do all the time, feet hurt bad from standing all the time
Very busy environment and low pay
No cons. I personally loved this job but I was looking to serve somewhere closer to my school.
This is only at Miami - flagler location. Management is absurd and very unfair . As a server you are expected to have a running side work(which includes carrying ice buckets, heavy glassware, cleaning the floors, etc). These are side works that SAs(Server Assistants) do at most restaurants. You are also seated your tables up to the very last second the restaurant closes(which means you will leave extra late), You will have to buzz, sweep under and set up you tables after you are done(since buzzers get a special treatment and clock out half an hour before closing), and on top of that you are required to do up to two closing sideworks(which include anything from restocking the bars glassware or mopping the kitchen alley). Plus, as a server you need to run ALL the trays of food and you are yelled at and forced to keep all the kitchen tickets to show the manager at the end of the shift(they force you to run at least 25 minimum trays if not you will get penalized with a 2 table section). Managers really do not care about you as a worker. Literally a customer could be throwing bricks at you and the MP will apologize to the customer and give the a coupon. Very bad working experience
Had no holidays or weekends with family or friends
Excessive heat in the kitchen. I would go home drenched in my own sweat. No paid breaks. Shifts are so busy there's barely enough time to get water or use the restroom. No tip share for kitchen employees, and no increased compensation for working busy shifts (even holidays). Employees are required to cover their shift if they call out sick. I once called out because I was so sick I was having trouble standing, and since there was so no one available to cover my shift, my boss told me I didn't care about my job. Sexual harassment is persistent and management would rather give out second or even seventh chances rather than take care of the problem. Several employees complained about one of the managers hitting on them, and even a guest pointed out the issue, but the Managing Partner insisted the stories were all made up. Several employees struggle with anger management and are not reprimanded. I watched an employee hit a manager in anger and he wasn't fired until a year later. The Managing Partner and all of the salaried managers insisted on selling food that had passed it's company appointed ""best by"" date. Training Coordinator is a thankless job. My Managing Partner asked my opinion on a training issue (in front of several other employees), and then went with his own idea instead. When I asked him why even ask my opinion, he told me he doesn't care about my opinion; he just asks to be nice. No benefits until you've worked there a full year.
Very fast paced On feet at all times
turnover is high, but its the restaurant business.
No benefits for part time
None come to mind for cons.
Management They have absolutely no proper way of dealing with things. They are TOXIC and nasty towards you if they do not like you. They will find a reason …
There was very little room for growth within the company. It took over 3 years for my coworker to receive a raise/promotion. Management will only respond to emails/texts about 35% of the time. Upon hiring, the hiring manager completely avoided any questions about base pay, only saying that we got tip-share. You do not get any breaks unless you work a double (so no breaks for up to 7 or so hours), and you have no opportunity to sit unless you go to the bathroom. The schedule is usually posted EXTREMELY last minute, as in less than 24 hours before the start of the new pay period. When I was first hired, it took WEEKS for me to get my login to HotSchedules, my clock-in card, and access to my first check.
There are no cons i can think of
Not specific to TXRH, night and weekend schedules and challenges in high turnover can make quality of life difficult in this industry.
Busy busy busy and long hours
The hours are pretty crazy
negative atmosphere from servers, culture change-not for the best.
As with most restaurants, typically understaffed up for the front of the house Manager will typically care more about the sales and stuff like that than the staff, *higher the manager that less they care about you*
No cons. Everyone is great.
Terrible management, lots of favoritism, and management was never on the side of employees. If a guest complained regardless of the situation you were automatically in the wrong.
-it’s a restaurant -^so just the normal food service complaints that you’re likely to make at any restaurant lol EXCEPT -there is no autograt. Apparently it’s against “southern hospitality” to automatically apply a 20% tip to large parties, but is totally hospitable to tip a server $5 for your party of 20’s $500 tab. Granted, my example is an extreme, but it HAS happened more than once and getting tipped 20% for a large party is RARE here. As such, servers avoid taking them, so that’s annoying. There’s nothing management can really do about this and they try to disperse parties fairly since no one wants to take them, though, so that’s nice at least.
be mindful of location that you chose better location better clientel
None loved this company and would recommend to anyone

I loved working there. I only left because I moved to another state.
Customers can get annoying but overall fine

Can be very busy at times
Long hours that you have to work
Low food prices on the menu

Several employees struggle with anger management and are not reprimanded. I watched an employee hit a manager in anger and he wasn't fired until a year later. The Managing Partner and all of the salaried managers insisted on selling food that had passed it's company appointed ""best by"" date. Training Coordinator is a thankless job. My Managing Partner asked my opinion on a training issue (in front of several other employees), and then went with his own idea instead. When I asked him why even ask my opinion, he told me he doesn't care about my opinion; he just asks to be nice. No benefits until you've worked there a full year.
Working on holidays Late nights
A bit overworked for the pay
Management They have absolutely no proper way of dealing with things. They are TOXIC and nasty towards you if they do not like you. They will find a reason …
There was very little room for growth within the company. It took over 3 years for my coworker to receive a raise/promotion. Management will only respond to emails/texts about 35% of the time. Upon hiring, the hiring manager completely avoided any questions about base pay, only saying that we got tip-share. You do not get any breaks unless you work a double (so no breaks for up to 7 or so hours), and you have no opportunity to sit unless you go to the bathroom. The schedule is usually posted EXTREMELY last minute, as in less than 24 hours before the start of the new pay period. When I was first hired, it took WEEKS for me to get my login to HotSchedules, my clock-in card, and access to my first check.
To many incentives and line dancing
No cons don't like it
Just like any other restaurant, long hours, demanding tasks, and can't forget the line dancing every 45 mins.
Not a professional career Can be boring
Very few cons associated with this job
This is a very stressful job.
Very little hourly rate of pay
-stressful -closing past midnight occasionally -hourly pay
-Not enough money -Responsibilities of others and not getting appreciated -Late hours (Serving)
Needs better examples of management could improve to be more hands on and listen not act on employees. Take ownership.
limit to 3 table sections, company wide policies prohibiting facial piercings (we’re passed that these days),
hours were late some nights and sometinmes no breaks
Sometimes stayed very late even when dining area wasn’t busy
There are no cons it's a very balanced company
It can be extremely busy there and closing sometimes is just tedious.
If you are part time, hours can change very quickly if you arent careful
Constantly busy, not a lot of freedom to operate how you want.
ive worked at a college town TXRH that saw a bunch of transfers from other roadhouses, and without fail every single one said our management made the job unbearable.
Drama Closing work can be tough
Slightly fast paced but that’s what makes it great!
Favoritism plays a role in scheduling and certain aspects of the job
service industry is always stressful
management isnt all that great
Its extremely cramped in there. The terrible layout of the restaurant means you will get stuck and you will have to pack into the kitchen like a sardine. They play ""games"" in the back they claim are optional to trick you into pestering customer to buy things they dont want. The trick is that they will try to pretend they are optional and then absolutely ride you about it if you cant convince 10 people that day that putting mushrooms on an expensive steak isnt an incredibly stupid thing to do. I hate being made to feel like a 3rd grader with some kind of pizza party and a coloring book page being held over my head like its an incentive. Im a grown person thank you. One manager will always be absurd about riding you about it. It doesnt matter how frequently the management swaps out. One of them will always be real weird about it.
Some days are slower than usual.
None that are specific to Roadhouse. Just regular service industry stuff. It was kind of annoying that we could only have three tables at a time but I always left making anything from 15-45$ an hour.
Can be late hours. Pay is not consistent (based off of tips earned, normal within a restaurant)
Drama, gossip, not an environment I’d want to stay in long
leadership is disorganized and sometimes shows lack of care for employees
empty promises, mis directed.. the mp is great but management has their own wants. it gets confusing on what actually is to be... iv been asked to come in several times then to only be told to ""get out"" from management... it is bad. The other is everyone gets different treatment... if you're Mexican it seems rules don't apply to you, shafting hard working Americans. sometimes its a kick to the gut.
Can be slow at times
managers are power tripping and get mad at you only when they are upset for another reason

The company mission statement is inspiring but what is more inspiring is the level of integrity is outstanding from global leadership.

They do a great job lying to employees saying they value Diversity and Inclusion. They don't . I found out I was getting paid $30,000 less than other Associate Directors. They ask you to volunteer for the PBRG's and they are stingy in handing out Bravo Points for something that's almost like a part time job. The leaders smile in peoples faces and make decisions in back rooms . They care about the bottom line meaning the BMS Leadership Team not the people.

Zero accountability for any work. Want to phone it in, fail to meet compliance, lie and cheat and steal with no consequences- this is the place for you. Oh- and if you are a white male, promotions and money will just magically appear for you even if your performance is dismal.

Updated office building and cafeteria
Quality leadership is highly capable
BMS is a great place to work, they give a lot of vacation time/time off, they treat employees well and provide fair pay. Hybrid work schedule.
","required to work in office.
Work life balance could be better
For the uncomfortable part of this review is that unfortunately many notice site level ""founders"" that transferred from Celgene still practice behavioral bad apple tatics at site level through the roots of operation while remaining undetectable. They will manipulate, practice passive aggression in their favor in the shadows of the system and create roadblocks to site overall continuation of development which may also not be so transparent in the big picture. This ultimately will negatively effect the behavior of peers overtime. I truly believe BMS expected and accepted such possible out comes at time of merger but they may have not suspected it would go thus far. Will need attention.
Not always open to new ideas, especially when it comes to roles and responsibilities. An idea can be considered irrelevant one day and become an essential responsibility 1 or 2 years later.
The boss was an idiot.
I don't have any cons to report
It can be very demanding at times
Burnout is common and management will pile on more and more responsibilities to the point that does not seem realistic.
Change fatigue, lots of layoffs affecting culture
Interview process: Ripley is a new scheduling tool, and it scheduled for an interview but I was told it wasn’t a real interview. It was a phone screening, then I had a Teams one. I was told I’d be 1st, then 2nd, then 3rd shift.

Cell therapy's team culture is very clickish and management shows favoritism and if you are not in the favorite's list you will always be on the radar and expectations are now the same for everyone. Also, the team is very competitive with some team members stepping on other toes in order to get promoted.
Many of the individuals in the company don’t know how to do their job. Many of the new hires are very lazy.
Can be political and gets harder to move up when reaching the AD level.
Terrible culture, awful leadership- the worst in industry
- Not open to remote or hybrid for most roles
Low end of salary positons
Low end of salary positons
Future seems bleak in the midst of the incoming headwinds Constant restructure means constant uncertainties in job and outlook for everyone
Leadership tends to rely upon a select few to ensure the job gets done. There is some underutilized talent within the organization that could be put to good use. Managers being good can be hit or miss. Some are eager to please.
Career Growth concerns are prevalent
Lots of layers like most large companies
We just had an extremely mismanaged reorganization, preceded with 10mo of an unknown guillotine hanging over our heads. Instead of matching employees best suited for the new model roles using logic (performance over years and time in territory), senior management used an algorithm based on seniority in company. These 2 new roles, nccn health center msl and non-nccn msl, are quite different from each other. You would think that if you were assigned a role that was not what you are best suited for, and management agreed, there could be a period of shuffling since these assignments did not account for skill sets or career goals, especially since bms frequently touts how much they care about their employees, but you would be mistaken. The roles are final and your only option is to quit as the severance offered to your fired team members is not available. Needless to say- there will be attrition and poor morale for a very long time. You would also think that with a restructure this large that the territory size of the non-nccn msls and role assignments would already be in place, because this has been going on for 10 months, but you would also be mistaken. We have been told that this may take weeks to months to figure out so we have been told that there isn’t much to do until then..
Big pharma is sometimes about the money and not the patient and healthcare workers.
Lots of layoffs this year so morale has been low. Reliance on Accenture reduce quality of work. Leadership cares more about financials than the employees that have workked here for years. 50% wfh policy is outdated and badge tracking like we are school children.
Managers will stop your career growth within the company. Constantly understaffed for the amount of work they want done. Long shift and no concern for the amount of time employees spend on their feet in the lab.
Long work day and you will never just do your job description, you need to do a lot more of everyone else job.
No downsides that I can think of.
A lot of management layers when it come to decision making and escalating things.
not too many remote opportunities
Too Many Staff Layers Locations if you work home office
None so far, it's been pretty great
I feel just like a number
not very agile, slow to change
They have innovative and creative people but the culture is to be cautious in their decision making.
Need to improve the portfolio and pipeline
I did not see too many cons. Lunch is not free and heard it use to be before I came on.
Heavy anxiety no work-life balance
low salary no equity awards low personal employee value
Significant organizational restructuring underway. This has resulted in multiple jobs being eliminated and substantial uncertainty about what comes next across a large portion of the workforce.
Too many leadership changes. Very unstable org, lack of manager capability.
No downsides that I can think of.
A lot of management layers when it come to decision making and escalating things.

Long work day and you will never just do your job description, you need to do a lot more of everyone else job.
Don't value talent Political You need to know how to talk to succeed in IT
Many job cuts and job eliminations
Lots of red tape and meetings
Politics, politics, politics, and more politics
None to speak of...great culture.
Poor attention to quality and patient care. Visibly puts profits over patients. stereotypical pharmaceutical company that validates the negative and impression that society tends to have on the industry.
Layoffs are difficult when an employee is performing at a high level
Mandatory days in office and On call days is a must.
I did not see too many cons. Lunch is not free and heard it use to be before I came on.
No on-site cafeteria, which makes finding lunch difficult.
Promotions are very hard to come by so instead of going up the ladder making lateral moves will be easier to get higher on the chain. And although being a contractor is a foot in the door I would highly suggest working harder to be FTE from the beginning.
Realignments, culture is dying, gossipy managers
Overall working environment has become difficult with the idea of doing more work with less help that is typical in big pharma. Has gotten worse in recent years as has compensation.
I do not have any Cons
Poor leadership and little accountability
Limited funds to invest in people and tech Don’t trust leadership Too much innovation and change simultaneously Arbitrary timelines Disconnect from leadership on complexity
Start-up had a bumpy start
much too risk averse, and hamstrung by interdepartmental politics
Bad Culture in Cell Therapy
Questionable future due to key brands going generic and new launches have not been successful
Long shifts, No one is worried about how long you are stuck in the lab
Lack of touch with what IT wants Everyone from the bottom up to directors hate the badge studies and 50% rule. People proved they can work remotely just as well as in person, and the open floor plans are loud. People absolutely hate it, and many have left because of it. Your top talent doesn’t want to come in, or wants more flexibility to be remote, and you’re forcing them to go into an office where most people they work with are remote .. wow. What a de-motivator
Every thing was perfect for me
Significant churn in organization is causing a lot of stress for those employees that are left.
Decisions take a long time, layoffs and reorganization, changing culture
Remote work is limited unfortunately
Too many changes too often
Deteriorating culture, more work than staff can handle
They could pay people equitably. They could actually put in some leaders who have compassion and empathy. They should actually make leaders live in NJ instead of paying for the hotels and travel to commute from other states for their 2 -3 days a week in the office. They had multiple complaints about a leader for over 10 months from over 7 employees and HR did nothing about the harassment and intimidation. I bought into the BMS values but it's just on paper.
Work life balance, lack of simplified processes
Culture is relationship based can be overly burocratic
Unexciting work Middle managers everywhere with middling capabilities
Good or bad or maybe so
Slow to innovate. Need to seek out opportunities.
Lack of support, no loyalty to their hard workers
Dysfunctional leadership. Offshore work via Accenture and quality of work is poor. Bloated organization.
Frequently outsource and move locations
Every thing was perfect for me
Significant churn in organization is causing a lot of stress for those employees that are left.
Low pay Management changes every month Lack of accountability Understaffing Lack of progression Discrimination Sexism Abuse Toxic positivity Seattle is horribly understaffed and pays terribly. Leadership there is awful. Don’t get me started on Massachusetts and New Jersey. HR and TA are the most incompetent idiots in the whole company Cell therapy business has a huge quality and compliance issue. R&D lacks direction and leaders are abusive to their employees. Literally the entire leadership didn’t make their bonuses last year because the employee survey was so bad and their bonuses were tied to it. This is public information.
Remote work is limited unfortunately
Too many changes too often
Deteriorating culture, more work than staff can handle
A lot of work and not enough employees. A lot of turnover. Difficult to get promotions.
My job was resized and I was restructured to another part of the company. That's when the wheels fell off.
No remote jobs and small yearly pay adjustments
Weird shadow tactics for removing employees without warning.
Training isn’t great in my department.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Citizens-Reviews-E13640.htm,"Here are my top 5 reasons for working at Citizens: 1) Effective and functional leadership and teams: Work is prioritized and optimized to ensure we have the resources to complete the work. Clear and effective lines of escalation help us resolve blockers quickly to keep work on track or reset expectations. 2) Our Credo - Customers, Colleagues, Community & Shareholders: We do our best for our customers, communities and each other. It's not just lip service. Citizens regularly recognizes colleagues who go above and beyond in each of these areas. 3) Career Paths and Growth Opportunities: We are growing and getting better all the time. I've been here since 2005 and we have continually improved our products, processes and management culture. I've had numerous opportunities to work on different initiatives that has broadened my experience. 4) Work Life Balance: Many of us go above and beyond when needed to get things done and conversely Citizens provides a lot of flexibility so I can take care of the priorities in my personal life. 5) Feel Supported: The work is hard sometimes but I feel supported by my team, partners and leadership when I really need it. It also feels great to help my colleagues and team when we have a real challenge to overcome.
culture is nice and the environment is friendly
I started at Citizens in one of their Early Career Development Programs for recent college grads. The support I received from the colleagues here has been overwhelming, in my program and beyond. The program curriculum was thoughtfully designed to give us exposure to senior leadership and executives (including facetime with the CEO), as well as career guidance and experience rotating through many different targeted business areas before finding my permanent role a year later. I received support and hands-on-learning every step of the way. The program gave me career resources, such as a mentor, networking opportunities, formal presentation skills and experience working in cross-functional teams to complete a team-based project with other program participants across the bank's footprint. Having this support early on in my career made all the difference and has positively impacted my career, even today. Citizens' commitment to career development isn't limited to early career though, they provide you support for the lifetime of your career through formal and informal learning opportunities. Internal mobility is promoted and welcomed, with various chances to learn about new internal openings and teams. There are plenty of touchpoints to receive and provide feedback with your manager, with more structured conversations happening twice a year. Managers are encouraged to help build and support your growth plan and help you learn new skills. I'm incredibly happy in my role today and feel supported by my manager, the benefits and my amazing team. Everyone is truly so nice and willing to help. Whether you're just starting out, or have more tenure, Citizens is there to support your career development and growth both personally and professionally.
If one survives working at Citizens for long enough, there seems to be plenty of room for movement and growth throughout the organization. The facilities are very nice and relatively easy to get to. Lots of movement across departments, but most people seemed to be running away from something, rather than pursuing their next interest/role.
Everyone in the office is very kind and down to earth. Job isn’t too overwhelming and you work pretty good hours. You get to be remote 3 days a week. A lot of people have worked there a long time so you’ll get a good trainer. You can take PTO/sick time even as a new hire. You’re encouraged to ask for help when you need it. It is easy to take sick time when you need it and managers are very understanding of personal issues. I’d easily give 5 stars if pay was a bit higher.
Pay is good, benefits are good.
Love the culture and people. They are genuinely making an effort to provide a good work-life balance. Great top-down communication in terms of vision alignment and company goals.
You can develop valuable selling skills at Citizens and hone them. It is very possible to work in an exciting and upbeat branch with high morale.
Citizens is a solid company with strong leadership at the commercial banking level. The culture is strong and they highly encourage internal mobility and growth.

Strong commitment to Agile methodologies Supportive and collaborative teams Competitive compensation and benefits Opportunities for professional growth Emphasis on work-life balance
Here are my top 5 reasons for working at Citizens: 1) Effective and functional leadership and teams: Work is prioritized and optimized to ensure we have the resources to complete the work. Clear and effective lines of escalation help us resolve blockers quickly to keep work on track or reset expectations. 2) Our Credo - Customers, Colleagues, Community & Shareholders: We do our best for our customers, communities and each other. It's not just lip service. Citizens regularly recognizes colleagues who go above and beyond in each of these areas. 3) Career Paths and Growth Opportunities: We are growing and getting better all the time. I've been here since 2005 and we have continually improved our products, processes and management culture. I've had numerous opportunities to work on different initiatives that has broadened my experience. 4) Work Life Balance: Many of us go above and beyond when needed to get things done and conversely Citizens provides a lot of flexibility so I can take care of the priorities in my personal life. 5) Feel Supported: The work is hard sometimes but I feel supported by my team, partners and leadership when I really need it. It also feels great to help my colleagues and team when we have a real challenge to overcome.
Cares for it's employees and great place to work. Offers much for employees in terms of advancing own careers.
Time off was great because it included federal holidays and a graduated PTO plan (I left with 18 days of PTO). The management team for the ACH/Check claims department was phenomenal. It was a pleasure working there.
Hours not too bed relatively speaking

Flexible schedule, good PTO and medical

Lots of opportunities in technology roles and to contribute to exciting projects. The bank continues to transform to Agile ways of working and digitizing the bank. Great benefits, including generous vacation time and holidays Remote working available
I love working for smaller regional bank who invested in the growth of their employees. It gave me an opportunity to be involved in more high level conversations that shaped my confidence and urged me to be innovative in my role

","Growing and getting better is messy. There are periods of time where there is too much to do and not enough time or conflicting priorities. That's going to happen its hard to avoid when you are growing and improving. What is great about Citizens is that we address these challenges head on and work together to figure out a path forward.
upper management was very unorganized
Nothing I can think of!
There is plenty of talk about driving toward innovation and growth in public and collective forums; however, the decision-makers have limited experience beyond working at Citizens. Their limited perspective lends itself toward intimidation tactics and fear-based decision-making. If you have a degree that you’re proud of (or the desire to attain one) don't bother working here, many people at and above the title of 'Vice President' don't have a college degree. This - combined with the reality that nearly all employees are from New England - creates a myopic and close-minded culture, which is prone to stereotype other cultures and regions within the US and beyond. You will be expected to have an active status (a green checkmark) on your Microsoft Teams from 8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., which makes commuting a bit tricky, especially when your manager is working remotely, thus having an extra two hours per day to monitor the status of employees on Microsoft Teams...it also makes going to the restroom or grabbing lunch a bit difficult, so you might want to bring a colostomy bag and a protein shake to work. If you simply need a job, they'll probably have one for you, but if you are looking for fulfillment, career development, and a greater sense of purpose, then I'd consider looking elsewhere, pretty much anywhere.
Salary was lower than I was expecting. I have not been here very long, but I’ve seen reviews saying the typical bonus is only 1-2% which does concern me since I live alone in a high cost of living area. I have not been here long enough to receive a raise so I’m hoping that is inaccurate information.
Little to no training. Very archaic ways of doing things. No supervision.
I want to be able to earn more money.
Convoluted and often redesigned bonus structure that is always poorly constructed and encourages bad practices. Very branch specific experience as far as morale of staff and quality of manager if you work in-branch. You can and will be easily replaced at this company for somebody who will make less money and do the same work as you. The in-branch experience is often a fairly thankless job, with both customers and upper management capable and more than willing to have a negative impact on your day.
The HR process for any promotion or job change is always painful, takes up to 6 months in some cases to execute promotions. Title changes are very weird as well. And the policy on promotions and title changes is always under review or changing so nobody knows what is going on.
The downside of working for Citizens is not having a 4 day work week.
Too many tech platfroms that dont talk well to each other, Cumbersome processes.
Micro management and lack of professionalism from team
Can be difficult to grow in your career.
Constant pivots/changes in direction make it challenging to make progress. Lots of time spent updating executive presentations and positioning vs. actually getting the work done.
the only thing i can think of is the office needs an update
Location and salary low for living
Not too many downsides to the company.
Raises lag inflation last 3 years
None, liked every day !
Constantly changing the comp plan and not telling the staff until it was already multiple weeks/ months into the quarter. Horrible sales culture and there are entire branches that forge sales and do shady account opening practices for customers.

They pay so terribly, one of the lowest paying banks! They give horrible less than 1% raises even if you are rated as an exceeds employee. I worked for them for 8.5 years and made a whopping $4.14 more than when I started per hour even being promoted and switching roles 6 times! They shipped several jobs to India while sending emails to employees bragging about earnings and taking over other banks. They are greedy. In my many roles back office and branch they all had horrible managers. They have high pressure sales in branches, even as far as a regional a manger telling people if they didn’t get someone to agree to and open an account (sent people home with papers for out of branch account opening) over thanksgiving they would be fired or written up! They would make us stay to balance drawers and make us clock out because we weren’t allowed to get paid for overtime. Our managers told us we weren’t allowed to join the overtime lawsuit or we could be “reprimanded”. I gave a full one months notice, they wanted me to work at home for fear I’s convince others to leave, though I worked there for 8.5 years and had an exemplary record. I asked to use my vacation time my last week. I was told no, I’d just be paid out what they owe me and I could either work, or take off and my last day would show as the Friday before. I asked HR as my manger was just a jerk, and they said it’s up to your manager. An 8.5 year employee, with a perfect record and all exceeds reviews? With perfect scores on all my audits and tons of customer and employee compliments, and this is how they treated me! This is an overall horrible company and I do not recommend. Go to any other bank to work, they will treat you better and pay you double or even triple!
toxic office culture, no room or direction for advancement.
Not too many downsides to the company.
None, liked every day !
“Business” dress code is ridiculous for employees who are not customer-facing. Prior CTO was a power-hungry hot-head, but since he’s gone, I would hope things are better. This company lost a lot of great employees because of him.
I have worked here for 7 years. No cons its is great place to work at
Culture could be improved / mentorship
Work-life balance was nonexistent as a Charter One Branch Manager
Average age of a customer has to be in their 80’s. Colorado Life relationship
Nothing comes to mind overall
No cons off the top of my head
Very limited options for growth and poor incentive plan.
Base salary decreases after the first year and is gone after 3 years. Lead stream is usually smaller clients as the larger clients have all been taken by advisors with the firm that covered the territory while they were looking to hire.
cap on earning potential, four pillars philosophy garbage
There has been a high attrition rate since Covid, many experienced people have left which will require you to pay particularly close attention while you are in training and adhere to the PPM.
Limited remote work options Communication gaps between departments Outdated technology infrastructure Lack of diversity in upper management Limited career advancement opportunities

Level of stress will coinside with assigned department and affect work life balance.
The focus on productivity can be a bit over the top at times, but I understand the need to understand performance metrics and using it as a means for evaluating employees. There were times where it felt punitive to go above and beyond for the customer as far as performance indicators were concerned. Management never stopped me from doing so though, which was a plus.

working like a robot. They need to become more universal.
I can't think of any Cons
Agile transformation is in early to middle stages and depending on your role and what you are working on, you could find yourself frustrated by bureaucracy and politics.
I have no disputes or criticisms here.
Nothing :) I love citizens bank
You’re working at a bank as an LO, limited products
Moves slowly regarding innovation. Its a bank

There were no major cons to the company.
If you are a banker or assistant manager or manager, they push for sales very hard. And there’s a high turnover rate so you’ll probably be working every Saturday.
Can be very stressful. A lot of work.
With a MM Bank comes MM politics Tech is not where it should be Customer facing and internal
Nothing :) I love citizens bank
You’re working at a bank as an LO, limited products
Poor management Poor salary Poor culture Poor senior management
Not sales driven enough to pay their staff
Too many chefs in the kitchen. They spend so much money celebrating themselves that they leave nothing in the budget for innovation and creativity. If you voice anything that challenges their norm, they typecast you as a bad employee. Do your best to just stay quiet and play along . Not relationship based, just product pushes and raise goals unrealistically high. Turn over is a major issue , they preach “we promote a lot from within” but that’s because people leave a lot. So many meetings! Meetings about meetings, then a meeting to discuss what we met about.
Lousy management. Never helps when understaffed, sits in the office and watches everyone through the blinds instead. Any favorites do the same under the protection of the manager.
Thing moving slowly, instability in management level
Moves slowly regarding innovation. Its a bank
Said they would hire their temps, didn't
Lots of ""fire drills"" Not very diverse
Lack of any proper management or direction in workload. Very unorganized, and unclear goals. Lack of leadership trust, favoritism will get you further in your career rather than actually putting in the work and effort. Excessive work for poor pay, no appreciation, and lack of opportunity. The general consensus across the company is how horrible they treat employees daily unless you’re higher up in management. Creative thinking is not encouraged or rewarded. Very inflexible and antiquated views, not a forward thinking or progressive organization. Infamous for quiet firing. Frequent reorganizations across departments to cover tracks of mishandling procedures and workloads or continuous turnovers. If you want to work for a company with low morale and independence then consider a career with Citizens Bank.
Call center politics can be daunting.
Can be tough to implement change. It takes time
This place has gone from being a place everyone wanted to work at, to a place that no longer has value. Incentive plans get redrawn, are arbitrary, and do not pay you for your work. Salary is below industry average. Citizens has bought in and invested heavily on a vision that can't get off the ground, largely because they have made the choice to not pay those that do the work. Morale is exceptionally low. Productivity is low. Compensation is low. All of this is due to restructuring and restrictions of the role. This is a role that is not worth it in a professional sense they way it is currently structured.
Churn & burn environment with some less than ethical approaches from mid level management.
Low % on internal promotions, poor follow through on company commitments, poor leadership investment in employees
There are no downsides honestly.
Poor management Poor salary Poor culture Poor senior management

Bureaucracy. Disconnect between groups in same business sector.
Said they would hire their temps, didn't
Internal system interfaces Upper management (regional level and above) are not interested in knowing their employees or developing them for internal growth.
Cyclical nature of finance cycle Supporting business unit leaders can be difficult
Can be difficult to get meaningful pay increases
Managment is quick to blame when things are not going well, and quick to take credit when things do.
No work like balance. Unfair management treatment and unrealistic goals
Can be tough to implement change. It takes time
Short staff , limited help, makes it hard to progress
The product roles are not truly product roles. For anyone in the field, you will find this work far from what you are accustomed. Backstabbing culture. Top down.
Weak benefits. Odd strategic path moving forward
- No work life balance - No promotions - Org structure
There are no downsides honestly.
They do not offer competitive salaries
Like many companies a few bad apples can spoil the bunch and that was my experience at Citizens. Ego driven and self centered leader/s focused on themselves corrupted what was a good group of folks working to move the company forward.
High sales goals every quarter

great university, love staying here
Good working environment some labs
Free tuition (minus fees) for most full-time employees! Its a priceless bonus that I am fully taking advantage of. Working with academics is a fantastic, rewarding experience, and having the space - and full support of management- to pursue further education and training is very welcomed, and definitely refreshing after my years spent in the private sector. Its a rare (and worthwhile) space to have your work based on quality, instead of profitability or extreme speed. You wont find a 3 time doctorate - especially one willing to help you improve your skills - in the average office, these people know what they're doing and you can learn so much just by being in the same room as them and working on projects together. I would definitely recommend finding a university position for anyone starting out in their career and who wants the support to improve their skills, continue training/education, and also gain mentors who are so beyond incredible and geniuses within their subjects. Its also a great space for work/life balance. The main goals are to learn, improve the world, and share knowledge, and I attribute these goals to the healthy/positive atmosphere and the type of people attracted to these positions. So far in my career within this environment I have had zero encounters with domineering people who are only interested in being in charge (which was a common occurrence for me in the business world), so it is easy to take your time off, work from home whenever, and just overall have a very healthy work/life balance without ever impacting your work or career. Working here has definitely made me appreciate work/life balance and healthier mental health, neither were freely given to me in the past but it is easy and quick to gain here. Not an environment for anyone who NEEDS to be told what to do, though, you need to know how to do the work and how to manage your own time and tasks. But if you can manage your work and time well, you can be very comfortable on the average day and have a great work/life balance. My entire time here I have worked from home, they are great about hybrid work and letting people decide how they work best. It creates teams that churn out projects quickly without working anyone to death, and I have yet to meet a stressed employee in my office (at least any employee who is not in management).

The work was very interesting and fulfilling, and I learned a lot about how to work in a laboratory setting.
understanding for student workers and provide area to grow
Fast paced, team oriented, high acuity,
","While being a teaching assistant at the University of Maryland, College Park comes with many benefits, there are also some potential challenges to consider. These can include managing a demanding workload, balancing TA responsibilities with personal commitments, encountering diverse student needs and expectations, and navigating the potential for communication and coordination issues within large classes or across departments.
The school is poorly managed. The dean has a chief of staff who acts like a gatekeeper (think Haldeman during Nixon). Problems at the bottom are ignored by the top unless you belong to a small in-group.
Conditions vary depending on the department
High Demand and Workload: University counseling centers often serve a large student population, leading to a high demand for services. This can result in a heavy workload and potentially long hours, especially during peak times such as midterms and finals.
Wall is only open for a few hours in the afternoon - Not many hours Weather dependant
a little bit messy as we had to make our own schedule and plan in such a short amount of time before teaching
Once you join a research group, their labs and offices are not nearly as nice as the more public spaces.
While the pay isn't exceptional, receiving funding to pay for classes is great.
It doesn't pay well. And if you are staff - forget it
Difficult internal systems to navigate
Wall is only open for a few hours in the afternoon - Not many hours Weather dependant
Pay could be higher but isn't too bad
Little opportunity for advancement, pay raises are typically just cost of living.
- Sometimes lack of research oppurtunities - Sometimes long hours
a little bit messy as we had to make our own schedule and plan in such a short amount of time before teaching
I paid less than those who could support daily life.
Once you join a research group, their labs and offices are not nearly as nice as the more public spaces.
had to move in order to take job
No problem I really enjoy working here
It doesn't pay well. And if you are staff - forget it
None come to mind .
Depends on the class assignment, but grading burden can be high.
Difficult internal systems to navigate
The GA work you do might not be related to your career
The bureaucracy every step of the way stops any level of creativity you have, and university old building feels like a jail cell
Not a lot of hours to choose from
lots of annoying construction, lol
Some PIs are problematic, low salary for cost of living
Positions are usually based on grant money, so the salaries are on the lower end of industry averages and specific positions are rarely guaranteed for life, but you would never find this kind of flexibility, support, and education opportunities in the public sector. This is a great position for someone who wants to build their experience and prepare for the advanced years of their career, but I would not recommend it to someone who is there for the money and/or has no interest in quickly/vastly improving their skills or gaining experience with true industry experts. Also - to reiterate what I mentioned in the pros - this is not an environment for anyone who NEEDS to be told what to do, you definitely need to know how to do the work and how to manage your own time and tasks. But if you can manage your work and time well on your own, you can be very comfortable on the average day and have a great work/life balance.
Limits you from other workplace options, depends on your specific office
Limited chances to advance through the ranks
Limited Support professors care more about their research then graduate students
students can be condescending at times
Bad state, Liberal, bad location
A little more remote work would be good
None really. The health insurance and medical care are separate though.
None that I can think of
The PTO time at this hospital Acuures very slow accrue
Lots of work grading exams especially during finals.
none really, although the green line metro that took me to work was often down or delayed.
None that I can think of.
Too early to say but so far so good
Telework isn't encouraged as much as it should be. Especially considering how almost everything could be done virtually (as seen from during the pandemic) Salaries are eh - not much incentives or growth unless you leave then come back
Thee pay is not competitive, veery little chance for upward mobility.
The HR department of some of the institute work slowly.
Slow moving government job. Can be hard to get approvals.
This place is in need of a huge culture shift. Some of the things that take place here can be unsafe. Extremely short staffed.
Load flexibility is very limited
Unfair hiring practices. People are given promotions and positions and are not qualified for the positions. They are moved from one position to another position not based on their qualifications but on what was promised to them. Job Announcements are retro-fitted to the qualifications of the person ""Leadership"" wants to get the open position. It was a very hostile work environment to work in with little to no possibility for advancement. Employee retention is horrible, an entire department left the Institute. Lots of Nepotism- friends, family members, and previous firefighter personnel are given jobs because of who they know. There is no form of diversity, equity, or inclusion there. It's toxic. There is absolutely no confidentiality in terms of anything. The Leadership gossips more than the actual staff.
Having to live at work means being on the clock all the time, very standard for an RA. However, we were not given a stipend, only reimbursement, so if you had other bills to pay, you were SOL. Management was also known to not be receptive to criticism, and handled bias incidents very poorly. I wouldn't say it was a very supportive environment for POC, despite us making up a large proportion of staff.
I decided to move on to a higher position within the department. Now I report to the meanest person I've ever reported to before and there's been no support to stop the things I've been having to deal with.
Online systems are in need of update
Pay not high enough for experience
Low compensation, stressful work environment at times
each unit has it own rules regarding work from home be sure to ask .
Low salaries for graduate students (lower than some other university, like CMU)
All the construction on campus
Parking costs are very high Traffic to and from campus can be frustrating Construction is everywhere for the new public transit line
I cannot think of any downsides of this university.
Not to many that I can think of at this time
Not a permanent job, still have to move to the next step
micro management no communication lack coaching
I didn't really find anything that was a con
- sometimes unstructured regarding expectations for employees
-Working during breaks -Office politics
-wish the pay was higher
Infrastructure needs modernization. Needs to reinvest in a people-first centered orgnization
lower salary compared to industry
Parking is difficult to find, often lots of construction
Some weeks can feel longer, as grading dozens of student's work can be tedious and time consuming. Students may send emails at random hours of the night.
They demostrate distinct carelessness for their student body, driven to accoutability only when under fire. Insane and ongoing amounts of contruction

Cleaning up after other students
pay mangers not knowing their jobs
Work hours and Times are rough
New leadership and poor management.
Low salaries... can take a while to get promoted/salary increase.
every part of this is jhorriblw
Slow speed of human resources
Low Pay Annual 2% rasies every year NO work from home priviliges
-Pay is good for what it is, but not enough to survive off of -No benefits -6 month contracts make job security shakey
As with most governmental institutions, the administrative processes can be cumbersome & clunky.
Lack of parking in lots
some of the class material is old.
- Students can occasionally be a bit rude.
Pay isn't very high and no benefits.
-Disorganized depending on department -Too many people working from home, leads to lack of communication.
Still low pay considering the expensive parking ticket.
Like any large university, UMD has its share of bureaucracy to deal with.
Poor stipend. Also, note that you may not be able to get 6th year funding (happening a lot near me)
Might end up in a building with no A/C
Not allowed to sit down, even when STAMP is completely empty and there is nothing to do
As a student, I made Maryland minimum wage.
no cons for me so far
Location is far for me, pay, turnover

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Northwestern-University-Reviews-E3919.htm,"Good admin and helpful staff
• Great Coworkers. Everyone’s super mission-oriented, smart and resourceful. Really some of the most engaging, interesting people I’ve had a chance to work with in my career. • Great Students. The student body is also brilliant, highly engaged and genuinely fun to interact with. • The Campus. The Evanston Campus (and even the downtown Chicago campus) are beautiful. Everything you’d expect from a classically, collegiate environment. • The Benefits. Health, Dental, HSA, + tuition benefits are terrific (esp. for those with children or families to support)
I worked at Northwestern's Facilities & Risk Management Department as a student AutoCAD Designer and enjoyed the hands-on experience I got with using the software to contribute to the school's database of drawings and physically going to buildings for measurements. The role itself was very flexible and I was sometimes able to complete my work remotely. Everyone I worked with was very friendly and supportive.
Great teamwork in the ED. Everyone looks out for each other and is willing to help
Learned a lot about psych research
Easy work, good people, good benefits
- Looks good on resume
Lots of resources for staff, working towards better inclusion and transparent HR policies. Overall it's been a fun work environment. There is a good balance of staff leaving and staying, so there is often room for upward mobility but still staff with a lot of institutional knowledge. Hybrid work environment allows for greater flexibility and work life balance.

The work can be interesting if you're on a good project. My office was managed fairly well and I felt supported when I had questions. It's probably a good job to do before medical school as you'll meet med students and doctors.
You work with really passionate people that go above and beyond at their jobs.

Great Manager who really care
","Low base pay for grad workers
• The Culture. Very status conscious culture. I was routinely patronized, gaslit and condescended to by select faculty and senior-level leadership. • Work/Life Balance. Senior leaders lean on middle management to work excessive amounts of overtime. Everybody has a constant scarcity mindset, and yet there’s no effort to scale back program scope (lest students wonder where all their tuition dollars are going). • Institutional Priorities. The casual dismissal of the local Evanston community, the benefiting from (tax-free) real estate speculation, and the massive capital projects that have absolutely nothing to do with its mission (even as their staff and student workers are driven to distraction) overall signaled to me an institution profoundly out of touch with its environment. • Compensation. COLA (even in the best of times) rarely made up for the rate of inflation, so you can expect your purchasing power to decrease every year you stay in your job. Promotions will come with a one-time 10-15% increase in your pay, but usually at the cost of more hours.
As a work-study position, there wasn't much time for me to study while on the job.
Staffing issues and low censusing people too often causes burnout
No cons - had a great time
not a lot to do
- expectations always unclear - evaluation process unclear - benefits and salary scale unclear - general treatment of employees are poor - nepotism runs rampant - supervisors do not know the employees job so cannot define expectations clearly, train employees well, be supportive in the necessary ways - cheap with salaries vs. other places, especially due to how much money the institution makes - inflexible with time off and will still harrass you about work while you are out of the office, even if it's also unpaid time off
There are some inflexible work related policies (i.e. you need to be there at least 12 months to be promoted or apply for other jobs) they're meant to be fair but some situations call for individuals to be promoted faster (i.e. when an entire team is turning over and they wont promote the person who stays and takes on more workload). It's a large bureaucratic institution so it can take time for things to happen, everything needs multiple levels of approval.
-new employees work every weekend indefinitely. -poor management -mostly physical work
Overworked, lack of focus on DEI
- Technicians are paid via grants, limiting salary - Overtime is not compensated
Too many to list here
A bit far from Chicago but that’s what it is. Expensive food.
- PhD Students are not treated as employees (in the process on unionzing though)
- ungrateful people call and yell at you - sometimes you have to refer people and they get mad
Underpaid over worked, little recognition
There are currently no cons
Little to no guidance or onboarding from Northwestern departments beyond your supervisor. Very difficult IRB. Confusing HR deadlines and requirements.
2nd class treatment of clinical faculty
Low compensation, small merit increases, no communication, internal politics, silo'd business units, lack of support, no direction, little advancement, lack of accountability, lack of meaningful leadership, faculty and Sr. leadership egos.
Administration is slow, especially in the international tax office
Challenging since corona as most people work from home.
The pay is extremely low, management very disorganized with no sense of urgency. Management expects employees to do everything with NO help. The communication is horrible. Lots of favoritism and unfair treatment. No room for growth and there is always a blame game. The accountability does not exist. The gossip and acting superior is a major red flag. Managers only treat doctors with respect and empathy. They expect you to overwork and do whatever task they have been slacking on for the last 6 months. Micromanages and very condescending.
wish you could get curricular credit
Not many, just the application process was competitive but worth it in the end if you network with the right people.
No cons to report for now
Happiness can be advisor dependent. People burn out in some groups.
The shifts were quite tiring
Salary is not that high
University clinic is unsure if the priority is to make money or train students. There is little appreciation for the hard work of developing excellent clinicians and a lot of focus on billing patient hours. Time off is restricted to when the students are not in session which means no opportunity for summer vacations and getting time off (even for continuing education and medical appointments) is not guaranteed to be approved during the quarter.
None. I wish I didn't have to move.
Pay is very low coming in, inclusion and equity very limited, communication isn't very affluent.
salaries are relatively low compared to other universities
business school is terrible. they don't respect people.
The folks at the very top make too much money and it’s gross
The salary raises are minimal.
Micromanagement warning. Watch out for management who expect perfection and robotic-levels of work productivity. You will be written up time and time again even for the most negligible of infractions. If you prefer a balanced approach of work with personnel interaction and team camaraderie, ask about how it works with the team, specifically, before you take the job. My bosses were gone half the time and didn't realize/believe that team-building is something that humans need from time to time.
Pauline for sicientist were set by congress back in 1995 and have not moved since. Imagine being the most educated people in the world yet your government politician sets your salary equal to the starting salary at chip-fil-a or target.
Part time meant not enough hours
Climate is extremely toxic, especially at Feinberg PhD students are not respected.
business school is terrible. they don't respect people.

Cold winters, Program was too short

There are no research-related downsides.
I was a student worker, so sometimes it was challenging to have a flexible schedule, but the research group worked with me to make it possible.

low pay, pretty hard to move up
horrible pay with really no opportunities for greater raises. no access to the gym unless we pay for it (on top of everything else we do?), and no free parking for employees provided.
Little room for growth in my position. Study PI not organized and did not advocate for me to get a pay raise (despite team member leaving and I started doing double the work). No structured training
mediocre HSA health insurance, expensive parking or transportation reimbursement
During busy periods, lots of work that requires in-person attendance. Pay could be higher.
Gets pretty cold in the winter
Salary is only the Cons.
Less salary and visa sponsorship issues
Way too many hours and underpaid
Advancement within Northwestern is slow and often tricky
it has a cold wheater during fall and winter.
University positions are not the relaxed, no accountability positions that the general public perceives them to be. The pace is faster than one might anticipate.
Difficult to get things done due to the vast amount of departments and approvals needed.

mediocre HSA health insurance, expensive parking or transportation reimbursement
Expectations are high, some groups may often impose irregular hours
There are not a lot of cons that I can think of. I really like the program.
No contractual hours for teaching, office hours
Can be stressful for deadlines when experimentation isn't working properly. The transition from grad student to postdoctoral researcher wasn't as smooth as it could have been. Training on new protocols can be lacking at times, but it comes through in the end usually by making a small mistake and learning why the data was bad.
During busy periods, lots of work that requires in-person attendance. Pay could be higher.
Salary is only the Cons.
Not many cons except for hours can be long.
Less salary and visa sponsorship issues
Way too many hours and underpaid
Advancement within Northwestern is slow and often tricky
Pay is lower Small Team
Can't think of a con
Salaries don't keep up with inflation, peer institutions nor experience. In general, raises made in major tenure promotion years only make up for what you lost in less than cost of living raises in previous years. In recent years, this had made things very unstable, including lots of folks coming and going. Also, staffing is an ongoing and major issue, as Northwestern is not an ""employer of choice"" in the area.
The program is new so there is not a lot of infrastructure or support for students. There are not many individuals that are trying to make the program the best program because the individuals are working on other projects.
Financial management system is antiquated
No downsides for the most part
it has a cold wheater during fall and winter.
Part-time pay is pretty low
Poor management by the PI. A toxic work environment with low pay, but expect you to go above and beyond. Lots of micromanagement. Working hours fluctuate (none 9-5) No potential to move up the ladder at all, nor salary bonuses. The company will pay for your tuition after you worked 3 full years, and will need to continue your full-time for this to take effect (verified with HR).
- Boring, monotonous. - Not full-time
University positions are not the relaxed, no accountability positions that the general public perceives them to be. The pace is faster than one might anticipate.
Difficult to get things done due to the vast amount of departments and approvals needed.
Not a great option for remote work, even though whole days of work could be done from home. Your experience at this job will heavily depend on your department's culture. Some people get stuck on poorly managed studies and it can be stressful and unsupportive in those instances.
You need to be a person that is really passionate and goes above and beyond at their job. Pay could be better as well.
not much mentorship from above
Little room for growth, repetitive work
I do not have any to share at this time.
Expectations are high, some groups may often impose irregular hours
There are not a lot of cons that I can think of. I really like the program.
minimum wage, not a lot of pay
Depends on office culture and leadership style, but, can be 'unfriendly' in the sense that coworkers rarely socialize inside or outside of the office. This may vary office-to-office.
No contractual hours for teaching, office hours
Pay for research assistants is very low

GDIT really makes an effort to ensure that the employees are taken care of and have opportunities for personal and professional growth.

","I never had a bad experience.
It's contract work. Hopefully you can stay on if your company doesn't win the rebid. I would rather stay with GDIT than stay on the contact but that's difficult if there isn't a position for you on another contract or indirect.
Poor management and planning, unrealistic project deadlines, little caring for work/life balance, an attitude of the project comes before the people. Being placed in a role that is not in your skillset or not your career focus just to meet a project role. You are perpetually in job search mode as there is no ""bench time"" so if your project ends so do you! You are given up to 30 days notice and there is a half-hearted attempt to find you another project but you are pretty much on your own.
I don’t have any cons. Hopefully I will stay with this company for life!
This company is not too bad to work for but you may have to move around within the company to find a good position and good contract to work for. Otherwise you may be promised things that never happen or forced into roles that you did not choose.
Leadership does not have your back. Be sure to maintain your own relationship with the client, if your leadership is tighter than you, rethink your job/role. To survive get on your leadership's page, do not innovate, find out what they want and tell it to them. Have resume ready, keep other jobs inside GDIT and outside very warm. Employee Complaint program does not have your interests at heart; I filed 3 with substantial documentation to prove point, all sided with leadership. White Male, do not expect promotions unless you have multimillion $ contracts at the ready to book. Do not slip on schedule, if you have a legit reason, bury it and blame someone else. Employee retention/mobility is a sham, it is 99% dependent on the networking you have done on your own. If you enter the EM program, be ready to self relocate and take a pay cut by default.
No career advancement, they will lie about trying to get you a pay raise and blame HR for a year and a half, try to prevent you from taking full advantage of parental leave, will ask you to come in early during parental leave.
You will work massive amounts of overtime at this job. My boss was the biggest micromanager. She also was super pushy about asking personal questions. She was obsessed with having pointless meetings with everyone. I tried to cancel a weekly one on one once and she said “oh you don’t want to talk to meeeee :(“ She threw so much work at me that I was working 12 hours a day. I told her I was overwhelmed and she told me to work harder. STAY AWAY. This company does not care about you. I lasted 10 months! Never left a job quicker.
In terms of management, it's been a bit disappointing. With each new contract, there's a change in management, which makes it challenging to build a consistent rapport. It often feels like they're more focused on short-term goals rather than investing in employee growth. Self-advocacy becomes crucial if you're looking to develop professionally.
Strict talking rules, sometimes vague rules.
Pay, work is seasonal, working on weekends
They over-hired, taking in any warm body for years, and now are desperate to cull the herd--but they don't have the guts to actually do it and pay people severance and allow them unemployment insurance. Instead, they ""quiet fire"" them by passive-aggressively sidelining them in hopes they'll ""take the hint"". They don't care if they make people feel like disposable garbage as long as it's easier for them and good for the ""leaders'"" bottom line.
-Difficult to move up the ladder
Disorganized at times. Roles and responsibilities not always clearly outlined.
Uncertainty of contract can be a struggle.
A lot of information to learn in a short time
There could be issues with the contracts
As a gov't contractor a bit behind in terms of investment in employee development...technical yes...other not so much
Contract obligations hurt long term employment
I.T Roles don't pay that well especially if youre part of a big tieam.
Lower salary than expected, access issues (in my field) take a while
I feel as though my particular supervisor was adamant about making sure his people got promoted, rather than looking to push everyone upwards. Pay could be a lot better.
Senior leadership not understanding that they may be contributing to attrition.
Low pay for the job that is being done
It's the Costco of IT contracting. All PMs/managers are company men, you're on your own when it comes to interfacing with the customer. Annual increase is half of inflation
Pay could be better, and lacking in time off.
They are very litigious and don't have good relations with federal groups with whom they've lost contracts.
Many layers of management due to being such a big company, but it’s to be expected
Can get lost in the shuffle
GDIT needs to spend more time on interviewing, training, and evaluating their Managers. On the Tech side, the manager is often the techlead, or SME of the group and they have no people skills. This should not be a surprise as many tech people throw themselves into their work because they do not want to deal with people.
Rarely, there will be someone in a leadership position that makes the job less fulfilling or more stressful.
Little to no options to advance in career position, no mentoring opportunities, no opportunities for professional development of any kind.
So far I do not have any complaints
The pay base was low and yearly raises if they had them that year were low.
None that I can think of.
None that I can think of
- Internal job movement can be difficult.
Upper Management does not care about you.
No raises Low Bonuses Pay not competitive to national averages
Bottom of the line salary and benefits for experienced professionals who are new to the company, but have extensive work experience.
Very political managers did not train me well and blamed me to cover themselves.
It will vary by programs
career advancement for some positions are non existent. Especially in finance.
Can be demanding at times.
The job are temporary only
Less opportunities to grow in your career,
Contracting is nerve wracking all the time.
None to speak of right now.
Management sucks, gives false information
No time off, supervisors were horrid.
Tight security controls A lot of mandatory training
Pay is not great, and will hardly negotiate
N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
Big proponent of the 'good old boys' club. Leans toward a 'rockstar' mentality, i.e there's no patience for someone trying to learn a new skill. Internal mobility is a joke. No more than a feel good department. You're really on your own if your contract ends. HR is not supportive of employment issues. Raise a fuss about your treatment and you will find yourself looking for another job.
Lots of employees, easy to get overlooked
Can get lost in the shuffle
None that I have experienced in my time.
Little to no options to advance in career position, no mentoring opportunities, no opportunities for professional development of any kind.
No Time in half for overtime
I have not experienced any cons working here yet.
Was constantly on team calls
Overhead costs are too high which negatively impacts those doing the work. Good ole boy network is strong with the military O-6 and above community. Talent Management/Recruiters promote mediocrity and push out excellence.

Nothing special and nothing really bad. Would expect a better benefits package

Fired after 6 months for not having the ""right skill set"". Why did you hire me to begin with, then? Vague reason for firing. Weird.
None that I have experienced in my time.
evening work was frequent and you weren't paid for it.
No Time in half for overtime
I have not experienced any cons working here yet.
None really. Just going to depend on the contract you are working in for some.
Further away from Company flag pole as a DoD contractor
No cons I’m very happy.
You are simply a number and will be replaced as soon as someone with a lower salary expectation comes along regardless of your dedication to the company, commitment to your team or contributions to your division.
- Timecard confusion - Lack of professional growth (team was full, no empty positions to promote to)
Might be the best job I've had and afraid nothing will top it.
Hours and Pay we not that good
No cons at all working here.
There can be some irritating minutia such as multiple timecards, expense reports that are a pain to fill out and that you get little guidance for. The main con will depend largely on the customer that you contract for though. If they don't value contractors or have a lousy culture you probably won't have a good time. GDIT is usually willing to find you a job that's a better fit, but sometimes they don't have a lot of work in your local area.
Pay is a little below standard.
Contract obligations requires too many travel demands
Having a bad individual manager can make it difficult to succeed, but the company will generally recognize and correct this over time. Benefits are good but health is just okay Very large company so you can’t expect to understand all efforts occurring at the same time
Benefits and gov contract ya know
No cons come to mind.
Management sucks, gives false information
No time off, supervisors were horrid.
If your contract ends you need to be looking for a job on another contract. After my previous contract was recently renegotiated I had a choice of taking a significant cut in pay and change of title or offer of a severance package. I stayed and kept looking and found another opportunity that gave me my title and money back.
I think the pay could be better
A few upper managers that have no clue yet run things like they have it handled.....

A lot of obsequious behavior coupled with inconsistent and inefficient communication. I have experienced a significant amount of turnover since the holiday season, and the numbers are increasing weekly in the double digits. Unfortunately, leadership seems unfazed by the increasing amount of turnover. I can honestly say that this has by far been the most unsettling experience of my ENTIRE professional career. Unfortunately, there is no one to address these concerns with because everyone is under the guise of groupthink.

Competitive pay, telework opportunities, travel opportunities, empathetic management, career advancement opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs, a lot of diverse benefits, pension, and good work/life balance. Staff feels like they truly care about their patients and Mayo makes you feel like they care about staff.
My manager is amazing. My co workers are too.
Better pay, staffing, resources, and culture/vibe than any other hospital I have worked at or visited in AZ, by far. After 5 years at Mayo I can easily say my worst day at Mayo is better than my best day anywhere else. I was encouraged from day 1 to advance my education/career, with management working with my schedule and offering tuition reimbursement with no strings attached. Great pension program as well.
Pay, that’s all you’ll get from this organization. They will pay you well, but you won’t receive empathy, compassion, the feeling of being respected as a leader yourself.
Great, well known, prestigious, institution, with enormous resources, and opportunities
I was able to cross train a lot, I learned a lot.
My schedule is good as I have my afternoons off. The medical/dental/vision insurance is good but very costly. Wonderful patients.
Work at own pace and benefits
Worked with some of the best nurses and people of my career in the Surgical ICU.
Competitive benefits package and intellectually engaging.
Strong Benefit package Flexibility Growth opportunities Strong talent
Remote work option, pay raise with inflation

professional place, nice people, good mission
pto, benefits, education reimbursement, managers work really well with your schedule for school needs but it is a pharmacy and it’s going to be chaotic so if you’re looking for a place with downtime to study, this is not it. They have a ton of opportunities to learn how to do other things [Narcotic room training, IV room training, OR pharmacy training, etc] but the pay remains the same so you’re essentially better off just working as a courier without having to put thought into it. The pay for the other positions may be changing but it’s still in the cerebral phase of conception. I started off PRN, went to FT then down to PT for school through the CIP program [which covers 100% tuition in the accepted programs however be careful as this doesn’t mean 100% of the financial responsibilities. If your tuition statement has the word “fee” attached to it, it doesnt count as tuition so that makes YOU responsible for it. Realistically, it’s closer to saying “Mayo will cover 50% of your educational costs” or at least that’s what’s been true for me.]

When you have a heart attack due to the stress your job causes, you will already be where you need to be to receive treatment.
Treated well and respected daily by physicians, PA'S, NP's. CCM can be reached at any time and appreciate being notified. Felt my input was valuable. Supervisor was kind and helpful.
Benefits and pension for fulltime
Lots of OT available for any shifts
Rochester is a nice place to live, if you like small towns. You will never be fired or laid off no matter how terrible you are at your job. Automatic pay increase every year, but it does not keep pace with cost of living.
Benefits, teamwork, tuition assistance, supportive managers
The interdisciplinary team was fun to work with and everyone is willing to teach you.
Mayo does follow NIH guide line.

","Pay is not as competitive as it used to be
Health Care benefits are good, but Rx benefit plan through Alluma is horrible. Alluma barely covers anything and what they do ""cover"" is at a measly percentage that you have to fight for even if you NEED the medication (examples: insulin and synthetic thyroid medication). Raises are at a set rate for your ""pay grade"". You either get one or you don't and there is ZERO negotiating power for your pay once you are hired into a position. No matter how long you've worked in the position, how many degrees or certifications you get, or how much you go above and beyond. The pay is initially very competitive, but once they lock you in there is very little motivation to do anything but the bare minimum of what's required. The only way to get more pay is to move up in the company, which most of the time requires a degree.
If change needs to be made it takes years. people get away with out doing their jobs.
You are held to a high standard and slacking will be noticed and confronted, which is only a con if you are lazy. You will not survive here if you come in with a ""every man for themselves"" mentality, are rude/snappy to others, or try to take shortcuts.
The opportunity for growth is null and void, it’s all in who you know. Don’t get on anyone’s bad side because that’s all it takes! They don’t give you many opportunities to move around you have a better option to move out. For insurance purposes you can only see a provider at MAYO. Everybody else is out of network unless you do your homework, and at any given moment a provider can be snatched. Leadership looks down on you as if they are better than you, no one if friendly this environment is not one you’d want to work in daily.
Expectations in your role is commiserate with prestige of the institution
Being on your feet for long periods of time.
Negative work environment that management won’t do anything about. Favortism. Many people walking on eggshells in fear of retaliation or being called into the office because someone made up a story.
Lower pay and have to use PTO for holidays.
Rigid company standards that can be frustrating
Continually shifting priorities leads to inconsistent strategies week to week and month to month, setting unreasonable expectations for employees
Large Corporation Work life balance Parking NA NA
Very stress for job for the pay.
Overwhelming number of programs used, generalized not individualized training
Pay is relatively low compared to other
Pay Pct to patient ratio Nurse to patient ratio
Leadership is not back filling positions and leaving the responsibility to fall on others that already have overflowing responsibilities.
n/a there are no negatives here
I can't think of any
there are none i do not think
no room for moving up
personalities and favoritism, with heavy emphasis on promotion being placed on “keeping the peace” rather than moving forward but that’s mainly due to the overall pharmacy manager’s management style. The others do their best to appease the Head Boss, everyone works pretty hard.
Salary not competitive compared to similar roles at other organizations.
Too political - most leaders are all about themselves Actions do not align with values
The pay does not keep up with inflation. Pay does not match high quality staff performance and health risks staff meet and work with each day. Years of loyal service is not recognized and awarded. During the Covid pandemic and the ongoing inflation many felt the hardship this brought on. Many felt disposable.
Salary, a little bit more is necessary.
Hard work is required for this position.
Pay and benefits could be better - just as important to patient care team as clinical teams
*Not much opportunity for career advancement
Used to love working at Mayo Clinic, their value of their employees reduced so dramatically the environment became toxic and management or HR didn’t care

Hard to advance into management
13 years at this company in Florida and went through the worst treatment ever from an employer. Micromanagement was a real and serious issue in every department I was in. When I moved to different dept I was harassed horribly by Operations Mgr of previous dept to the point of reaching out to CEO. The culture was so toxic and the stress sometimes unbearable, it was difficult to trust coworkers. Even after leaving and finding another job, it is difficult to shed that toxicity.
Salary not competitive compared to similar roles at other organizations.
Mayo often struggles to be nimble and move quickly when needed. This is very apparent when there needs to be a review of staffing in a particular area. My group has been short staffed for over a year with a decline in level of service offered as a result. It is incredibly draining and discouraging to feel a complete lack of support despite continuing to plan and add more educational programs and more trainees, but not more staff to coordinate the new programs.

Lots of sick people it breaks you heart
Low pay Lottle to no bonuses
Health insurance could be better
Not enough space and often overworked
Any potential IT candidates, filter the Glassdoor reviews by job role and choose Information Technology to see the overall satisfaction amongst just IT staff. This will help you make an informed decision if you’re looking to change jobs. All reviews are accurate. Low wages, burnout conditions, backstabbing, lack of promotional opportunities. You no longer can just be promoted for working hard, there has to be a business justification and then the position will be posted for everyone to apply for. This means you have a bunch of coworkers scratching and clawing their way up. The result is people hoarding work, backstabbing others to make themselves look better and sucking up to anyone in a position that will help them get promoted. If you do get the “promotion”, you’ll still be making far less than others in the same industry. They say their health insurance is top notch, but it is far from that. You’d think that a large healthcare organization would have amazing insurance, but that is NOT the case at all.
Low yearly salary increase and difficult to climb the ladder without a higher degree of education
Health insurance isn't great. MN locations are not desirable. I have been here for over 5 years and I am still near the bottom of the pay range. every time they change the pay range the new employees basically get paid the same as people who have experience.
The PTO/Holiday/Sick Leave benefits are absolutely Terrible.
The heart attack caused by the stress from your job at Mayo will not be covered by the insurance that Mayo provides. When I started working here, I loved it. I was so excited and was literally taking notes so I could learn and do everything right. That lasted approximately six months. Until I witnessed our HR department penalize a coworker for coming forward about being bullied. She was written up for tardiness since the company’s policy is technically that if you clock in more than like 2 minutes past your start time it is a full days absence. However, that policy isn’t enforced and people are generally given 5 minutes of leeway. Luckily, my coworker fought back and they dropped that issue. Unfortunately, the bullying and immature behavior from HR continued (and is still present - in fact the worst offender has been promoted to a different position). The company has one of the most ridiculously strict dress codes that I’ve ever heard of. We have to wear a specific shade of blue shirt, black ankle length pants, and black shoes - no logos. It is actually WAY more detailed but I am not taking the time to list every single item. Naturally, it is hard to find things that meet these exact criteria. Of course Mayo has a store but it is only open M-F 8-5 in Rochester (not where I live or work). So not only would I have to drive an hour but I would need to take off work in order to shop for a job that barely pays me enough to get by and definitely doesn’t make me feel appreciated.
Slowly taking away staff resources. Sometimes feel like there's no help. Medical insurance is a joke. Especially if you see a doctor or get labs done here. Cafeteria is expensive. Grass wasn't much greener here, if at all.
Must have advanced degrees to move up
Transient workforce means people are only there for a few years
Mayo is a big organization so your experiences may vary. These comments are specific to Clinical Research within Mayo Clinic. Clinical research at Mayo is fairly dysfunctional. Most of the research leadership are from the Rochester area and have never worked outside of Mayo Clinic. The organization is very top heavy, with way too many managers looking to justify their salary by making up unnecessary policies and programs ultimately preventing investigators and study teams from doing actual research. This results in highly bureaucratic culture where feedback is not welcome. A rigid (almost military) hierarchy ensures that information flows through gatekeepers so nobody is held accountable. Read Catch-22 or watch office space for a taste of what it will be like to work in research at Mayo Clinic. TLDR: - highly bureaucratic - rigid hierarchy - limited opportunities for growth - out of touch leadership
Short staffed, floor full of travelers, high turn over
Growth is a bit more difficult if you are already not part of the field you are attempting to grow in. It is possible with social networking though and continuing to work hard!
Rochester is a small city.

I worked four 10 hour shifts, so those got to be long and not as productive. Overall lab vibe was mediocre. A lot of people kept to themselves. Management tried their best to do their job well but could tell they were burnt out because the lacked in communication with individuals. I ultimately left because Rochester as a city is not a place to thrive for extraverted people in their 20s & 30s. I ended up driving to Minneapolis almost every weekend just to do something. Mayo is great for a thriving career but outside of that, Rochester is a damper in my opinion.
The pay and benefits are not comparable to other places in minnesota
Strategy is going through its 2nd or 3rd reorganization in as many years. The culture of the department and the organization is not what it used to be. A severe lack of trust, no job stability, very low morale, disconnected from the true Mayo Clinic values. If you take a job, you are rolling the dice big time. Look elsewhere.
Some ideas can take a long time to get implemented,
being able to work remotely
Executive and Administrative Leadership only see nursing as an expense. Frontline management and workers are being used and abused. The Needs of the Bottom Line Come First! You know something is wrong when average nursing experience on most inpatient floors and units drops from 20 years to five or less in the past 18 months.

tons of documents to index and the rules to select the right document type are very grey which it becomes super hard to be judge by a method that is not perfect but they expect you to be. At the end of the day big companies will treat you as another number and this one is the exception.
Nothing negative to say about the company.
The schedule can be inconsistent.
It’s bedside. 12 hour shifts can be draining. Easily go elsewhere and receive higher pay.
Parking, difficult when working longer or evening shifts

Little oversight, been told by multiple managers that Mayo is a ""business"" and we need to do what's best for the business.
nothing that i can think of

Collaborated with some amazing teams of dedicated, very talented people over the years. SPGI believes in diversity. SPGI's CEO sets a very good tone in terms of best practices and culture. There is zero tolerance for discrimination or malfeasance. Reasonable flexibility for working from home and office. Most SPGI employees try to do the right thing.
Up to date technology, great teams, strong leadership, and always innovating.
My experience was exclusively on a greenfield project where I was one of the first people on one of the first teams of software engineers. It turned into the best software leadership experience I've had so far (after some hiccups, bumps, and re-orgs). The project was relatively isolated from the rest of the org, and has since been discontinued so YMMV, but the leader of the ~150-person project was really well-selected, and my manager cited them as the reason why he felt empowered to do the right things as well. IDK who hired the project lead, but they know how to pick 'em. People seem to notice if you perform well and seek more authority. Management seems like they're eager to seek out leaders and reward them, which can be good if you're looking for an opportunity to advance your career.
-Room for mobility - Growth fostered/encouraged - Flexible hours/locations
If you are an entry level professional with no experience in banking / finance, start here : they will pay for your MBA and you can then build your career switching to banking.
S&P Market Intelligence is really well structured and has very strong leadership across the board. Strong management, very entrepreneurial feel - the culture from IHS Markit is very clearly influencing everything about how the division works.

Great benefits, ton of time off and great culture that values it's employees
- Smart and (mostly) fun people to work with across the globe. I made some life-long friends. - Good benefits (6% 401K match, $500 wellbeing stipend, decent insurance options, HSA/FSA, wellbeing apps/resources), unlimited vacation. - Remote working options provide a decent work/life balance. - Decent technology systems/processes that are constantly being revamped/invested in, as opposed to some other older financial services firms that are still technophobic. - Some possibility towards career advancement (less so laterally if you want to switch roles/departments). If you take the initiative and have strong ambitions, there is a lot of cool projects and people you can work with here. The cross-functional, matrixed style that S&P employs allows you to work with various functions/divisions to push forward new products, ideas, and efficiencies/productivity gains. You just have to get a little bit creative!
Great benefits in addition to compensation
There are a lot of good people - I love my manager, have a profound respect for a lot of people in my org. These people do so many things right, it's impossible to list here. The benefits are OK if you're young and single.

Great experience working in IHS
Located in the Denver Tech Center.
","acquisition likely lost some company culture
The IHS Markit merger has been a substantial clash of cultures and competencies ... and is still unresolved. SPGI values cost cutting /bottom line over longevity and securing institutional knowledge, talent, and longevity. There are very few SPGI employees with 10+ years tenure. SPGI believes in hiring from the outside rather than promoting from within. Promotions are few and far between. Excellent internal talent gets often overlooked. Salaries /bonuses are not competitive with the rest of Wall Street.
None that I can think of. They embrace remote work and give all the tools you need to succeed.
Politics can lead to less-than-data-driven decisions, but I haven't seen it lead to downright malice or contempt (at least not at the level I was at). There were some long-lasting cultural problems during the duration of the project I was on, but I started seeing a pretty big turnaround from that in the months preceding the end of the project.
None at the time now
Promotion opportunities are inexistant. The company offers all sorts of benefits that look good on paper but the reality is that the compensation is so low compared to peers (50 % lower in average!). There is constant pressure to up the scores on Glassdoor (a portion of the company wide bonus is linked to the Glassdoor overall score via bogus employee monthly surveys). I recently left the firm and I was told that all my commuter benefits that I saved for would not be reimbursed. The supposed unlimited vacation (i was told by my manager that i could not take off more than 4 weeks a year off record ) is just a way to avoid paying departing staff for their unused vacation. Every dollar counts at S&P especially when turn-over is high !
HR are very corporate, bossy and overly structured. Comms the same. These are functions that came from the old S&P which is very bureaucratic and rules-based v. the sparky, creative, innovative leadership at IHS Markit.
None that I can think of
Constant mergers and acquisitions lead to constant corporate changes and over-convoluted leadership and team structure shuffles. New IHS market leadership seemed to demolish divisions as they were, laying off key leaders and legacy lived in knowledge. Not the way to handle mergers if you can't identify key figures to keep. Pay is underwhelming and takes years to get a raise.
Everything. Senior Management are completely incompetent and seem hellbent on running all experienced and knowledgeable people out of the company and burning the whole thing to the ground. The teams are critically understaffed, underpaid, and overworked. Yes men (Senior Management) constantly put us in bad situations by agreeing to processes that we can’t even come close to completing due to the staffing issues and constantly saying yes to clients, Sales, etc. with no plan, no hiring for the extra work, because they don’t understand what they are signing us up for, and then we have to deal with the consequences of their complete and utter idiocy. The culture, which used to be the best part of working at IHS Markit, has become completely toxic. WSO, which used to be best in class, is now a complete joke and I will be absolutely shocked if WSO is still in business in 5 years unless they get rid of the current leadership given that they have run every single valuable employee out of this place and now clients are starting to jump ship too.
Not a ton of strategic direction, quality of management could be improved.
hard to get a raise/promotion
low pay but not very exciting
Not found any wrong with this company
Cut throat. High stress. Lack of promotions and raises. compensation falls off after a while
The work culture and leadership is toxic. Very bad in terms of compensation as well.
pay could be better, too long to get stuff done
Corporate politics is really annoying
Compensate needs to be improved even though management says they will work on this. Hard to get promoted
Work from Home flexibility , return to office
Not found any wrong with this company
The work culture and leadership is toxic. Very bad in terms of compensation as well.
Company culture is not the best, a lot of company politics involved (with certain groups, not everyone)
work culture work life balance not a priority depending on team
There are new products being added to the mountain of existing ones everyday. Been with the company over a year and still don’t know all we offer. Company is so big and complex it can be hard to find answers quickly when working across divisions. Upward mobility is limited & it seems like people sit in limbo roles waiting for spots to open on teams.
Set deadlines without talking with team members or at the planning, and does not allow team members to share their expectations and it is all what leadership say. So much pressure and no appreciation. Focus on overseas reassures and less on employing from the U.S.
Not too many perks after salary and bonus
There can be a lot of bureaucracy and paperwork. Lots of selling your vision in, reporting on the progress, etc. but to a degree where one can end up talking about the work more than doing the work. It can be easy to burn out, or be burnt out; this goes unnoticed by management.
Work from Home flexibility , return to office
Covid layoffs were made and were told that was it, but more were made and went back on their words.
With growth in any company, there are always changes. Just continue to consider employees with that growth.
Just okay place to work
Pay, dull work culture, limited funding for opportunities like travel
Depends on the department. Certain divisions can use better trainers as opposed to expecting us to figure out “self learning” techniques to solve issues that developers struggle to solve,
Merger is messy, internal operations restricting true potential.
Compensation Comparison against other Banks
More clear promotion structure and growth opportunities
Big company so change takes time
People aren't held accountable when they slack off. Like with most mergers, people started to act negatively
Jobs can be very simple and boring
dated systems, poor upper management decisions
Pay is not ideal for the amount of corporate relationships maintained and compared to other companies. It's not a gross underpayment but enough where you would probably start looking for another role after 2-3 years
Too many levels of approvals
The management was not up to par with the company
Limited opportunity for career development
corporate hierarchy can be difficult sometimes
Bad culture. Upper management abuses employees.
Raises are minimal unless you get external offers
no cons as of right now
not sure if this is the case for other positions, but lack of formalized onboarding/training
Can get lost in the machine from time to time.
- Because of the highly matrixed environment and the company's size, there is inevitably plenty of bureaucracy and the decision-making tends to be slow and inflexible. It's great to have a democracy with various opinions to make group decisions but sometimes this results in way too many repetitive calls with too many irrelevant/uninformed people who only end up blocking the obvious decisions from being made to maximize their own advantage. The balancing struggle for dominant power often backfires and holds the company back from new revenue streams. - Given the size of the firm, there tends to be a lack of accountability and some buck-passing that takes place rather than fixing of the underlying problems in the existing systems and processes. - Not enough technical resources (i.e., developers, designers, etc.). There is an endless list of priorities on the product/tech people's plates so you are constantly having to go back to the bitter client to tell them the bad news that we had to extend the deadline on a fix/enhancement or a new product launch. - Excessive overhead on the commercial/sales teams which have too much liberty and influence, often proposing projects that have not been signed off which sucks up time/resources and thereby impinging upon proper product innovation and growth. - Pay is below market and one of the reasons I left.
More people than required for IT applications
My organization had a bunch of people transfer/reorg in from historical-S&P, and their competitive nature and career focus has noticeably diminished our culture's health. Multiple occasions where senior folks will have 1:1 conversations with MDs/VPs and come back with ""their approach, which management favors"" -- then will hand-wave their way through broad strategy or program organization. There's a ton of cross-talk sowing confusion on the program level. Back when we were just IHS Markit, I swear our culture was more focused on doing right by stakeholders, and less on personal optics. I miss being able to gather 360 feedback and just show how my reports operate at a higher level. Any-time promotions are GREAT, but forcing people to become a salespeople and personal-brand managers, do legwork, and write a ""promotion stories"" about themselves is terrible. Downright toxic to anyone who is not a career salesperson, and reinforces the wrong kind of thinking. Also be aware the medical benefits are poor if you have a family / are trying to start a family (insurance has high costs and high out of pocket max, IVF not covered beyond a few thousand from medical insurance).
Honestly none that I can think of.
salary is quite low as per market standard
Consulting is trying to emulate McKinsey while paying paltry salaries in comparison Will do anything to sell a project even if execution is unrealistic or flat out impossible Little guidance, senior management is too busy to help execute the projects they sell and it falls on the junior people to figure out how to execute extremely difficult work Questionable ethics, a lot of essentially copying other sources without attributions
sometimes feels like internal competition
Not many downsides, I enjoy it
- Very large company makes you feel lost in a sea of people - Annoying restrictions, such as no recording of meetings, constant re logging in to things
- Extremely underpaid - A LOT of overtime. Expect to work until midnight every month end and quarter end - Tools and Resources are very dated and slow and makes it difficult to do daily tasks - Super high volume of work to do daily - Very high turnover. Most people leave after a few months from burnout and teams have to cover for months - Little to no growth opportunities
Because of its size, things can move slowly, whether its organizational changes or product innovation. Lots of internal politics.
Bureaucracy that can be expected of a company this size, but oftentimes was mind numbing, and too much to handle.
Very disorganized after all acquisitions
Salary was a bit underwhelming
Can feel like steering a ship when making meaningful change
Managerial and organizational uncertainties following merger with IHS Markit
HR team was too big
Large-scale offshoring to locations with cheaper labor
pay not many hybrid would rather remote
Nothing specifically for me it's good
Need to work many days
Like with any merger, organizational structure is rather fluid and often lacks follow through. There are times when support is needed and not always available.
A lot of layers and roles in the commercial organization. Can become confusing.
Sometimes hard to get attention and promoted.
Weak client base, tough to get new clients in the door
Compensation could be more competitive to the market
Your experience can be great. But not likely if you are in the Dallas office (formerly Markit). The management has constant turnover and expect an unfair work-life balance out of their engineers. It could be different on the non-technical side.
Slow growth Very low increments
All of the obvious challenges that come with legacy companies
They do not offer the highest salaries in the industry, they try to make up for it with outstanding benefits and a strong culture/flexibility.
While they will put on a caring persona, upper management is actually very numbers focused, rather than a people first approach. They will underpay you per industry standards. Upper management is also severely detached from the day to day, leading to their perceived ease of the role and intentional understaffing.
Per-merger, S&P was a great place to work. Very rewarding, both financially and mind stimulating. After the merger, at all changed. Left in the dark this year about compensation, became very ""top down"" and clearly they have their ""favorites'"". Room to grow is almost zero. Product quality going down as people are leaving. People are just a number now.
Pay not as competitive as it could be. Transitions during recent acquisitions and divestitures have been a little chaotic but handled well overall.
constantly focused on bottom line which creates an unhealthy work life balance and team culture
No cons that I can think of for my particular role and situation.
Low Pay comparable to job duties, you receive little training, poorly managed from the top down, people will position themselves to look better at someone else's expense, a lot of sandbagging goes on amongst various teams, you will be thrown under the bus at some point, high stress working environment
Did not feel opportunities for growth were available unless you were well versed in office politics versus quality of work.
Corporate environment, wait long for progression
Very global. All Time zones. Hard to have meetings
Tend to care more about the bottom line than the people.
cant think of anything right now
- Management gives very few resources to employees - growth, comp, learning opportunities - Company culture is awful - office is almost always a ghost town - Company platforms are abysmal - CapIQ is the worst across all data providers
Pays slightly below market, but overall great company
Average pay, could be better Big company slow to change direction
The IT teams are pretty slow at implementing changes and the companies systems are pretty old in some areas which makes it hard to enact change.
Total Compensation is below industry standards. Lack of career growth and development. Large corporations mean it's more difficult to implement real change.
More pay transparency and parity
This company is one of the old, salaries are not that great based on silicon valley standards
After 23 years of dedicated service and low pay S&P decided to lay me off with no warning! What else can be said!
"
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Rutgers-University-Reviews-E22285.htm,"-Allows you to expand your experience with customer service -A lot of downtime to catch up on classwork
I've worked here for 20 years and I love the staff and community, as well as the students.
- A lot of the shifts are desk shifts, and though its not advisable, you can do some work while serving as watch. - Pay is reasonable, always slightly more than minimum wage, and you get promotions at a decent pace (i.e. you can keep the job through all 4 years and get paid more each year, if you push for the promotions). - Hours are reasonable and you can choose to work a lot or a little. - Co-workers and leadership are usually pretty great to work with and more reliable than your average college job.

","-Harder job to get as an upperclassman
There's this lady i don't really like.
- A lot of shifts can be super boring and last up to 8 hours in a completely empty building. - You are mandated to do all the football games, unless you have a really good excuse to not attend. It could be very cold, rainy, windy, etc... and its really all the same. These shifts can be a little tough to get through. - Only ""useful"" for post-college if you plan to go into the public sector, as it gives a bit of rapport. Especially those interested in policing, but that timeline can be much longer.
Parking lots tend to fill during high peak times on campus
* Have to move positions/units for pay to increase. * Pay doesn't lately keep up with inflation/cost of living * University-level leadership more concerned with main campus.
Nothing to really report on for cons
Typically pays less than industry, moves slower, more bureaucracy
Getting the job was pretty hard.
They pay the minium wage but it's an on-campus job
There was not a lot of growth potential.
All work depends upon grant. Hard to get grants. Low pay. No holiday for researchers.
Salary and culture depend entirely on what lab you're in
There are not any cons to speak of.
Hard to grow- once on the salary ""scale,"" it is near impossible to get a bump in title or salary.
boring slow redundant not entertaining
Hard to find a job.
Sometimes uninformed about the tasks
Pay for the equivalent in the same field is on the lower end
Constantly shifting priorities, competing priorities, too much work without enough resources, staff, and support
No health care benefits for us
The connection with industry still needs to be improved
the pay is not that good for students
promotions can take long time
Do not have any cons at this moment
Still requires multiple side hustles
Short staffing; lack of communication from upper management: Union still doesn’t have a contract; big org changes to come; old systems that create problems for both staff and students; worried hybrid work might go away
its not bad just a student
You have to be selected to get in
no disadvantages can pop out of my head
so much bureaucracy, sometimes you don't get paid on time, super high cost of living area for such a low wage
Crappy facilities Academia bureaucracy No room for growth
students often uninterested in the material, can be difficult to keep up with TA work along with your own classwork
The system is terribly difficult to work with. Lots of bureaucracy. You hit red tape at every step in almost every process. Lower level staff is often frustrated because they don’t understand how complicated the system is. This often leads to a difficult dynamic between leader ship and staff.
Not a enough staff, you have to pay for parking space.
Can get boring at times
Worst part of academia is the low pay
Low pay or good pay depending on who you know. ""Type casted"" at your title. They pretend you don't know anything past the job title which are designed to limit on paper what people actually do. Lots of territorial bureaucracy. Don't hire many people that are trained at the university, which is telling of its faith in its own educational system.
Sometime you might be doing data entry
- Administration will do everything they can to not pay employees a living wage
The bar can be a little low
Not a enough staff, you have to pay for parking space.
Terrible management. Did not here from my manager more than 3 times when I was working for about 4 months.
Can get boring at times
Upper management doesn't understand some of the lower logistics and problems we run into and they expect things to change at the drop of a hat.
The pay was very low.
Hostile relationship between unions and management.
Lots of bureaucracy and very little upward mobility.
Sometime you might be doing data entry
Being a state school, Rutgers is a bureaucratic nightmare.
Money centered, this company would be amazing if it actually focused on client care like they say they do. UBHC does not care for employee wellbeing or work life balance. Caseloads in outpatient are overwhelmingly large and intake coordinators are often overwhelmed. Evolution to improve the workplace takes 5x as long due to red tape. Also do not pay or help with CEU's at all.
The bar can be a little low
Hard, you have to lift a lot of heavy things.
rough hours, experience depends on management
Pay is kinda low but most students aren’t given much.
No Room for growth, you are replaceable
However, was just difficult to make a living on low wages. That's the nature of most grad work, though...
Management micromanages, poor communication. Most of staff is nice, but some gossip issues.
- work can become repetitive or even monotonous
- administration is strict - unequal pay
Very common overtime works with high pressure
Area with high living cost
Not much to say about cons, pay could be better
There's nothing negative to report
BEWARE - RU Advertises REMOTE WORK but is extremely ANTI remote work.
Negotiations take a long time
No cons Work during game days
Labs spread out over multiple campuses, not as much interaction with other universities in tri state area as would be expected
Pay is less compared to the work given.
Need to provide more room for growth
low salary as compared to living costs in NJ
Administration and Leadership are horrendous. Everything is so disorganized. It’s like the blind leading the blind. Without the union the school would treat us like slaves making barely liveable wages.
Not many cons to complain about.
Must work in building no remote options avaliable.
The pay was $11/hr but the work wasn't that hard so I guess it balances out.
So far so good learning experinces
It is supposed to be group tutoring but there is never really another tutor working with me on the same subjects
Salary is an issue at every big employer.
No cons that I can think of
hard to get students/postdocs insular culture between departments
It's disgusting how many executive-level staff are married to one another. Now it makes sense how some of them acquired their titles and salaries. Some executive staff are wonderful and support all who they work with, but some will plant lies and manipulate others to benefit their spouse. But they execute their manipulation in a way that demeans and berates others. Simply look at how many employees leave Rutgers-Camden for other opportunities at other Rutgers campuses.
I don't have any negative experiences.
Honestly can’t think of any
Being a state school, Rutgers is a bureaucratic nightmare.
slow processing time for paperwork
Money centered, this company would be amazing if it actually focused on client care like they say they do. UBHC does not care for employee wellbeing or work life balance. Caseloads in outpatient are overwhelmingly large and intake coordinators are often overwhelmed. Evolution to improve the workplace takes 5x as long due to red tape. Also do not pay or help with CEU's at all.
On the other hand, having a bad PI or a bad lab culture can be a miserable experience.
It’s a small team so I’m the sole worker and get overwhelmed by the amount of work and responsibility I have.
Hard, you have to lift a lot of heavy things.
rough hours, experience depends on management
Need to be on campus
No Room for growth, you are replaceable
Nothing to complain about, all good
Long delays in project administrative approvals and staff employment contracts
I was demoted from a lead tutor to just a tutor my last semester of college without given any reason as to why that was the case.
Recently got a better salary outlook due to strike. Hopefully the salary will be improved.
There are no downsides worth mentioning.
- Limited time for breaks - Overwhelming supervision at times
Graduate level and entry level faculties were constantly underpaid. the minimal increase in salary never beat the increase in living expenses.
None, the best place ever
Communication with advisors or managers can be poor at times. They also change protocols for what assistants need to do very often, which can be annoying.

In my case, it was flexible work hours, good work-life balance, and interesting work. Also, MIT provides access to professional development and unaccredited learning, which is not only fun but turned out to be a huge asset later on. Benefits. Plus retirement for those who manage to stay over 10 years.

","Depends on the project to how much organization there is to each team.
Does not include some benefits like dental insurance.
-Every department/lab/center is its own island that can run however it wants. (This was a con in my experience, but it could be a pro, I suppose.) - Litigious employer that takes concerns about disability or equality as a threat - Surprisingly disorganized with tech systems considering its reputation - Incredibly high-pressure environment where things that no one will remember in a month are treated as a true crisis
Low salary for the area, but it’s a great I vestment in your career
low salary, not a real job
Not as high of a starting salary as I would have liked.
Can be bureaucratic at times
Unorganized, needs better structure and a higher salary base for motivation
high cost of living in the Boston area
Fast-paced deadlines, must be flexible
not much opportunity for developing range

Can be bureaucratic at times
high cost of living in the Boston area
Mandatory 2 days in the office
Fast-paced deadlines, must be flexible
Can get boring and you might have to find ways to stay busy
the compensation reflects the typical academic standard, which tends to be on the lower side.
it is very stressful but still handballed
UROP Direct Funding sometimes short
Range of work opportunities is limited and pay could be more competitive
Could increase pay more, but pats well in comparison to other higher education institutions
Hourly is Massachusetts minimum wage
research pay isn't the best for Boston rent
The salary is lower than at a company
It's hard to advance as an administrator
heavy workload and a low stipend
Sometimes hard to find your way because so decentralized
- HR sucks at doing things on time. Took 3 weeks to get a badge, couldn't start till a week after I was supposed to, and other weird administrative bottlenecks.
Nothing is wrong here. I love the campus.
Project can take a lot of time to finish sometimes
Salaries are not the greatest - Cambridge is expensive!
Students love tech, but they don't focus on the underlying problems of the issue they are trying to resolve.
Mandatory 2 days in the office
Information can be an overload at first.
Can be bureaucratic Trades “mission” motivation against pay (comp is decent but not the highest) Entrepreneurial culture can also be frustrating - difficult to coordinate
Toxic work culture, everyone one is very supportive but quickly all-nighters and sacrificing health for work is normalized.
Compensation is low relative to the cost of living in the area.
Difficult to grow, pay could be better
there are no downsides here
Information can be an overload at first.
Work/life balance is a struggle specially with overbearing advisers. Salary is not as high for the cost of living in the Cambridge area.

The disparity in benefits to fellows (with their own funding) vs postdocs fully paid by their PIs is shameful
Confusing & a lot of parallel processes
salary not adequate for level of education/training
Commute, Really nothing else was negative.
There are no cons when working here
Living in Boston is to costy
relatively low salary, high pressure
Not as much support as peer universities
wish to be in undergraduate
Lack of social skills can be hard
I have nothing negative to say
The pay is very low, bonuses and raises are almost non existent
Benefits don't come close to Harvard's, and having an ombudsman is a long way from having a union.
High expectations and can be stressful.
Pretty stressful to work in
The bar is high. The salary is low.
Not as diverse as they like to claim. Often the only black person in the room
no room for promotions or growth
admin and management is challenging to work with
Employerrs are paid well, competitive,
I did not have any cons working here
None that I can think of
Not many. Salary is a bit low to live in Boston

Not as diverse as they like to claim. Often the only black person in the room
no room for promotions or growth
Limited opportunities for advancement without a PhD, limited salary appreciation
admin and management is challenging to work with
I don't think there is/are any cons here. Just that the postdoc salary isn't good enough for savings which is already a well-known fact.
struggles with diverse hiring, but is taking steps to shift that
Employerrs are paid well, competitive,
A lot of opportunity for growth
not that much opportunity to grow
Hard work hard work and more hardworking
Experience is highly lab dependent
This is usually a temporary, grant-dependent position. Like a graduate student or a post doc, your life quality will depend on the faculty / lab you work for. Talk to them. Talk to their students/post-docs/other researchers before going in. See what the culture is like.
Faculty rule. Professors don't make good Administrators. Average salaries. Anemic raises (2.5%-4%/ year). Second largest endowment and stock market returns in the area (Harvard is first) don't trickle down to employees. Inconsistent WFH policies (do as I say not as I do). Managers side with PIs over staff. All credit/recognition is focused on them rather than their team who really do the work.
It can be a lot of work for not much pay, and you need to be self directed
Limited advancement opportunities. Near political monoculture.
- no career growth - pay isn't amazing compared to industry
Upper administration doesn't value our work Stipend doesn't keep up with inflation/cost of living in Boston area Harassment and bullying run rampant at MIT with little recourse
No such High expectation Expensive
None, None, None, None, None
Parking situation could be better

You are constantly meeting with people of all races, genders, ages, and backgrounds. The people really do make or break each store. Growth opportunities are abundant. Certain stores really try to promote the best workers from within. Bonus potential on profitable stores is incredible.
There are many full-time workers who care about what they do and who they work with, they value the relationship between the full-timers and part-timers and work to achieve the most efficient workday, creating a fun but hardworking environment.

Friendly co-workers. If you're full-time, the benefits are decent. You grow with the company. Every day is something new. You will talk to a lot of people and garner a following of companions. They have charities, funds, and donations regularly that you can apply for. Your social skills will be put to the test, if that is something you are looking for. If you are ambitious you will have opportunities for growth fairly quickly compared to other jobs.

You meet a lot of great people that are around the same age as you, particularly if you work as a high schooler part-time. After that, some coworkers stick around and work while they're home from college while others don't.
","Schedule was sometimes difficult to change
Yearly raises are consistently 2-3%. Doesn't even match cost of living. Luckily, you don't get to leave the store enough to use any of your money anyways. Inconsistent hours. I started in the company at a time where moving up meant more consistency and more benefits. Yet, every promotion was met with worse hours and less time away from the store. The store management turnover was horrendous. In my first five years I had one store manager. Over the next five years I had six. The tenured professionals in the company seemed to lose their ability to provide customer service. The employees who had been there for 5+ years typically sat behind a computer or stayed in the backroom for most of their shifts. The amount of infidelity within each store at this company is crazy. More people were let go or removed from their position due to having affairs than poor performance.
Senior-level management degrades the work of its full-timers, using inappropriate language and jokes that provide an uncomfortable workspace to their employees. Customers are objectified and hard work is rarely appreciated, instead power tripping over employees to bring morale down. Senior-level management seems to have little idea of what goes on behind each department, not knowing what is best for the store and making erratic decisions without the department or the customer's best interest in mind.
A helpful smile in every isle- all of your employees are underpaid and many are struggling. You can barely find a decent place to work here, so HyVee seems like a great option. Until you meet all of the upper management who do not care about you. You are a number to them and while your bank account sinks, theirs grow. Aside from that, HyVee only cares about the money they make. Jack up their prices and get people to be robots for $15 an hour. Don’t ever get sick, have an emergency, want to take a mental health day, etc. The good managers are there almost daily, while the others sit on their salary and think of others as if they’re worth nothing. It’s hard to work in this town and like stated before HyVee is one of the places in town to work that isn’t a factory or fast food, but it’s not worth it. The bar is so low that anytime a manager actually does their job they are praised like no other. Walking around with a duster in your back pocket nagging 24/7 is a better idea to one than actually wanting to help his employees.
-Good ol boys club, operates very old school -values how long you have worked at hy-vee over experience (this is a direct saying from pervious ceo randy) -favoritism -watch your pto, had a problem of some vac time being paid out, never got the actually money for it even though on paper it says they paid -micromanagement, this comes from all the from the top -upper management doesn’t own up to mistakes -is not honest with employees - took away employee discount, then brought it back but employees can only use it once a week(10% off), this is a joke, on top of that they were trying to tell employees that other places don’t give discounts, haha that’s hilarious cuz it’s not true -department managers get blamed for upper managements mistakes - terrible compensation -takes advantage of good working employees -too many hands in the cookie jar -useless positions at corporate office -low pay -store managers can tell employees how to take their vacation time, HR and/or upper management does nothing. There are store managers that will ONLY let you use your vacation time in week increments
*Added stress on pharmacy with endless gimmicks like transfer promotions, fuel savers and coupons galore. Regional management makes completely unrealistic decisions for those of us in the trenches while they never have to deal with their decisions. *The customer is always right, even when being abusive and or threatening. *No raises. 3% cola is considered a raise. Terrible. *Seniority does not exist. New hire gets the same schedule as longest term tech. * Company couldn’t care less about your dedication or hard work *’Employee Owned’ is a joke. You get some stock but no say in anything. * Unresponsive management/HR with abusive employees actions
depending on position, hours can be cut or shorter than usual
When no managers or cake decorators are present, you are expected to write on the blank cakes.
Lower pay than other places
Tedious work at some points but still not bad at all.
Tend to go home an hour early
Management can really make or break a job. I worked with great dept managers who made work fun and I worked with some terrible ones on an ego trip.
You end up having to do everything. Management has an unrealistic list of things to do, plus doing the list of things you already have to do plus serve customers
Customers are allowed to get away with disrespectful behavior to employees unfortunately.
Management would micromanage, making the days more hectic than needed to be.
Workload can be spread thin across dozens of tasks
Not enough hours short. Breaks
Repetitive work and great groceries
Terrible upper management. Lack of care towards part- time workers. They removed our discounted grocery benefit to increase company profit. You will be overworked for very little pay. Department heads are consistently overworked and will take their anger out on their staff. You will be forced to perform tasks outside of your job description.
Everyone had an attitude all the time
They hire a lot of people (and a lot of high school students that are working for the first time), so it gets pretty disorganized. This is usually a pro for part time employees since the job is really easy and you can basically do whatever you want. The only time that it's a con is when you need to rely on the other employees (training, scheduling, etc.) Personally, it was never a huge problem for me because I would just ask around and older employees would figure out a makeshift solution. The other con was that one of the HR ladies was really unhelpful and always angry for some reason, but I don't think she works there anymore.
Tough balance with family time if you’re full time. Pay still lacking
Low pay and hours were really strange.
Not a lot of growth opportunities from this position since restructuring.
Management cares more about money than people customers are rude
Some co-workers are terrible. The pay is honestly not great at all. I was part time scheduled full time alot and did not get paid well at all.
Took away the discount over one person
To many new managers there
Becoming more corporate and less service oriented
Sucked to stand for hours straight
Store management can be frustrating.
This company went downhill under a certain CEO and only seem concerned with artificially holding up their internally traded stock.
Refuses to give benefits for full time work, and complain to you about government requirements to give benefits(Bro, I want benefits) You work overtime a lot and randomly. They’ll call you in at the most random times. They’ll say you are “part time”, but it’s actually 40+ hours. Customers are sometimes racist and garbage human beings. You’re not allowed to call customers out on being dicks. Manager will sometimes reward bad customers with free stuff. I’ve witnessed customers be racist toward coworkers. Coworkers have been working there 5 years for 12/hr and I was getting 14/hr as a new person, which felt horribly unequal. After witnessing horrific discrimination against a coworker I quit the next day. They tried to bribe me to come back by offering me a promotion(WTF). When I refused the bribe they proceeded to threaten me with “if you quit then we’ll never hire you again”. Sounds good to me! It’s one of my worst working experiences ever. I highly do not recommend to anyone.
I spent more and more of my shifts out of my department as time went on. I felt more was being expected of me without any offering of more compensation. It blatantly appeared that less was expected of some employees and they were exempt from doing certain things. I felt taken advantage of for being a dependable employee who could perform a lot of different tasks. I felt management was in disarray and some people probably shouldn’t have been in positions they were in. The place had no flow or consistency in it’s operations. High turnovers added to this. They won’t give you a heads up if they change your schedule either. Good at making groceries complicated.

Tough balance with family time if you’re full time. Pay still lacking
To much favoritism for certain employees, hours.
Management can be questionable, not getting the Starbucks benefits- like coffee beans or shift drinks, understaffed frequently
unprofessional workers and management, no work-life balance, rushed training, during the interview they'll talk you into working for a position you didn't apply for. They'll cross train you in different departments with no wage increase.
Work-life balance was not ideal.
Hours are cut a lot.
They were great with my service dog but got weird when I would miss a day
Rude management and bad timing.
Constant change to the online shopping processes, usually pushes by corporate. Changes didn't help in most instances. You're just a worker bee to some members of management. Just a number to get the job done.
More corporate everyday Micromanagement Crunch on hours when not necessary
Was not a good long term job.
have to be very communicative
just that we are new having growing pains which are normal

Relatively low pay I thought compared to many other retail jobs
Bonus percentage for part-time workers half of what full time workers receive for the same position.
Sometimes have hard/bad customers, pay raise very slowly, not much to advance to
Not a lot of room for growth without relocation
-Easy to get left behind -Other stores seem to have dysfunctional management due to a lack of hiring.
A lot of call ins. Left short staffed
I spent more and more of my shifts out of my department as time went on. I felt more was being expected of me without any offering of more compensation.

Not much training involved Can get overwhelming during the holidays
Near two high schools, so there were lots of high school students, which results in high turnover, but the majority of students I worked with were kind and responsible. Management was mainly OK but a few managers were simply not suited to working with younger people, often being condescending or downright mocking. There were often scheduling issues, especially around graduation. At the time, the schedule was ONLY posted in-person (this may have changed, but managers then refused to send a photo in a group chat) which made it very difficult for those who did not have cars or a friend on staff. As you can imagine, this often ended up in a mess.
The actions don't always match the words
Hours are cut a lot.
They were great with my service dog but got weird when I would miss a day
Constant change to the online shopping processes, usually pushes by corporate. Changes didn't help in most instances. You're just a worker bee to some members of management. Just a number to get the job done.
Young workforce that can be lazy, poor management organization
Was not a good long term job.
have to be very communicative
Some deliveries are extremely hard on your body because they are so heavy. Tipping is never expected but, with the low hourly wage, it would be nice. Didn't have many tippers. Lots of orders to take and seem to have little direction on what is the best way to complete deliveries faster. Customers could be rude to you although you were not the one to shop the orders.
just that we are new having growing pains which are normal
High, often unrealistic expectations Overworked at times Not enough tools or resources
Boring Hours are inconsistent Surrounded by vices, not good for anyone tempted by gambling, alcohol or cigarettes
No cons I can think of
Relatively low pay I thought compared to many other retail jobs
Bonus percentage for part-time workers half of what full time workers receive for the same position.
Sometimes have hard/bad customers, pay raise very slowly, not much to advance to
Not a lot of room for growth without relocation
job is repetitive, so can get boring
Bad management in most depts
-Easy to get left behind -Other stores seem to have dysfunctional management due to a lack of hiring.
You're upper management will be a mess of young, clicky tools who will kiss the butt of the next up in line while throwing you under the bus. This butt-kissing is very prevalent throughout this Company. You're Job will be very physically demanding They will call you up and expect you to check and bag while other departments get a pass. You will NEVER get a thank you. Hard work doesn't pay here. You will get no help as store managers will cut your labor costs, so it will end up being you and another part time associate to work trucks. You will always be behind the 8 ball. Corporate will send you (pawn off) garbage product with zero chance of it selling. It will expire and you will throw it away. Thousands of dollars of product weekly will get dumped. Your product will most likely be 20%+ cheaper at Walmart, making your 10% discount worthless.
High turn over rates, some managers don't communicate, sorta over worked and under appreciated at times it seems like 1st & 2nd shift forget about 3rd shift sometimes.
Pay isn't the best, Lack of help depending on store
liars dont listen overwork you managers get lazy and have service managers do everything
Limited breaks No employee discount
A company culture of ""customer is always right"" means employees often feel unsupported when customers are rude/escalate their frustrations.
Some department leads can’t handle stress, but they usually don’t last long
The actions don't always match the words
Work weekends, pay could be better.
Your poor, your co-workers are poor, and even your boss is poor.
Many hours in the freezer
- - - - -
The culture is not the best Often felt like you are just following orders and not a part of the team
Difficult to please anyone on either side of the counter.
- Management at the time was a little unorganized for this position
Finding shifts that work for your schedule can be challenging at times
Young workforce that can be lazy, poor management organization
No cons for this position.
Aisles online can be stressful dealing with multiple orders at one time.

","I don't have any cons
none, i work with the best people
NYU (school of medicine) doesn’t value their employees. Terrible PTO policy, does not pay your out for unused and carryover time. Long probation period of six months. No continuity or standardization between department. A lot of disgruntled and unfair treatment.
You're over worked. If you don't give your soul to the company and the work you do your seen as a terrible worker. Even if you out perform everyone. Supervisors and managers are constantly up your butt demanding you do more work and do your work faster. If your found talking to another employee (doesn't have to be in the same department) your supervisor will break it up and advise you to focus on cleaning more things/ areas since you found time to talk. Management and union DO NOT stick up for you at all!
Upper management does not support junior management, thus creating the perfect breeding ground for hardworking employees to get burnt out; bullying and encouraging a “high school” like behavior amongst some in junior management. Upper management in corporate systems does not work efficiently to address concerns of employees. If you dare speak up about what needs to be improved you might as well put a target on your back cause upper management will find anything to get rid of you.
Alot of growth within but they like to hire outside.
Charge nurses need to attend training classes
Not any thing to complain
micro managing of all employees
Management sucks and better off feeling like a drill sgt
Nothing bad to say about the interview process.
Can be busy at times

Like most medical facilities there will alwaysbe some level of seniority when it comes to working with 20+ years coworkers.
Not having enough staff can be challenging
micro managing of all employees
There is not much of a con
Very strict work policy, non-unionized nurses need to well behave.
Management sucks and better off feeling like a drill sgt
Needs updating/refacing and some structural issues
Leadership is very lacking and scrabbling a lot. they seem to not know much about what happens on the medical/ surgery floors or the policies within the department. there is a lot of turn over in both management and social workers. there is a lot of pressure, favoritism, and unfairness. Work distribution is not equal. no training but just shadowing already overwhelmed social workers. its a good start or middle career for a social worker but not long term. there is high burn out due to lack of support and cattiness.
None that I can think of
very large and sprawling organization
short staffing, bad ratios, negligence, abuse towards workers from patients
- salary is not great but still acceptable
non-union, unfair assignments for float nurses
Poor staffing and toxic work culture
None at all great place
Very metric-driven, leadership only looks at your performance based on meeting numbers. No support for staff and leadership will protect those in management no matter what.

They will always put profit first over anything. Employee health, patient safety will always come second if they can make a profit.
Toxic work environment in the dept. I was in. Definitely affects your mental health day to day.
Difficult commute if live outside the city.
resources can vary by division
Recruiters and leadership can prevent you from going to the next level. Doctors and nurses are set in their respective fields, but in other departments, you need more than just an undergraduate degree and graduate degree to move up. At NYU Langone, they advise you to enroll in these totally useless administrative support courses and they still will not hire you an administrator/manager role. To advance, I must already have management experience, be well-connected, or just wait for a management member to pass away or retire.
Can’t use benefits because can’t get days off Repeatedly get denied PTO requests
I work a bedside job.
There are no cons working at NYU.
Not many remote jobs available

Not many remote jobs available
No cons I can think of
You don't tap into any human resources jobs the work culture is extremely toxic no room for professional growth
Unless you’re planning on retiring here, the 1199 benefits are frustrating, annoying, and inadequate. Few providers accept 1199, almost no dentists do, and there is no behavioral coverage at all. Customer service is atrocious but if you can find providers who accept 1199, it’s really nice because there are zero co-pays and zero premiums. The hospital is in disarray on the floors. The staff has been chronically understaffed since COVID and a former abandoned medical floor has been converted to take difficult overflow cases from the main campus. These patients are very challenging and are almost all holding for nursing home placement. Most units have managers who are manipulative and who are bullies. My own manager likes to target anyone doing anything wrong, often petty things. He talks about fostering a “just culture” but is quick to assign blame creating a toxic work environment. He also is severely lacking bedside experience so he is very unsupportive to the outstanding work we do.
Bonus and base pay is low compared to outside New York City
Management can be rough depending on department, no room for growth
Management is very uptight and nitpicky about things that weren’t a problem the last month
No WFH Short sighted management
Low pay unfortunately, students deserve more
Management is often unprofessional and not well versed on protocol.
Lots of metrics to handle
None that I can think of
Not encouraged to further education Not always fairness amongst staff and management
Always remember to go to HR if someone ever make false accusations about you don’t hesitate.

Low pay shifts can vary
very long hours weekend hours
Unfortunately it went bankrupt and closed.
Sometimes I had to work holidays and weekends.
There was some confusion of the job title, when I first started. I thought that my job was to watch the customers and monitor all of their activities. I followed on lady home and within hours of sitting outside of her house I had the cops called on me. Turns out my job was to ""Stock"" the shelves. The police weren't very understandable about the situation, but in the end I was able to keep my job.

Underpay , short staff long hours
horrible customers, very entitled and blah
Working with the public sometimes.
The pay was not great.
Worked lots of hours, management was a bit strict
Low hours and low pay
Can be slow if it's not Christmas season
The pay was terrible as a key-carrying supervisor. Hardly making much more than seasonal hires with tons of responsibilities and stress on top of it all. Due to the massive debt that Toys R Us became saddled with after Bain Capital, Vornado Realty Trust, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought Toys R Us bought it in a leveraged buyout, the company went bankrupt and over 30,000 people lost their jobs while the investment firms made millions.
High employee turn over. Low Pay.

","Work life balance can be tough - you will be stretched thin sometimes.
Work life balance can go for a toss quite often!
For outside MBA hires, this place is a nightmare. There's very little training. They tell you they want outside hires to bring in new ways of thinking about the role. Unfortunately, they are mostly run by people who grew up within the company and they get frustrated that you don't think exactly like they've been trained to. A high percentage of outside consultant hires get put on probation because they don't think and perform exactly the same way that consultants who were hired as associates and promoted twice do. Those people have received extensive training and been self-selected by the company two additional times.
- Good luck with staffing - Only rewarded for doing similar project types. Those who do the same work for same team get promoted quicker - Managers say one thing, do another
Long Hours Time Zone Differences
- Say goodbye to W/L balance... - You won't know what managers exist or projects that might be right for you. You are put on projects more than given opportunities to learn what exists or in the pipeline. Whatever comes your way, you pretty much have to take it. The good managers will give you the option to take their project or leave it if you don't feel it is a right fit.
Expect a poor work / life balance. Forced in-office presence which factors into reviews. Lack of up-or-out structure results in many complacent / incompetent people stuck at the middle-management levels. Title deflation and slow promotion compared to other consulting firms. Recent overall budget cutbacks for raises, perks, and office events due to over hiring during covid and refusal to do mass layoffs. Low motivation to perform anywhere above average, as there is no additional reward for great performance.
Work life balance is very difficult, with lots of pressure to take calls early in the morning and late at night. Most of the team is coming from similar country/community and feels a little bit like a high school click and it's difficult to fit in if you are not part of that community. They often speak in their native languages even when others are around.
Pay is inadequate for HCOL and VHCOL. Very long promotion time-lines. Experienced individuals or those with advanced degrees are brought in at AC level.Not all managers are alike and some tend to have only technical skills but poor interpersonal and coordination skills. Like other consulting firms, the staffing process is fairly disorganized, attrition is high, WLB is poor. Onshore-offshore model can be very challenging given all the technical work is done by teammates in a completely different time zone. Work culture and professionalism standards are very different (and potentially conflicting) among people who worked in one country for a long time as compared to those who transferred. Not a streamlined process to get certifications - learning on the job encouraged. Onshore work tends to be limited to project management, coordination, client communication, internal communication. Inadequate use of project management and task tracking tools.
• Our relationship to clients is reactive vs. guiding them to understand where the industry is going. • Old school view to work-life balance and mental health • Culture clash between off-shore team, toxic and tensions • There is not praise or trajectory for moving up • Managers don't have any real influence - strength in numbers is the only way to get things done. • No hiring visibility for mid level hires, you don't ""meet"" your direct manager before they are hired. Folks making those decisions are so far removed they don't understand the proof points we should actually be aiming for. • New York office folks are rude and need training on how to be inclusive

- toxic culture where you are expected to work 15 hours a day along with weekends. - No technical growth in onshore teams. - A lot of internal politics with almost impossible to switch teams
Sometimes policies made it difficult but still worked out.
The same as the rest of the industry - long hours (unless you go part time) and high stress
Demanding. Fractional staffing makes for very little work life balance
Must come to office 3 days
Very competitive and a lot of pressure to sell projects You better know your stuff Expect to work long days and have to start early every day, as there is a lot of interaction with offshore resources
Big company with a lot of undocumented processes, hard to navigate sometimes
Very bad work-life balance, creates a nearly 24 hour long stressful environment. Managers will overwork you then leave you with a bad review.
Not necessarily work that feeds the soul.
Not great for people not interested in healthcare
hard to find your footing as a lateral hire
Less vacation & PTO than other firms
Some managers are not fair to others and ruin the culture
Long hours | No concept of personal time for some superiors | No 401k matching in the initial year(s) | No stocks |
- work gets pretty dense into pharma world
Clients generally do not follow business hours
Changing team is not as easy as you want Promotion can be slow compared to other firms Work life balance is difficult in consulting
Some managers are not fair to others and ruin the culture
Company offers decent pay only because they put you on multiple projects, stretching capacity way outside of even 150% utilization. Almost everyone at firm complains of toxic work culture with no work life balance.
not many projects on non-pharma
- work gets pretty dense into pharma world
Poor culture and slow growth
Clients generally do not follow business hours
Changing team is not as easy as you want Promotion can be slow compared to other firms Work life balance is difficult in consulting
dual staffing model, offshore teams,
-inefficient staffing -puts employees on PIP for every little thing with no hope to improve since your project teams and PD coach will constantly give you negative feedback and belittle everything you do. No recognition on improvements whatsoever, just constant criticism to the point to make you quit. -Toxic and demeaning project teams and managers who have no interest in your professional development
Experience is project-dependent and can sometimes be bad Bad work life balance
Let me start by saying this is the worst job I have ever had including side high school jobs. There is no work life balance - it’s just work. I have had tough projects in the past but I have never encountered the situation where there are truly not enough hours in the working day for the project timeline. The principals are paranoid and lead by micromanaging and are surprisingly more involved than they should be even at the AP level - talking to the level of slide X should say this. I know consulting in general is tough, but because they don’t have brand recognition and still operate with a small firm mentality - there is absolutely ZERO leveraging of prior framework, processes or methodologies. Which on its own would be fun and exciting, but throw in extremely aggressive / just asinine timelines and it becomes setting up teams for failure. This is the type of job and company that makes you realize no amount of money is worth not just your mental health but literally purchasing every ounce of your life. I would RUN. Toxic culture.
Not the best projects and engagement
- Lack of support across levels - Lack of diversity (barely any African Americans or Latinois)
Client facing role; work life balance
Work life balance and culture
Poor work-life balance. Some stagnant projects. Relatively low base pay and slow progression within CIG space specifically.
relatively poor pay and boring management
There are some very toxic teams Lower pay and raise slower promotion cycle
A few bad apples, but they don’t ruin the whole batch.
None, really none. Just none. Nothing bad.
Sometimes work load and work life balance gets bad
Everyone who was on 2+ project(s) complained about the long hours, but ZS definitely over hired because many of the people in my cohort did not get their first consulting project for several months, if they even got a project at all. The layoffs due to ""poor performance"" after not having a single performance review was also a lie since there were not enough consulting projects to go around
None to discuss at this time
work life balance could be better
Advancement opportunities for admins is limited, but possible if you can advocate for yourself. Must build a business case in order to be promoted to higher levels.
none that i can think of
fractional staffing is challenging, oversell projects with tight deadlines always lead to burnout; night calls with offshore team is the worst
Feedback process is hard Fragmented staffing can be painful Lack of work culture, coworkers don't want to get to know each other
It all depends on the department/people you work with
High pressure to prove your worth and sell business
Pay, Review Structure needs improvement
No cons that I can imagin at the moment
I don’t have anything bad to say
Can have long hours due to internal ways of working
Not great WLB as always
Terrible work life balance Projects can get kind of repetitive after you are aligned to a client/space
Can be hard to get the work you want
not a lot of support
1. Long hours are there for sure 2. Recently a lot of people were hired during covid so you may get staffed in teams where people and offices are new and the core ZS values might be missing, as the growth was sudden and not organic
- As a new joiner staffing was very sparse and there wasn't a lot of structure in place to get new joiners involved especially in the virtual environment - Weak talent management and professional development at lower levels
Longer hours. Restriction of traditional 'consulting perks'.
Long hours and intense work culture
- Pigeonholed into Pharmaceutical work (which yuck) - Long hours - While most team and people are good to work with, some of the bad actors go unchecked, so if you're on a team with them it can get ugly (yelling, unprofessional feedback sessions, unreasonable hours, etc.) - Changing culture takes freedom away from the worker
Training and staffing could be improved; ZS is more aggressively performance managing people out of the firm
Work life balance Unstructured work
WLB can be terrible, project choice can be abysmal and the staffing partners are quite bad
Staffing teams can be challenging
- Poor work-life balance (highly dependent on project deadlines, client demands, and how much your project managers care about you not burning out) - Sometimes disrespectful clients (depends)
Poor onboarding Nightmare to get on a project Lack of organization
Worklife balance is little bad because of multiple calls in a day.
- Work life balance - Politics
401k match is sub par
A lot of unstaffed people currently Some being being CO’d Management not that great

You have to find the right team of people to work with. Everyone works hard here, they are inclusive, and approachable. They want you to grow and succeed. The trading desk head worked hard to get me hired. I moved internally from a different role, different function, and higher job title. A Senior Trader is mentoring me so that I understand what’s going on and how to do my job. I try to add value wherever I can and my team has been very open to improving our processes and new ideas. Work from home flexibility is good.

great work life balance. nice people.
They are really strong in corporate banking but their investment banking team is incredibly weak.
- People ridiculously kind and caring despite obviously having busy schedules themselves and make sure to make summer analysts feel welcome - Culture especially in EQD so welcoming and friendly and global - A learning experience but also a way to network, with good possibility of going to full time after graduation - Rotation on minimum 2 desks to give you experience across Global Markets (from EQD to Fixed Income) and across job roles (trading, sales, structuring, etc.) - Hours are not extreme like IB, but pay IS comparable - Seems like everyone will find their place somewhere, as there are quantitative roles with structuring vs more client-centered soft-skill-needed roles with sales vs more stressful and slightly math roles with trading
Plenty of vacations Good Insurance Good work-life balance
Management hide in their office and collect their paycheck. No team building effort.
Very nice culture, good team work
Love the people here, everyone is friendly and collaborative
stable job (depending on immediate group) and comfy environment for those who don't prioritize meaning of work

","Management was all over the place
Gaslighting managers, they lack leadership abilities, they don’t have clarity about what they want themselves, bad mouths employees who they take an instant dislike to, ruining their reputation all around, close minded employees, cliquey, rumors travel faster than light there, low compensation, lack of growth, everyone thinks they’re the experts at their job when in reality, they have a lot to learn, employees are not really valued, the culture is tone to intimidation, managers can quietly block your growth, no use reporting to HR, callous attitude towards employees’ wellbeing, mean-spirited people in general
If you are a Human Resources professional, proceed with caution! The HR Department has the right roles but the wrong people in these roles. BNP Paribas is a big proponent of employee mobility—however, insufficient due diligence results in the wrong people mobilizing into other roles—this is catastrophic when these individuals are in leadership roles. All skills are not transferable. Like other professions, Human Resources and its extended branches, from payroll, benefits, recruiting, and compensation, are specialized skills. A stellar performer/decision-maker in one business unit or role does not make a stellar performer/decision-maker for another business unit or role. A company is only as great as its Leaders. There are some great Leaders at BNP Paribas. A Team is only as great as its Leaders—this is where Human Resources is severely lacking. I am an active employee of BNP Paribas. I have been an HR professional for close to twenty years. I've seen it all! For the first time in my career, I filed an EEOC complaint against my employer based on the practices I've witnessed in Human Resources. If promoting the unqualified is going to be the continued practice—it absolutely should not be, but if it is—mandatory leadership coaching should be required when individuals transition into these roles. Human Resources touches every stage of an employee's career cycle. When Human Resources cannot lead by example because of the ineptness of its Leaders, you cannot expect others within the organization to rise to the call of Leadership.
If you are a woman of color, do not go to this company. They will underpay you, discriminate you in the most insidious ways. Worst, if you complain of discriminatory treatment, they will not resolve the issue at the management level and rather put you on a black list to find ways to get rid of you. They will retaliate with your performance reviews, they will harass you through your management, put you in a non-promotable situation. Worst, if you are unlucky enough to be pregnant they will let you take your leave, however when you get back they will remove any meaningful tasks from your plate. So much so that you will have no other choice but to leave. This is a bad company, they think they are part of the big banks in 2023 but they have a backwards culture from the old continent: sexist, racist and silencing any form of challenges.
Very slow systems and cross team coordination.
Roles changed to different departments
A bit bureaucratic in such a large organization
Limited work-life balance: Although BNP Paribas offers flexible work arrangements, some employees may still struggle to balance their work and personal lives due to demanding workloads and long hours. Slow decision-making: As with many large corporations, BNP Paribas may have a bureaucratic decision-making process that can slow down the implementation of new initiatives and ideas. Limited mobility: Employees looking for opportunities to move up within the organization may find that promotion paths can be limited in some areas of the company. High pressure environment: Working in the financial services industry can be high pressure, and employees at BNP Paribas may feel the stress associated with meeting client expectations and delivering on complex projects.
Old systems, but that's how most banks are.
French Centric its not how hard you work, rather who you know that gets you the leg up
No cons at the moment.

minimal wfh introduction to new tech

too much red tape to get things done.
Investment bankers produce little to no revenue. Their management has no understanding of investment banking. Much more comfortable being 3rd tier on a bank facility than really leading with advice for their clients.
- Sometimes way too much focus on networking over content of work - Experience very much determined by the people on your desk and the mentors that take you under your wing - Did not seem like people under different Global Business Lines knew each other or what the others did at all with different GBLs having different vibes like one GBL more French (EQD), one GBL more of a ""boy's club"", etc.
Less pay compared to market Conservative; avoid taking a risk Less tech-savvy and less competitive
Below Average Management. No opportunities within company.
A lot of administrative processes
Processes are slow and infrastructure is bad.
needs passion and meaning of work, for folks who wants to see the meaning in their work and long term career growth instead of just a paycheck
Extended working hours Tight turnarounds and deadlines

dont think there are any
There is no cons for BNP.
I can't think of any
Overtime is expected and if you don’t do it expect to here about it in your review which effects your raise/bonus. Some departments aren’t sufficiently staffed so poor coverage for call outs and other staffing needs. You will be encouraged to “take on new tasks” in order to be promoted, but promotions may take minimum a couple years while you do extra work for free. All shifts are not treated equitably. Some members of leadership have a callus attitude toward employee discomfort about safety. I’ve been apart of the work force for 26 years, worst place I’ve ever worked. Be very careful.
Nothing i could think of honestly

Managers bully employees they don't like: repeated harsh and intimidating feedback, borderline insults, work on vacation and weekends is asked until they give up and leave. Sr Management and HR know and don't do care - they'd rather do damage control. Upward mobility is only for a few teams / star managers - don't bother staying over 2 years, most of us don't
No room for mobility; receive no bonus
Extreme bias towards the French, double bonus if you are also White and male.
-Pay -Upper Management - Employee care
No room to progress, industry does not value experience that much depending on team you are on, the company does not pay you what you are worth

There is a lot of support
None that I can think of.
They offer great hourly pay Very Responsive
Office culture is important, my office in particular was pretty great to work in, people were friendly and inclusive overall. Managers are expected to invest in their team's development; some managers are better than others about this, but at a minimum are expected to do weekly development meetings. Good amount of promotional opportunities, although these are most beneficial if you can move.
easy job for a first timer

The people at Maxim, from the very top level down, have a great outlook on supporting staff members. People are supportive and kind and a lot of fun to work with. I look forward everyday to seeing my coworkers both inside and outside of work. I started as a recruiter and moved into a management role and at every moment they drill into us that we work in a people business and the people are what makes us great.opportunities for advancement are endless as the company largely only promotes from within.
Very easy job great work like balance
It was very difficult to get supervision on cases and BCBAs and some senior therapists had friendships that turned into multiple relationships and affected other therapists.
Great starting pay upon hiring
Paid weekly, OT, benefits, PTO
Great recruiters, genuinely care for patients and workers, and nice work culture.

weekly pay flexible hours and times
Great starting pay upon hiring
Paid weekly, OT, benefits, PTO
Quick interview and paid on time
-They will hire literally anyone. If you're absolutely desperate then apply. -As a recruiter you can get promoted within 1-2 years
Gain experience, decent pay, flexible hours
You can choose your own hours and are not forced to work with any certain patients. 1:1 CARE WITH YOUR PATIENT. It is a nice change of pace From the nursing home and/or hospital where you're swamped with many patients and must tend so many needs you didn't get to actually really know your clients. With home health care, you GET TO KNOW YOUR PATIENTS & THEIR FAMILIES very well & Provide top notch nurturing nursing care! Including Assisting your patients to be able to be OUT in the community and/or go to school , which assisted in providing for their social needs also, along with all of the medical aspect!
They match you with a quick job They will assist you with licensing Your recruiter is there to answer almost any and all questions The money
The people we work with are generally friendly
This company was easy to work with for days I needed off or any other needs I had arise.
Great culture in Raleigh office, ability to go to doctors apps or wfh if needed without using PTO, PTO rarely denied, allow room for getting involved in Leadership often, have Commission and bonuses quarterly This is for the staffing side not homecare divison
Great experience do far.Happy with the training and support received
The take good care of their workers
Good supervisor, School location are great!
Great benefits, flexible, care for employees
","Absolute trainwreck of a company. My paycheck was wrong most weeks, I was overpaid and the company sought to make money off of me by having me return the gross amount rather than what came out after taxes, I was paid at a rate lower than what was agreed upon in my contract for weeks before I realized and they wouldn't pay me what they owed me for over a month. I don't know how they keep getting contracts with companies to help staff them but if there's a way to cut out the middleman and go to the company directly I'd recommend doing it as soon as the contract allows. The only way to be paid correctly and on time with this company is through legal action. On another note, I'm not even sure why they offer benefits. Their health insurance is around $1,000/month in premiums and you can get 4 hours (yes, HOURS) of PTO if you work 500 hours in a quarter and ALSO harass them over email about it because they won't actually give these measly 4 hours to you without a fight. I've never had a W-2 position in my life with such horrible benefits.
Low pay and when the school system is closed ( breaks ,holidays ,snow days ,etc) you don't get any hours that day.
Upper management sucked. The company let an employee basically drive the whole office out and had to start fresh. Pretty much everyone in the office had been reported to HR by one person and instead of looking at who was reporting everyone, they fired several and then finally after everyone left, they fired her. The new office that was built back up after everyone (but her) left, ended up having the same issues because of said employee. We were also expected to do on-call and wear many hats despite our lower salary. No WFH options. Benefits were also atrocious, which was disappointing while working in a healthcare setting.
Constant follow-up with office staff to make sure no miscommunication occurs, especially with changes in the schedule
VERY poor communication. I felt completely in the dark in regards to my job. My assignment location changed three times with less then 24 hours notice - once after I had been at a school for over a month and after I was told I was staying until the end of the school year! I was also told that they would let me know when I hit my hours to earn benefits but never did and when I finally asked about it I was told it was past the sign-up period. I was told it was a 40 hour position but when I started at the school it was actually only 32 hrs.
Flexibility of schedule was a little rough, but worth the pain for the pay. Hard to deal with the constant delays of Maxim to correct pay. You’d often have to email, call etc etc to get pay for license reimbursement, sick time, certifications and it would take weeks/months. Some recruiters better than others.
Pay was low but I was new so I accepted the offer, but later I did ask and received a raise
High turnover. Communication can be better
-requires long hours -constantly having to put out fires -your initially relying on other people to make you money -tedious processes that must be followed on a day to day basis
Pay could be a little more
You have to work hard in order to make a decent living as compared to other Maxim offices. Maxim offers a minimal cost of living adjustment which means it takes longer to earn a decent living. Also, upper leadership is mostly full of talk. Will promise you things and never deliver. Just a bunch of bros running a social club. They also preach they're pro-DEI, but most of the moves that they make say otherwise.
not enough pay compared to the market in the area benefits enrollment is not till the end of year and is expensive
Companion manager is a joke. All she does is talk about her personal life and it’s super awkward. She pretends to be some fake gangster and how she’s so “hood.” Okay whatever you say lady. Only reason she still works there is because she has dirt on one of the higher ups that would completely destroy their life.
I think from the get-go you are likely to be misled and fed a pipedream about hitting numbers that will boost your commission but as others have stated that it's just not realistic. They say it takes about 2+ years to promote and the internal politics amongst at least lower management makes them a pain to deal with. My experience with Miya, Jennifer, and Eric was not as transparent as I would have liked and I have a feeling that I am not alone in thinking this. The company had a $150 million fraud settlement a while back so reputation goes both ways when considering a career with Maxim.

-LOW base pay, commission doesn't kick in until you've really started to out perform 80% of the company. -Extreme expectations - if you manage to hit you metrics, they will be raised as the new standard. -If it costs money, they won't agree (additional sourcing tools) -THIS JOB IS A COLD CALL JOB, you work in call center, nothing more.
Pay could be a little more
They don't do holiday pay.
Training was a few days of job shadowing other newer staff, some only there for a month or two. They explained they would go over the clients with you and how to do different tasks, and they did not do that at all, no one was there my first working on my own. A lot of driving between client visits. Especially with gas as high as it, mileage pay just doesn’t make up for it It’s not a bad company necessarily, they just aren’t super upfront about the job
No room for growth without a masters
Can sometimes feel overworked & overwhelmed.
Over hire employees and like to micromanage. 90% of employees have been there less than 2 years and it is obvious why. Promotions are given based on seniority not qualifications. Culture is comparable to a high school.
It's all good; and, none of the bad.
Get overwhelming at times. Not many cons.
In-person only, which is just a personal preference
Use, Abuse, Make You Feel At Fault for anything a new client says. Even though you have bleed for them for 2 years.
4 days in office Not a lot of flexibility Not a lot of room for growth
Pay is lower than average
There is very little pto

It was very hard to gain PTO.
Commission structure is eat-what-you-kill, you make commission on the hours your candidates work. It's a fair system, but the percentage is very small - this is a new commission plan and I'm optimistic that they will increase the percentages to make this more rewarding. As a recruiter, you rely heavily on your field support team, depending on who is on your team this can be a pro or a con but I find it frustrating that there are things I *cannot* do, like initiate background checks etc esp for high priority candidates that I'd like to manage exclusively myself.

If a project ends, you might have to wait for a new assignment but Maxim does try to streamline the process.
Awful training, management is clueless
long hours and emotion stress of dealing with patients

Sometimes stressful and time consuming, but worth it.
Not much training if you are a new grad.
I don't have any cons
High employee turnover. Not enough communication between home care nurses and office staff.
The metrics needed to hire new employees makes it really hard for some offices causing bottle necking in the processes
I can be better with doing multiple tasks
Over hire employees and like to micromanage. 90% of employees have been there less than 2 years and it is obvious why. Promotions are given based on seniority not qualifications. Culture is comparable to a high school.
wait until contract is over before finding you a new contract
Have to be full time to receive benefits and the benefits are not great.
Use, Abuse, Make You Feel At Fault for anything a new client says. Even though you have bleed for them for 2 years.
4 days in office Not a lot of flexibility Not a lot of room for growth
No PTO Sick pay accrues very low
Types of homes your sent to
No cons really for this company
Slow to move up and get promoted.
Recruiters/supervisors can take a while to get back to you
No benefits! Always short staffed lots of micromanaging
Very disorganized with communication and instructions
Isolating from direct contact with coworkers
Performance based, number tied to your name
Poor work life balance if you’re commission based
Some politics in the management
Staff members change almost every year
Nothing to complain about really
The business of healthcare staffing has its ups and downs, it is difficult to deal with the roller coaster ride sometimes but that is just the nature of the industry.
Management wasn’t that great but co workers were
Supervision was lacking when the BACB requires RBTs to have 5% hours supervised.
The only negative thing I can say is the slow pace once I qualified for a raise
Office doesn’t work hard enough to find staffing for patients. They will literally wait until the day or even 15 min before to find a nurse to cover a shift when they were already aware a week or more that they didn’t have coverage. This can also be a problem when you are at work and have no one to relieve you. When covering a shift always request a meet and greet with patient, family, and a nurse that has worked with patient. You’d be surprised at the condition of people’s home and how unsafe some places are . Again, this is not the agency’s fault but could potentially cause an uncomfortable situation. They will not give you any warning of family dynamics, condition of home, etc. when they ask you to work.
can be unpredictable and unorganized at times.
Payments to employees was inconsistent, there were times I had to call and ask where my check was, only to find out my hours were not approved yet by the regional center.
They move you aroung to much
No cons really for this company
Slow to move up and get promoted.
Recruiter can be very dishonest, unorganized and unreliable. They offer the lowest rate at most facilities and often make payroll errors. Take detailed account if you’re earning weekly.
Recruiters/supervisors can take a while to get back to you
Lack of flexibility, return to office, low salary, lack of department support.
Isolating from direct contact with coworkers
Performance based, number tied to your name
Onboarding is awful and confusing, pay was frequently messed up. They act like they don’t know what they are doing with travelers
0 stability Takes forever to get a case
Poor work life balance if you’re commission based
Some politics in the management
Staff members change almost every year
Nothing to complain about really
This company needs to be shut down they will hire you all for you not to work. The lack of communication is just horrible.

No training, no support in the field, forced to go back to work the day after getting injured, no proper communication
Maxim preys on recent college grads and pays them dog sh!t money to do an extremely stressful and high-stakes job. You are encouraged by management to underpay your nurses so you make more personal commission. You are encouraged to staff patients with ""better"" insurance with higher reimbursement rates, which often leads to patients with Medicaid not receiving the services they DESERVE. It's completely unethical. There is zero work-life balance and you'll often find yourself doing work on the weekends because you feel indebted to your patients. You get yelled at all day by angry families due to lack of nursing coverage, meanwhile there is a world wide nursing shortage and no nurses want to work in home healthcare because it's barely a living wage. How is it legal to pay an RN $22/hr? It's insane. The office is called the ""pit"" and they shove desks together and you make cold calls all day like a sweatshop. You work your butt off to hit weekly $ goals so your manager gets a free trip to Cancun. All this company cares about is money (shocker), they could not care less about the patients they serve or the nurses they employ. Maxim is evil. I would rather be unemployed than work here.
Communication between worker, supervisor, and client was nonexistent. Client wasn’t even notified when worker quit.
NO BENIFITS, AT all, None, zip , Nada! Management was often Completely completely replace with all new management and my early years there.
The quick job match may be a good fit or not Little understanding of the companies they contract with Your recruiter often changes and you feel like you're starting over The benefits
Very Low base salary, unfair commission structure
None, really. Great company to work for.
Low base pay (45k recruiter and 52k RM), tough commission structure post COVID, 4 days in office, lots of changes often
No cons so far.Will update in future if I face any cons
None for now to say.
Medical benefits could be better
I really can’t say anything bad about them.

If you are looking for a west coast job that will put you on the map and give you clout that can keep up with east coast counterparts. The work culture is chill and no one works hard or is overly talented. It is the most approachable place to work considering the scale and name. It is very relaxed and has short work days if you work in ecommerce. Also doesn't take much to get the job. Also you dont have to dress up or be fashionable. Most people are basic and out of shape so you can be a slob and still get paid.

","Probably better Pay I’d say but that’s it.
The pay compared to Nike and other major brands on the east coast is 15% less on average. It is known for having layoffs and many cooperate up and downs. Also it is not super diverse but pretends to be much like portland. It is very performative and fake in their diversity initiatives for the lgbtq ai+ and poc. They also have a lack of qualified people in high up roles. most people are all over the place and do not have the pedigree to be directors, senior leads, and VPs. It is a full of mediocre people who don't know fashion. Also for a sports wear and fashion company people dress horrible. The people are so brain washed and really believe they have solved the secrets to the world. It is all around mid but great for people looking to not work hard and make money easy.
lack of effective management direction and lack of communication at times.
Very Corporate meaning that the rules are often over-exaggerated and could be too much.
Hours would get cut often when it's slow season
Rude managers and little pay
Poor to no actual benefits Limited PTO accruement Company is always changing infrastructure and systems used day to day. Way to many steps to do anything Work load can be over bearing sometimes
The options for growth are minimal, and there aren't any opportunities for corporate positions.
Lack of growth and career advancement opportunities, and low pay
Can be Stingy on hours
Sometimes the store can get too crowded
The Discount and arent strict about scheduling
Adidas does not like to promote from within. Tried to get an opportunity with the Corporate but they like to hire externally.
Over worked, under staffed, employee discounts lack.
Not very exciting and sometimes it is slow.
Low pay, lack promotion opportunities
When you’re at the office, it is pretty empty
No room for growth. Promotions are only given to people that suck up or are preferred. No annual base % salary increase and small bonuses. Not worth it
The pay is very low
sometimes understaffed and tasks would pile on one person
Lots of work to do and has a lot of competition
Not very exciting and sometimes it is slow.
Salary is low and non-negotiable. You really have to leave the company (and go to Nike) to then come back and get a competitive salary.

The structure and the culture of the company are very disconnected globally. All the resources are spent in Germany, where people have incredible job security; they play position musical chairs, but the Germans will always have a chair, and the rest of the world fights for the one that gets taken away. Ironically the rest of the world generates most of its revenue. The impact is that very little work gets done, but there is a lot of politics. Every time you create a good result but don't follow a tried and true process, you create problems for yourself. No consistency in the acceptable behavior of employees; the higher the employee band, the more you can do whatever you want. Toxic management is always looking for a scapegoat, usually not themselves—no culture of accountability in the leadership and lack of any backbone. You can do amazing things for the company, but in the end, it doesn't matter. There is even less loyalty than I could imagine from a big corporation. The employee with the most longevity is those that do just enough to get by. Tracy McGrady said it the best ""I deserve better.""
I can not think of any
Less competitive pay, heavy work load
The company structure is disorganized and disconnected. Most resources are spent at HQ in Germany or for the EU market, even though other markets are responsibly for all positive growth and sale. All other markets have to fight for resources and support. Outdated technology continually slows down progress. Clear lack of company vision and brand voice. Constant hiring freezes leave roles not backfilled, teams unable to get meaningful work done and feel constantly overworked. Leadership is constantly change priorities and focus and refuse to take accountability for their clear lack of vision and leadership.
No air conditioning, back breaking work. No one stays there cause it sucks. Terrible
No cons of working at adidas
No work life balance, all teams work differently which leads to a lot of conflict when you work cross-functionally. No annual raises unless ""the company is doing well"". HR is entriely unhelpful in your growth.
You might have to play the game of Retail to move ahead
The training was the worst I’ve received in a warehouse. I was sexually harassed by my trainer the whole day. I reported it but nothing was done. Everyone I spoke to there had no good things to say.
It is definitely a fast-paced working environment, so if you're not up for such challenge then I wouldn't recommend it.
There are very little growth opportunities, bonus decisions are entirely based on company (not personal or team) performance, which means they don't happen. Salary is low, and cost of living increases are not significant enough to actually support the true rise in cost of living. Senior leadership team is all talk, and no action. The brand is very dependent on their long-established brand name.
The too-long-stay People are old-fashioned and like to judge others, especially newcomers. Newcomers sometimes have to guess what they mean and flatter them. There are “white lies” and some other issues like indirect feedback, often saying something then changing it at the last minute,... I come from a culture where if you were told to do something, you did it with purpose and in the most effective way. But, working here, that has been a big challenge and transition because I am called to be flexible in every aspect.
Not enough hours given out
It is a very hectic job The military verification is done through ID.Me which usually causes issues with veteran customers. For any sort of days off whether paid or not you are required to ask 3 weeks in advance, very unlikely for you to get a day off otherwise Trading Shifts is not easy and oftentimes it is not allowed unless the circumstance requires it. Upwards Mobility is nonexistent, and the likelihood of one being promoted or even getting a raise is slim to none. No tardiness allowed, meaning even a minute late is reflected.
Very corporate, difficult to climb the ladder
- Opportunities for growth don’t come often
no growth or development leadership hides in their offices HR is never around Lack of raise/bonus
I have no cons - enjoyed the job.
Slow on decisions & promotions
The management is a set of people who pick and choose who is ""in"" and who is not. They cherry pick the ones who are accountable for breaking the rules and who is allowed to skate by doing as they please, all the while creating a paper trail so when they turn on someone the documentation for wrong doings and rules broken back them up and give them justification for termination. The management is nothing but a boys club with exclusive membership or a very shady set of people who thrive on setting examples out of others shortcomings.
There is no downsides in this company
time given for lunch was short
Not many hours unless its the wekeend. Small store at the time due to expansion construction, things got cramped on the weekends.
Not enough hours terrible pay
Not enough chances to grow
Values, Partnerships, Career Development, Location
Customers and high volume store
You do not know who you work with unless you ask around.
-overworked - Management was not motivating enough. The whole floor team changed several times in the 5 months I worked there
Management don't typically care about disabilities & it's a constant game of telephone with each manager & no truth comes out & no problem gets resolved
Retail, long hours, district manager
no cons at this moment
Listening to how the employees feel about anything involving personal self expression
Low pay even though it is a multi billion dollar company with partnerships with luxury brands...those brands usually pay starting at $20. adidas starts at $16
low pay. long hours, typical non challenging/stimulating warehouse work.
Time consuming Pay Management can be unprofessional
Micromanaging, they give you as little shifts as possible and the shifts aren't even 8 hours long
Better representation in the marketplace!
i love the work and everything is great
Heavy politics and declining culture
associates are cool to work with pay is decent
Promotes from within, but looks over more experienced employees.
They expect you to work above your pay grade, management is a mess and unorganized, new management every few months and stressful environment. They only hire from outside the company to fill in roles that new management can never stick to.
- Working at an outlet store, the majority of the time, the store would already be 50 or 40 percent off, meaning that your discount is useless certain weeks and did not stack. - Retail hours, very early mornings and very late evenings, be prepared to bend backward and not see sunlight. - Unrealistic company goals to reach - Unmotivated and toxic upper management - Too many managers on duty leads to conflicts of opinion
Schedule sucks/no weekends off mostly Hard to level up
Scheduling flexibility can be a pain, especially during holidays and such.
pay rate is terrible with no raises
big corporate disconnect with retail stores
limited career development in certain countries
Lots of standing if you don’t like it
Cons: demanding, stressful, corporate, unpredictable
No internal promotions Hours Capped for Part Time
Not to many downsides just not alot hours
Poor management at upper levels of Adidas.
Adidas does not have an annual pay increase based on job performance. I have seen an increase of $5k over the course of my three years as a 'cost of living adjustment working for the company. Growth is difficult to come by financially and in personal career trajectory.
Management was a headache and lack communication sometimes.
not highly paied, no growing in carier
Limited hours and overstaffed sometimes
There are no opportunities to move up. Leadership will string you along with false hope of growth.
Salary was not really competitive for the position

Great chance to learn enterprise level software and modern technologies as well. Very good compensation, flexible and friendly working environment.
Getting better than it was before the acquisition of CA technologies
Broadom Corporation fostered an environment that not only encouraged personal and professional growth but also valued its employees as vital contributors to the organization’s success. From day one, I felt welcomed and supported by my colleagues and superiors, creating a sense of belonging and camaraderie that made each workday enjoyable.
Hock is a strong leader and knows how to grow the company. You work with some of the best and brightest engineers. The bonuses and RSU's are highly competitive. Hard work and consistency are rewarded.
Long shifts, but 4 days off really help recovering
Hock Tan is a visionary leader. Good pay and benefits. RSUs are nice.
As a Broadcom Application Engineer, your primary responsibility would be to work closely with customers to understand their technical requirements and provide them with the necessary support to successfully integrate Broadcom's products into their systems. Your duties may include designing and implementing solutions using Broadcom's products, debugging and troubleshooting technical issues, providing technical training to customers, and collaborating with other members of the engineering team to improve product functionality. To excel in this role, you should have a strong technical background in areas such as Networking, and embedded systems. You should also have excellent communication skills and be able to work effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. In addition, you should be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and be able to manage multiple projects simultaneously while meeting tight deadlines.

Healthy work environment and excellent upper management and flat hierarchy
good company , work life balance well
To be honest, when I first interviewed for this position, I was not sure how long I would be able to stay. I had worked for a large company similar to Broadcom years ago and I felt like a number. This is absolutely not the case at Broadcom. The hiring package, benefits, flexibility is unbeatable. I have nothing negative to say at all! I am not sure why others are not jumping to join this great company. I literally love my job and my manager. My team is amazing and I have a great work / life balance.

If you toe the line you will be rewarded handsomely. No unnecessary benefits (free lunch? What's that?), but it all lands in your paycheck instead. Eliminating redundancy gives each staff member more autonomy.
Good work life balance. Could learn new things.
Light work, good hourly rate and benefits.
Pay and benefits were pretty standard for a large american company. The break system was pretty nice. We got 2 hours of paid breaks per day. I really liked working 12 hour days.

Good structure, friendly people, well organized company that is strong financially and a global leader in semiconductor and cloud computing. Great hours (24/7 manufacturing using 12 hour shifts) but essentially you get HALF of the month off to do what you want -without- burning leave.
Good company, good compensation, good colleges, nice enviroment.
","Long hours, lots of walking but gets you in shape
Lacking in empathy towards needs or situations of employees.
tough culture, demanding hours, up or out
It may be a little tough for an entry level employee with few working experiences.
Could be better. Hopefully the CEO handles thing with more grace than he has in the past with acquisitions
Furthermore, Broadom Corporation prioritized work-life balance. The company understood the importance of maintaining a healthy and fulfilling personal life, ensuring employees had the flexibility and support to achieve it. This balance led to increased productivity and a strong sense of overall well-being, which undoubtedly contributed to the company’s continued success.
If your division fails to perform, expect *changes*. The company builds and acquires technologies that have an existing foothold in the market. As such, do not expect the dynamic, cutting edge, risk tolerant, innovation that you might see in a startup or early stage tech company.
Intense work- can be mentally strenuous
They are constantly redefining roles. They are minimalists (i.e. can't use MS Office products, only Google (Docs, Sheets, etc.)). No raises in 3 years.
No Work from Home option and no perks for the employees
Everything else. The culture is toxic. The people are toxic. The job is toxic. You are regularly forced to commit ethical violations or face the consequences (get laid off for non-performance). People have countdowns to the end of the quarter written on their whiteboards because that's how many days they need to survive without getting laid off to get a couple more RSUs vested. I have personally been on calls where people (upper management) scream and abuse others while everyone sits in silence. Bullying is encouraged. Don't work here. Why would you want to work here? For the money? I promise you, it isn't worth it. Run for the hills.
Only focused on ELA deal structures with large customers.
Lack of Career Progression and ability to influence Comp
Uses a we can do more with less people culture
Very dated remote working policies and very few perks, other than compensation which was mostly from their stock grants. Managers are paid an absolutely ridiculously high salary with regard to their actual performance and qualifications. Some on-call and frequent weekend work was required for my position.
Long hours and ruthless focus on profitability
Laid off with no warning
work life balance is hard
- Broadcom's method of going after the big fish only is backfiring; losing a lot of business - Customers are leaving but no new business is coming in
The work is a lot for a CM.
Nothing in specific, just need to adapt
Uses a we can do more with less people culture
Currently, under this economy, there is limited career growth

No opportunity for advancement, company already too-heavy
Promotions, cost of living raises

I don't think of any.
Employees are treated poorly, and county COVID regulations were flagrantly ignored due to distrust of employees.
* Management could care less that they are working people to exhaustion * No celebrations, even after huge accomplishments/releases * Little or no positive feedback from scrum team / product mgt leadership * Financial carrot of annual bonus is good, but not guaranteed. Pray that the company and your business area do well. Bonus + the low pay = what I can get elsewhere without the other cons.
Toxic work environment. It’s like working with high school clicks
You should be a self learner
Cons differ from person to person.
1. Get stuck after certain level in career 2. Work pressure
So much negativity. Favoritism and high school clique type things go on. Supervisors are rude and lack in interpersonal communication skills and social awareness.
burnout environment. very hard to get promoted.
Expect zero innovation and boring technology . If you are a level 5+ engineer, you will be rich with all the RSUs. If you are mid-career then look elsewhere. The only purpose of everything is to increase the stock price.
None that I can think of right now.
some times vacation is too less
I really do not have anything negative to say at all. I am very happy with my job at Broadcom. The only other job that valued me as much as Broadcom has was my first real job out of college. Shortly thereafter, employers leaned into ""everyone's replaceable"", but today, that isn't the case. We need and want good people. I encourage you to apply and take the first step to potentially changing your life. I could have never been able to purchase my own home, be debt free, have a solid retirement plan and great benefits.
acquisition objectives at odds with staffing needs
- RSUs become golden handcuffs at Broadcom - No Corporate culture, the only focus is on the bottom line and often customers and employees suffer as a result - No raises during 2 years, blame COVID, the however company was highly profitable - The amount of RSUs granted in the second year was less than 10% of the initial grant - They took away Salesforce, Gainsight, and Slack after the acquisition and our a Google shop (Gmail, Google Docs)
- Certain departments (like Industrial Engineering, Change Management, Project Management) have a free pass to be rude and treat the operations team with disrespect. Management is aware of the issue and doesn't seem to care. - Company doesn't value nurturing their employees. If you want to learn, you have to do it yourself. Don't expect any help from anyone in the company and expect people to be annoyed when you try and learn new skills. - Overall, culture in the Fort Collins branch is a wash. Everyone is trying to push each other down instead of helping each-other succeed.
No cons at this time
Poor work life balance; no peak and trough cycles.
Come to office. Poor management.
No work from home No proper documentation culture, only depends on knowledge transfer
base salary is too low compared to other soc companies. promotions are slow, with minimal salary gain. no reviews by peers or yourself, everything is based on your manager like you or not. ok work-life balance, but been asked by the manager to stay in the office for 8 hours before my promotion. most of the people here are 40+/50+ and have been here for 10+ yers. if you are in the early stage of your career, hard to fit in.
No Work from Home whatsoever. Culture is too cut throat now.
Challenging to have a work life balance
- None as far as I have experienced. Can be team dependent.
Not any to speak of
Management team not the best
flat organization, limited upward mobility in some roles/areas
Too bad it got bought by Broadcom.
Tied to one big customer
Minimal HR Poor personnel managmenet
work life balance is minimum

Always the underdog. Tech field is not just about the product, it is also who the incumbent big dog is. This is where they were disadvantaged.
Lot a lot to learn
base salary is too low compared to other soc companies. promotions are slow, with minimal salary gain. no reviews by peers or yourself, everything is based on your manager like you or not. ok work-life balance, but been asked by the manager to stay in the office for 8 hours before my promotion. most of the people here are 40+/50+ and have been here for 10+ yers. if you are in the early stage of your career, hard to fit in.
No Work from Home whatsoever. Culture is too cut throat now.
Harsh and authoritarian leadership. Eliminating wasteful and redundant costs usually incurs painful reductions too. Doesn't actively hire very much... the divisions are just working on their current product paths and no encouragement for diversifying through innovation
The promotion rate is low.
Fair career outlook and pointless on-site working policies.
This company can't fire a bad employee, that made life miserable for the rest of us. If someone was bad enough to get put on a corrective action, and that is a pretty high bar to begin with, it'll take a couple years to get them out the door.
Management team not the best
Some mangers have favorites Lots of gossip Drama 18 months till you can switch shifts
Larger competitors, tough competiton. Difficult space for the company to succeed.
No stability in following a business process goal. Always layoffs happening citing lane reasons
Fair career outlook and pointless on-site working policies.
So mangers have favorites. Days can be stressful or boring. Seems never in the middle.
Not so good networking team.

Too much company politics. Favoritism. Nepotism. HR approaches issues as if the worker is the enemy. Don't trust company to take care of you in case of injury. Document issues and protect yourself from company outright throwing you under the bus. If you get hurt, have ambulance come get you. Or they will do everything through insurance to claim it was unrelated.
I have not found any negative
Culture clash. The manager that ran the show belittled the whole team from India to the US. Everyone was scared of losing their jobs so nobody reported it to HR.
Had to work to get paid.
Work from home ain't happening.
Lack of growth, tasks become mundane
Politics and boring , no career growth
culture is not the same everywhere
office 100% for lower level engineers, no food, no way to voice concerns, unmotivated employees, no innovation, low pay compared to other tech companies
Not significant if placed in right group
Boring Slow Boring Slow Woah
Always looking over your shoulder for next round of layoffs.
Facility in Fort Collins doesn't pay enough to compensate for the high cost real estate and living in Northern Colorado. Average pay for -experienced- technicians starts around $30/hr. Company is having a hard time filling positions because other semiconductor companies in Utah, Arizona, and elsewhere pay at least $10 more/hr. This division/location was the bread winner for the company for over 10 years but lately the market has become more saturated and challengers are making great strides to take away market share. Fort Collins facility has been on the market to sell but no takers stepped forward. I don't see wages increasing within reason since housing in this area averages $400K for 3 br/2ba house. The gap between California price for housing is closing. Many Californians and dot-com boom business people have flooded here and will pay way over ($50k+) just to buy a house, so most locals are priced out of the market.
Some competition and hardly any cons that one can think off.

Protected PTO- granted 40 hours of this. Serves as pto that automatically kicks in should you ever call out, are late, or have to leave early. The difference between this and regular PTO is you don’t need to submit a request for it. Nothing else.

no pros to provide for this company
My hours was great, had my own office, pay was mediocre
Paid holidays. Many nice, friendly people work there. Work is fairly light, aside from the many hours spent driving it's tiring but not strenuous work. It's in the healthcare industry so it's a stable long term job, If you can deal with being hen pecked and micro managed by Management and other Cons of the job, you could stay there forever.
They have good Benefits. Pay starts out at 19 a hour. I liked Remote Working. Independence and not having a manager on my back long as the work was done.
Benefits are standard, nothing special
- Good & Steady pay - Large Company - Experienced Sales Teams - Support Career Progression - Work/life Balance
Excellent work culture and great place to learn and grown within the org
Amazing benefits from healthcare to pto/ day-off and discounts.
superb firm, great life, no regrets
Salary - at least on the surface, until you realize that you are expected to carry the workload of 3-4 peoples worth. There are many people there who want to do the right thing, but just don't have the bandwidth. Production floor people were hard working and very knowledgeable.
None at all horrible place to work
Good work life balance with decent pay
Boss was easy to work for
Health, pay(wages) education, cleanliness great co workers
If you're looking for a company that will take a chance on you w/o prior HR background, CAH is the way to go. The team based in OH were really nice and collaborative. So can't complain. Basically getting promotion is like playing a role on Game of Thrones. The more connection you know, the more chances of landing promotion. Less network means less career advancement
Several of the management are very open to differing points of view.
The pay is fair compared to other jobs around and there is some overtime to pamper the income.
Benefits, Good Pay, Diversity and Inclusion
Remote position, low pay but good working hours for a grad student. Management was flexible and understanding
The hours were what i needed
","There really isn’t many other than the occasional difficult people I encounter at work.
1. Data systems are difficult to work with 2. Salary is below expectation
Expectations of the position set up by a company recruiters is nothing like what the actual position is, consists of. People with little to no experience in Quality are hired, given the same name and rank as “senior quality tech”, and get paid the same. No annual raise. Final quality-based decisions are made by production supervisors; makes quality personnel question their position. Hierarchy is upside down. Majority of production workers are paid more than quality techs and tend to get their way every time. Most are greater in age and make lots of demands that caused the worksite to split their first shift by an hour.. Quality techs are basically babysitters that come around and confirm paperwork, MUST work every Saturday (rotating techs) if even just 2 production workers volunteer to work OT. No flexibility in timing. Quality techs are tied at the hip with production workers, with production leading. Anyone who’s worked even just a year in any QA/QC field can tell this position does not live up to the title “Senior Quality Technician”. Just a nice title to add to your resume especially if you’re new to the Quality field.
Alot of nepotism/ favoritism. Hours can be long in a hot warehouse.
Total comp is about 5-10% less (estimate) than competitors in space. Bonus payout not 100% multiple years. Merit not that great considering the economic challenges (been a thing since I started). Not all positions created the same. Med side (you can google this side of Cardinal Health for context) or COE (consolidation) roles can be very challenging. Getting to director level + positions can be very difficult (even with lots of experience internal to Cardinal). Can get VERY siloed.
Difficult to move the needle in large company. Job pay is low compared to others in market. Inflation and cost of living not considered in salary negotiations. Management is always steered by VP prerogatives and unable to think for themselves.
Start and finish time changed weekly with little or no plan ahead, no time for family. Could never tell anyone I would be somewhere at a specific time because the work schedule was constantly changing. Worked every holiday with added hours on top.
No moving up Favoritism amongst management Work you like a dog Micromanagement Practically no moving up Long hours Rampant sexual harassment which doesn't get taken seriously
Low margin business. Lack of investment in technology.
Mediocre benefits, wfh do you have to provide your own equipment, low pay. Productivity is the most important factor.
There were not many clear ways of progressing your career, which became difficult. I was happy to take on additional responsibilities; it would have been motivating to receive a promotion or raise in return.
Bureaucratic Political Gamesmanship is off the charts
Since the job is remote it’s slow process when speaking with managers or higher management
Pay, Managment and culture. Managers need more training with people Managment.
While this role is portrayed as a ""Sales"" position, it is not. Majority of time is spent handling customer, delivery, internal company issues. Just beware what is in the job description and the role manager portrays is not the reality of day to day responsibilities and activity. Also, be prepared to be accessible 24/7 even on Cardinal Health appointed Holidays and during PTO. Minimal work/life balance.
Need to work like machine and high pace work environment. Need strong legs.
Depending on which area you work in. As for me, Management needs to improve on communication skills and engage more with new hires.
Senior leadership was not transparent. I was hired in the middle of the year, and was laid off at the end of the year due to a corporate restructure with no indication this was happening. I ended up applying for multiple positions at Cardinal Health after being laid off and seemed like I was essentially blacklisted from the company. During my time at the firm, there was a severe lack of documentation for processes which it made it much more difficult to find solutions to my questions since the position was remote.
Very poor management, lack of communication between employees and managers, not much opportunity to grow unless you are a friends or family member of management or one of the leads, the refrigerator room is way too cold and causes soreness if you don’t have on a full body heat suit, and you are set to very very high expectations when it comes to packing the medicine.
-Bad management no one knows what's going on and they never let you know ahead of time the strikes you have. - if you take sick days you will get strikes. -Had to miss two days due to the weather which was out of my control and they still said it was counted against me. -Had a dentist appointment and asked for the day and they said it was ok, next thing you know they let me go. Found it unfair why I got let go since I let them know and if they knew that I would get let go for taking that day off they should've let me know. -Raises here are the worst no matter how long you work here they give you like a 10 cent or 11 cent raise. -Never give you an exact time when you can leave expect you to give your life for this company. They expect you to drop everything for them knowingly that they will fire you if you call out sick or cant make it to work. -They ask for so much but give you so little. -Never let you know what's going on had a time where they come and ask for one thing and switch it an hour before we leave. -Never have the proper equipment or gloves when I asked never cared to reach out and give me them. -Gave me a size small glove (I wear a xl) and told me to make it work. -Ask you to drive lifts or have higher position for the same pay,

Very high turnover rate with upper management.
Pay is lower than average salaries
Seems to be a lack of motivation to retain employees with institutional knowledge
Politic environment at the pants
Senior management is fresh and implementing lots of change that is needed and will benefit in the long run. Mid managers are struggling to implement. Internal groups are in conflict right now fighting over budgets. Cross functional collaboration feels low right now. Hiring is stagnant, it is difficult to get approval to open a job requisition. I would like to stay but I will leave if I can't find a good role or stretch assignment. I expect to leave before 1 year. DE&I is improving but diversity is more than women in leadership positions. I know they know that but I am not seeing it.
Limited flexibility for employees Low resources and challenges with prioritization More relationship based than collaboration
CSS: Long hours, generally the brunt of unhappy customers, high stress environment for sales to perform, fall-out from supply chain misses, can have long hours with little work life balance Manufacturing and Inventory: None of these: inclusivity, empathy, people development, career development assistance, process and efficiency driven, plus micromanagement, no structure, no training, no clear direction, no contextual support on any processes, TOXIC ENVIRONMENT where managers discuss co-workers in front of their peers and when you ask a question there are audible sighs from the SME. No work life balance - meetings scheduled outside of core hours / outside of business hours for west coast based personnel,

Working in the edgepark medical supplies sect of cardinal is mentally taxing. Most of the training is rushed. The company moves your training class to different depts.

You're expected to take the customers abuse. They count off for every little thing missed on a call. The company turn over is awful and yet they do nothing to make things better for the agents that come to work. I would have giving no stars if that was an option.

Manufacturing environment that has not been organized or streamlined to maximize quality, delivery, employee satisfaction or best manufacturing processes. No idea what continuous improvement means. Leadership is weak and isolated. I am a seasoned professional with 30 years experience and a degree in Economics. I hired as entry-level to learn the business processes and workforce culture. Leadership understood I was interested in moving into a progressively responsible role but after a time I realized I was wasting my energy and talent. It’s too bad when Leadership sees you as a threat instead of an asset. This might be unique to this location (339 Mason Drive La Vergne TN) but I’ve seen this in other industries as well.

Restructuring Frequently Strategy tends to be short term vs long term

Teams often work in silos, so knowledge transfer different segments of the business is minimal. Has been a lot of upper leadership turnover in the last 2 years, so that has been challenging to adjust to.

Poor Management, unappreciated, underpaid, did not hold workers accountabiable, very, very poor communication skills
Low starting pay. A little more than minimum wage and if you're lucky you might get a .35 cents yearly raise. Driver Bonuses are usually either a free bacon egg and cheese, or coffee n donuts, or sandwich wrap every 6 months. The driver management at the Bronx location was passive aggressive, low key disrespectful and antagonizing. Watches and judges everything you do including what you have for lunch and what you do on your personal time. Job description says it's rotating hours and shifts but actually the new drivers just get Stuck with the worst hours and shifts nobody else wants including the overnight shifts on Friday and Saturday night.. Not knowing what time you're getting off during the week. If you work first shift, and you're new, you will definitely always get stuck with the late calls so don't plan on being home for dinner. And that sometimes happens on the worst days like the day before holiday weekends when roads are packed with everyone leaving work early except you. Now you're stuck in traffic for another 4 hours after 8 hours of driving. In the year I worked there I saw 3 drivers get hired and quit within 3 months and another 3 have quit since I left.
They crammed in a bunch of information for 1 month of training. After training you do nothing that you were taught in training. They put you on the floor alone even though you have no clue what you’re doing, while handling serious medical information. I’ve asked for help numerous times & often don’t get replies. Supervisor & Management is trash. They don’t care about you succeeding or messing up patients files. You have to be in a horrible position for a year to move up. Everyone I trained with quit. Save yourself the stress & don’t even apply.
No career growth, corporate red tape, poor leadership
- Too Reactive vs Proactive in Marketplace - Disorganization & Siloed Departments - Limited Comp Opportunities
None that I can think of.
Extreme favoritism from both upper management and internal management. Not very diverse when it comes to company events/ meals. Aka Chick-fil-a for every meal.
very bad firm, bad life, lots of regrets
Speaking strictly for the Chicopee site only. Senior management has comprehension issues. Feedback is ignored. You will be expected to carry the workload of several people's worth and when mistakes happen you will be the scapegoat. Training is non-existent. MRP system is antiquated 1970's-80's ERA... (BPCS). No investment in the building and or efforts to properly staff across the board. Place is a ghost town. Site director created hostile work environment. If anything was missed it was finger pointing and then eventually progressed to yelling and aggressive body language, rather than how do we solve this. Repeated requests for help (proper staffing and training) were ignored. Others in senior management do not know how to stay in their own lanes and worry about their depts. Will send you on wild goose chases based on what they think they know. No update will suffice. The land of ""what about this though?"" ""Maybe we should revisit this?"" MICRO MANAGED TO DEATH. No training but quick to criticize if something is not done or done the way they think it should be done... You will be in meetings 5-10 hours or more a week. 36% attrition rates... Whole purchasing dept (3 people) quit in 2022 alone within 3 months time prior to my arrival. I was the fourth to quit in 2022.
Horrible work life balance and pay is horrible
Shifts where always changing start time, no room for growth
Hierarchy is hard to influence
No enough work life balance
Too much restructuring and cost cutting going on. Lots of great talents leaving. Way behind globalization. Salary distortion is prevalent among the HR team. TA and the HR team needs to work hand in hand to ensure that hiring for a Sr HR/managerial role is done flawlessly. Hiring candidate w/ solid Hr background in the managerial and director level is something that everyone needs to maintain as minimum requirement. If the hiring process keeps doing it wrong, expect a high turnover from great unhappy ees leaving the team.
Pay is not competitive with industry coming into area and higher management is not willing to take subject matter experts ideas seriously.
It is a business and sometimes you sacrifice time with family to fulfill the order needs.
Nothing much to call out
Low pay compared to competitors
No equipment training even though they said they would. Toxic work environment where the employees were forced to work with this person No room for growth You cant move departments if you feel unsafe

your pros are based predominantly on your manager. if they see value in you, you get trained in more stuff and MAYBE it leads to something more than a comfortable work space. and depending on what program you work you might like what you do.
Its stable employment with a 6% 401K match, which is rare from the jobs I've had. There are endless opportunities to learn and grow if you out the effort in.
I was at the Simi Valley site - good vacation policy (4 weeks given to you no matter when you are hired) - middle managers are very understandable and helpful - lots of things todo and learn - Great people with full of veteran engineers and personnel
The people and teams I've worked with have been great so far, and everyone is always focused on doing her best for the business. Sick days are very flexible and unlimited, with pay, so that is convenient.

They have very few layoffs and there's a lot of different programs at this location, so there's usually always work to be done. Sometimes the work assign is not appealing, but it will keep you busy and get you paid. They also pay for overtime, even salaried employees, and this can really increase your annual pay. Great way to make extra money. Flexible schedule, no one really questions vacation or leaving early because the state is already very family/religious oriented, they respect people's decisions to do things outside of work that take up good amount of your time.
-Fairly generous with PTO -Lots of skill development very quickly depending on how long you can drink from the firehose of information -Complex issues were engaging to solve with multiple team members with different IT and professional backgrounds providing different angles to attack a problem with

Flexibilities - 9/80 schedule, Unlimited vacation (need VP approval after 5 weeks). Sick time. Job stability. Good processes in place. Very nice people. Opportunities to grow by applying to different jobs within the company.
Varied, challenging work Flexible schedule (mostly) Hands-off
Lots of historic legacy. And, in their own onboarding speech... ""they already have achieved excellence"". What more can you want?
Technology and mission Most customers. Challenges and successes. Many operating domains. People and talent.
Great group of people to work with
Very protective of employees during hard years. Competitive pay, great PTO/family/sick policy, 9/80 schedule with flexibility for remote people. Interesting opportunities with or without clearance. Annual raises and consideration for advancement. Good work/life and not much scrutiny on your work ethic, if you want a job where you can just chill then look no further.
""Unlimited"" vacation is a huge plus if you use it.
Extremely interesting products, and generally good lower-level employees.
Very inclusive environment. If you’re looking for a company that allows you to move around they are great.

Large learning curve as we merged multiple aging network AD environments into one new, clean AD environment. Enjoyed learning new security protocols and tools to repair security issues. Problem solving always interesting and productive personnel is the goal of any Enterprise Security team.

My team had very relaxed scheduling. Be there at 10:15AM standup, complete your work, and hit your required hours per week. The facility is open 24/7 so you could come in early and clock out early, or come in late and clock out late, or some combination of both. The general expectation was to work 9 hours per day (30 minute lunch and breaks included), with every other Friday off. At my location there was a housing stipend.
People are well treated. Women seem to be treated equally to men which is good to see. Working remote and hybrid is a wonderful convenience. Overtime pay is available. Work Life balance is quite good. Inclusion and diversity is strongly supported by everyone.
There are none unless you like getting reamed.

They offer a 9/80 work schedule. They will give you an opportunity to sink or swim. Depending on your personality and skillset, that may or may not be a bad thing.

interview process was simple enough
This is my first job as an engineer after graduating college. The job is not very difficult and they are very patient with new hires. I can ask questions and people are happy to share their knowledge with me. There are also very good benefits.

I love my immediate group.
Great support Challenging Smart people
Co-workers are some of the most amazing people.
Mostly low pressure work environment. Great people to work with. My Managers are rather calming rather than high strung like other places I have been. Paid OT for salaried employees so I do not feel like a billable hour slave. The company will normally get you the tools and software you need to do your job... None of the ""can you use free or open source"" response when asking for software. Company is big on diversity and inclusion! You will meet people from all over the world and different ethnicities and backgrounds. Everyone thus far has been excellent character. EVERYONE I have encountered here has been very welcoming and friendly. Some people come off as high strung but once you get to know them its different. Company is very accommodating for those with special needs.. just don't be afraid to ask! Company has an internal job openings website so you can see what positions are open and apply for them. Company has so much technological resources available as one of my coworkers said once ""I need to inspect this item let me go over and use the electron microscope... Oh wait its being used.... oh ok Ill go use the other one...."" We have a PCB Fabrication Lab on campus where we can have custom prototype boards build. We have multiple assembly lines for circuit cards. Company is big on values and quality of work.
L3Harris is a USG contractor who serves various DoD customers with a noble cause of keeping America safe.
Unlimited PTO, ability to work from home for emergency situations, holiday time, and working with government contracts
Work can be interesting, depending on what program you are in. 160 hours of PTO, not including sick time
Pay and benefits are great
Employees are given a lot of flexibility with their work schedules. Most of the technology L3Harris develops is complex/interesting. Employees have lots of opportunity for internal job movement and are typically given a say in which projects and teams they work on.
It is a clean and safe job. Corporate tries to promote inclusiveness as much as possible. There are a lot of opportunities to move around as there are many locations in other states.
Insurance benefits, work remotely, good life work balance
Family mentality and atmosphere between everyone.
offered reasonable pay and benefits
Every other Friday off or 80hrs/9 days. Unlimited PTO. GREAT WLB
Mediocre pay, good work environment, good work-life balance.
The people are awesome to work with and I genuinely enjoy coming into work. The work is interesting, although can be slow from time to time. Lots of opportunities to try new things, move around, and build your resume.
The facility I work at is very large...one of the largest in North Texas...with nearly 6,000 employees spread out across more than 1,200 acres and 5 million square feet of buildings under roof. Because of that, there are ample opportunities to work with people from all walks of life and with varying degrees of knowledge/experience in a wide range of fields. Compared to other departments (i.e. engineering), my department is small and thus more ""close knit"", so working as a team is much easier. However, both my inter-departmental colleagues as well as those I've worked with from other areas have all been a pleasure to work with. Nearly every person I've encountered is intelligent, knowledgeable, and experienced, and their passion for their field of expertise is evident. From a company leadership standpoint, their commitment to a strong and well run workplace is also evident.
Value diversity, Good benefits, Good work, Good people
- 9/80 schedule allows for every other weekend to be 3 days. - High starting pay - Flexibility in work schedule - Unlimited vacation (to a point)
","Some of the older employees were a bit cranky but thats not L3 Harris’s fault. Other than that I have no complaints
There is always a probability your raise will be laughable. 3% is the max for the year. Company values new people more than veterans so your raise will never reach what new people get walking in with less experience. if your lead doesn't like you or see your value they won't let you grow. most managers will laugh at any ideas for improvment (not all) even if everyone else agrees. no bonuses most managers don't want to see you develop. when they are busy you will work as long as they can but when they are slow they barely offer training or cross training. traing courses expect you already have done the task they just certify you for it here. vs actual training course. in some spaces very toxic workspace emotionally (specifically when work load is weak)
If you're not a technology junky, it can become very uninspiring work that begins to wear you out after a few years. You'll be around alot of people who are either ambitious, or obsessive about their craft because they love understanding technology. For others who see L3Harris as a job and not a career, that can create a deflating environment to be in. Pay sucks, everyone knows it. There are floods of people leaving the company all the time for better pay at other jobs. Then they hire newer, younger, less qualified people for more money than the people who've been there a while. Then the old guard crowd gets pissed and either demands raise or leaves. That cycle has played out numerous times. The silver lining is they eventually cave and give pay increases when this happens to make sure the machine keeps running.
- Horrible benefit, sometimes I wonder if they really care about employees - daily motivational email that does not really help anyone but ego boost for senior management - Senior Management expects to be an obedient dog does not expect fight back - Senior management uses Humiliation as a tactic to control employees (I saw my manager yelled at by the director for some really minute reason) -instead of hiring more people management like to whip current workforce. - NO BONUS they use the referral honor system and expect to gather points through peers' recommendations.
Being promoted even within your own line of work is very difficult, and the pay raises aren't enough to keep up with the current cost of living very easily. Unlimited vacation tends to be truncated to 4 weeks, and doesn't accrue, so use it or lose it.
Considered an essentail worker, but not compensated as one. Management can be very wishy-washy. There's a lot of empty promises from upper management that never actually happened. Have to stay at your position for a year before you can transfer to a different position.
There's a lot of favoritism shown to people who are in the manager's friendship/religious circle. If you're one of the ""chosen ones"" you will get a lot of good work and promotions. If you're not, good luck. You will have to really fight for yourself to be seen and heard and get good program assignments. Ultimately, it's about who you know and playing the game, doesn't matter how good you are or how hard you work, you will not advance quickly if you're not a chosen one. There's also been a few people ""black balled"" who just are unable to advance because they ticked someone in leadership off. Very troubling culture. There's a lot of terrible managers and no training provided, so they don't really get better. Leadership development is not a priority. Overtime was often forced to increase billings. You get paid for it but it's forced on you which can errode your work/life balance. Not a lot of diversity, but this is due to the fact the company is located in Utah.
-Pay could be much better for the amount of highly specialized work you are expected to be proficient at -Micromanagement and interpersonal issues between coworkers and departments -Out of touch upper management -Most everyone there was burnt-out or checked out, not many friendly faces -Benefits outside of PTO were average or below average -Stale corporate environment and culture -On-call/late shifts were the norm, and the primary performance benchmark for rewards were how many shifts you picked up, not how well you did at the job -Unless you really need the experience or have a high tolerance for burnout, I can't recommend this job or company as you will get used up. Turnover for our department was higher than most restaurants.
Poor alignment, communication, and strategic planning
My tenure at L3Harris was defined by a disappointing lack of professional growth opportunities. The company's potential for advancement was stifled by fierce internal competition and a disheartening trend of prioritizing family connections over genuine professional competence. A biased approach to promotions left little room for employees to progress or transition based on their skills and qualifications. In addition, the organization exhibited signs of disarray and disconnection. Communication between different departments was frequently unclear or absent, resulting in inefficiencies and confusion when attempting to complete projects.
Large corporation culture. Segments and divisions are still lacking “one company” outlook.
Disorganized in some cases High turnover/some areas have large age gaps Lacking in training opportunities
No matter what they tell you, they do not want help from ""outsiders"". Best advice, ply your craft somewhere you will be appreciated. Only those who started their careers at GVL are considered insiders. They need help, they are hiring for help... but in the end, you will be trapped in a cage of ""this is how we do it"".
Hard to advance. Lots of bringing in outside people instead of advancing internal candidates. Corporate culture changes are stifling. Leadership since the Harris takeover doesn't have a good grasp of the capabilities and missions of the L3 companies. Proposal development is a churn and takes more time than it should. ESG and DEI have become the core of L3Harris rather than the mission, technology, competency, and execution. Pay is decent but not enough to draw people to NE Texas 50 miles away from Dallas when most competitors are in DFW.
Lack of support from L3Harris corporate
Growing pains from the merger and questionable management leads to frustrating situations and low morale. Turnover is high and re-assignments happen all the time. Easy to get lost in the shuffle.
They try too hard to be ""cool"" and progressive.
Management has recently adopted a churn and burn strategy, coming up with arbitrary metrics which they will change retroactively however is needed to ensure that employees don't meet expectations, as well as giving only pitiful raises. They have been quite successful at getting rid of employees, achieving a quite high turnover rate. Furthermore, asking questions is often discouraged, stunting any attempts at collaboration or teamwork. In addition, internal R&D funding will be turned on and off in order to improve specific quarterly earnings reports, resulting in vital time-saving code sometimes having to be put on hold in order to make their short-term financials look better.
Organization structure and leadership slightly unorganized. Also cheap towards employees.
Employee morale is at the worst I've ever experienced and the worst my more experienced coworkers had ever seen it.
Bad when you are in between programs

Needed scheduled time to update team training materials to meet the changing protocols. Would like to see better documentation for new team members and those who may have needed remedial training. Could always use better budgeting by Leadership for this ongoing and required task.
Pay can be on the lower end.
Corporate red tape approval processes
Disorganized in some cases High turnover/some areas have large age gaps Lacking in training opportunities
They are too busy buying other companies. They do not have time for the employee, you are just a number depending on your program.
Benefits have been ransacked as cost saving opportunities. Bonuses killed off for the common folk, small perks and holiday parties are gone. Summer company picknick was free at a local amusement park with buffet lunch and prizes has turned into employees basically paying full price for entrance and lunch. Likely similar to many companies, but it's sad to see the corporate squeeze especially when they've been so profitable.
Not easy to connect with other interns

Salary could be more competitive, raises are determined less based on performance and more on how much you already make for your position level (pre l3 acquisition)
They are great at initial salaries, but the performance raises do not keep up with inflation.
Climate Lack of management New acquisition
Flex Time is only per week even though pay period is 2 weeks You have to work an 8 hour Friday cause your last 4 hours of a Friday is your first 4 hours the following week A little uncertainty with acquisition
Some not so cutting edge tech, but generally interesting digital comms wirk.

Big company with decent turnover
Employee morale is at the worst I've ever experienced and the worst my more experienced coworkers had ever seen it.
Poor decision making to consolidate vacuum device divisions that many warned against doing, leading to huge losses
Not room for much advancement.
They prefer to only hire 6 month Co-Ops because obtaining a security clearance takes months and if you only work a Summer you won't get the full ""top-secret"" experience. This can set you back on your graduation by a semester. If you're going to the Greenville location, make sure to try to book an apartment at Cross Timbers. The commute is less than 5 minutes to L3, and it's the nicest apartment complex in the area. $900-1500/mo
It depends on what segment and job area you’re in, but a big con for me is there is a big reluctance to change and trying new ideas. A lot of the old timers show zero interest in hearing ideas from new people and that can be very frustrating if you consider yourself an innovator. Also, there is practically zero tolerance for risk taking. Political correctness is quite extreme.
I was injured while working in the TR3 F-35 Engineering Lab at the HTC in Palm Bay. I required not one, but two surgeries. The second surgery workers compensation refused to cover, so I had to pay out of my own pocket and go out on medical leave through MetLife. During this time my HR representative who has extra chromosomes claims they attempted to contact me, which they did not, they should have gone through my MetLife representative anyways... and they told me I would be terminated if I did not respond. I responded to their correspondence, and they let me go anyways. Since then, I have been unable to get a job anywhere on the Space Coast.
Pay raises aren’t the greatest
MAGA bs from scrum master and others political talk at work. I am still waiting on my severance and hey my insurance being cut of immediately.
Inconsistent workload, poor culture, distant management
Slow to address issues, not enough decision makers
- Limited growth opportunities - a 1-year commitment to apply for other internal roles - Technology varies depending on the program
I hear there are no bonuses, but not confirmed yet
there are no cons to this company
Impossible expectations set by manager. Micro managing by clueless manager. Any simple obvious process changes take a full team of people who think they are important. You’re going to get used and replaced at any moment they choose. Brown nosing culture.
Being part of a large organization can sometimes inhibit moving quickly.
a lot of turnover lately.
The team you get put on can highly impact how satisfied you are with your work.
No bonus Bad yearly raises High turnover
Culture is very poor and layoffs are now common. They typically lay people off right before a major holiday or right after someone takes PTO. It is very, very shady how this happens. What is shown to the public and what really happens is very, very different. It really is like working for a company that has a bipolar disorder. For example, the Waco site used to advocate serving others in our community but this is no longer the case. The new leadership is against this because they see it as an expense because it does not ""bring money in the doors."" The C-suite types have killed this company and the culture that made it successful. Most of the people that were experienced have left or have been let go because they are a threat to the new regime. If you file an ethics complaint you will be targeted and laid off. Several of my work friends found this out the hard way. The software development practices are stuck in the early 2000s and if you try to advocate modern practices it is seen as hurting the bottom line. It is very sad what has happened to this once good company.
Wish that there were more clear paths to career growth here. I don't want to stagnate and being a new grad many other companies are offering much more appealing things like advanced growth plans.
none that i can think of
The future may not be bright for this company and it is reflected in the culture and defeatist attitudes of many employees. Questionable senior leadership and financial decisions, most R&D is spent on keeping old programs alive; extreme amount of cash spent on trying to buy ""disruptive"" companies and inorganically grow; most synergies not realized as many of the companies are in their own silo.
In this role the work is never truly done. You will be reworking the same customer proposal for years. You get to see all the money our government wastes on things they don’t need.
Heavy environment depending on what building you work or what role you are performing.
There's been lots of inefficiencies since the split between Global and Defense and the merger with L3 and legacy Harris. Overall, it's a decent place to work. As always, it matters where you sit in the organization too. Some people love it. But, the majority are overwhelmed and overworked.
- Software support roles (e.g. DevOps) have very limited career paths - Upper management is not in touch with its employees - Many employees are pretty disengaged
culture from the top-down is rigid/inflexible
There is not very good training material on how to do my job, so most of my learning is me having to ask other people which can make me feel like a bother to people who seem busy. I don't always feel very challenged at work and it can seem boring.
Pushing for return to the office Changes to work responsibilities creating unfeasibly demanding expectations

Leadership, specifically program leaders, are not understanding of a need for flexibility. Too many leaders stay in role/people with the same mentality just are moved around at the top so there is minimal leadership actually pushing for positive changes. Very cliquey. Old school mentality with leaders who struggle with new ideas. ""Butt in seat"" thought process by all. Have spent a lot of time recruiting new talent only to lose them within 2 years due to lack of advancement opportunities. Leaders are taking the company years backwards with forcing certain roles back into the office, which will only continue to all soon enough.

Pay raises aren’t the greatest
Inconsistent workload, poor culture, distant management
*End of quarter rush *Disorganization at all levels *New product development is laughable *Young engineer training ground until they are offered a better paying job *Toxic colleages *Pay needs to be more competative
Slow to address issues, not enough decision makers
- Limited growth opportunities - a 1-year commitment to apply for other internal roles - Technology varies depending on the program

Lots of attrition problems. Lower than average salary and slow to promote.
No negative comments during my time of employment
But seems to face normal challenges of Big Corp.
Hot as heck Slow moving
Hard to advance due to the severe nepotism.
Easy to get lost in the crowd. Seems to have an old boys mentality where people who have been here get promotions before those who have experience. Pay raises have been pretty poor ~2% for those who meet expectations and 3% for exceed which cause people to jump around to other places to get pay increases. For those starting out you need to make sure you try to guide your career and what you want to do as you can assigned to menial tasks which does not give you the experience to do what you really want to do. There is a plethora of work here and not all of it requires a clearance yet in job openings it is listed that you must be able to get a clearance. It takes a very long time to get things done here due to process and procedures. The company does not really look for / ask for ways to improve the way we do things. There seems to be a divide between the upper management and us low people on the totem pole. I don't expect them to be our buddies but it would be nice if they came around and met people, shook their hands, talked to them on a personal level and asked what the company could do to improve and or move forward. For those who are handicap you have to jump thru hoops to get campus drive on permission to park in the handicap spaces inside the fence. If you are handicap this should be far easier and widely known that this is an option!
Hierarchy makes it difficult to work. Redundant work flows waste time and add no value.
Expected to work beyond 40 hours without overtime, potential layoffs, lack of training for most positions
Though jobs are listed as Hybrid, it's dependent on your manager whether or not you can actually WFH. Very little focus on retention. Work can get very boring.
They sell the position as a challenging position, but in reality the Engineering team wants a call center type of environment for admins.
Upward mobility / salary growth can be slow for experienced employees
I had to make other arrangements and was able to quit recently since our last performance review was very disheartening. I am not one to air out my dirty laundry because when it comes to a job the work is my main focus. I have many years of experience in this field and took the job at L3 after leaving my previous job to move back home and take care of my disabled sister, we could not afford any other living arrangements. This is the most I have shared about my personal life other than when my supervisor asked I do not have children. Sorry I choose to play it safe. Who would have ever thought this would play a role in my experience and how I am rewarded. I bring a lot of talent, and amongst my coworkers and own supervisor I had the best attendance record. I was regarded highly by everyone I work with. When it comes to reviews my actual performance did not make any difference in the salary increase that I received. The confusing part about all this is that in every review my supervisor undermined my performance with sad awkward attempts at being empathetic over the average salary increases with comments about when I do have children it is a lot of responsibility, or when I do purchase a home there are a lot of unexpected costs. This is supposed to make me feel better? First of all I sold MY home at a LOSS and moved back to this state and my family’s home to take care of them. Children?? What does that have to do with my performance? Get bent. Are you saying that my coworkers with less experience and who perform at a lower level qualify for the same salary increase and have received promotions for reasons that aren’t exactly clear, because they were promiscuous?? This is mediocrity at best. My supervisor was actually nice but unproductive, and dumb.
New hires receive same wage as somebody that has been working there for over 20 years. Hard to get promoted
Military overseen projects tend to get people stressed.
Overall company has good culture and leadership, but the group within lacked strategic leadership and direction, had poor culture, and leadership did not value employees
Slow. Boring. Old technology. Avg age is too high
Not interesting work, not great if your ambitious, slow raises
Very difficult to move up the company latter. Internal salary bumps don’t match the market rate, so basically the longer you stay the further below the market average you become.
As with any large company/organization, there are always going to be areas needing improvement. Key among them for L3Harris would, in my opinion, be in regards to their compensation schedule & health insurance offered to employees. Regarding compensation, it often seems they do not take into account where a majority of employees live. The site itself is located in a much smaller city/county with a much smaller tax base, where it is also much cheaper to live. As such, many employee salaries are based on cost of living close to the site instead of where employees actually live and pay for things. Yet a majority of site employees commute at least 30-45 minutes (or more) every day from the DFW Metroplex...where it is quickly becoming VERY expensive to live. For example, a 3BR house only 2-5 miles from the site might cost $300K, whereas the exact same house would cost $500K or more in a city located 30-45 miles away (e.g. McKinney, Rockwall, Royse City). As such, L3Harris has not adjusted their compensation schedule to reflect the drastic cost of living increase, especially over the last two years with higher inflation, fuel price volatility, etc. Furthermore, while 401k match and the employee discount programs are great, the health insurance package offered by the company needs to be reevaluated. Having previously worked at a much smaller company that generates far less profit than a major defense contractor, it stands to reason that the health insurance offered by L3Harris would be much better, but that is NOT the case. As a single person with no dependents, I chose to forgo the PPO option in favor of one of the two ""High Deductible Health Plan"" options because it required less money be taken out of my biweekly paycheck. Yet with my HDHP, I'm still paying a significant biweekly amount, while also having an annual deductible of over $2K dollars before my insurance kicks in. The company does contribute $250/year to my HSA, but that amount is measly compared to other similarly-sized companies. As a relatively healthy person, I don't need to visit doctors very much, but I do see a couple of specialists for various issues and take prescription medications. I also experience issues that most people deal with on occasion...cold, flu, sinus infection, etc...which don't require serious treatment but still make an office visit necessary. Yet while the HSA funds can typically afford the cost of most medicine, it can't cover the costs of sickness office visits, specialist office visits or the monthly blood tests I'm required to have for one of my medications. I'm forced to pay out of pocket for EVERYTHING until meeting my annual deductible, and those are costs I really can't afford because I don't make a high enough salary to cover the costs of where I live. So yeah, when I say the health insurance benefit is atrocious, I mean it. It's also painfully obvious that health insurance plans are structured to benefit employees with families/dependents rather than, or in addition to single individuals.
Move too slow - especially with hiring and promoting, recent reductions in investing in innovation.
- Very low annual raises (around 1 - 3%) - Executive leadership is out of touch with employees

They do a lot of amazing work, have great benefits, and remote work went smoothly.
Cutting-edge research, opportunities for educational advancement, great exposure to the world of clinical research.
Nice environment; light workload; perfect for transition.
good student job learning opportunities
Being a RPC at Hopkins School of Medicine is an interesting experience and good for a gap year type of job. If you are proactive you can be exposed to many aspects of clinical research
Nice facilities, comfortable offices with doors that close. A wonderful fourth floor reading room.
Frontline of Academic research. Professors and colleagues are highly experienced in their fields. Fantastic opportunities to collaborate with industry. Opportunities to mentor students
If you find a good team to work with, it is easy to stay for years. I am very lucky to have found a great and supportive team to work with at the School of Public Health, unlike when I was first started at School of Medicine. The pay is not competitive but other benefits (like being eligible for PSLF) are great.

","Stressful and sometimes lack of communication
I feel that the sector I worked in did not have a great on-boarding or training implementation. Even though I had a Senior programmer analyst, which is supposed to be someone I could reference when in need of assistance, they were working in a completely different sector. Thus, I was never able to use them as a resource to progress my work when I needed assistance. I was let go after my probationary period was up because I wasn't learning the industry fast enough despite my best efforts to learn without the proper support.
Hopkins has good benefits, but there is a discrepancy when comparing staff and faculty positions. Base pay at the hospital and university is less than that of other hospitals and universities in the area.
low wage; no benefit; prefer onsite students.
very hard to get paid on time
it is very hard to advance here and the salary's are abysmal for coordinators. They care more about how long you have been there than how much effort or initiative you take. It is discouraging to be treated as so replaceable rather than them investing in people who would like to grow a career
Low pay. Parking is expensive. A joyless culture. Opportunity for position and or/academic advancement is totally dependent on the needs, temperament, and management skill of the individual professor/investigator for whom you work. Little or no recognition for successes or excellent work. Many will keep you where you are if you are doing well, rather than support or help you in your career aspirations. This was a big surprise. If you go to work for one of those, be ready to endure, feeling time slip away, or explore other opportunities without understanding or encouragement.
Work might take longer hours than you expect.
Dealing with HR can be a nightmare, and as a hiring manager I have to interact with them a lot. The procurement system is also difficult at times to work with. The decentralized model at JHU is complicated to navigate, but if you can deal with that it isn't the worst place to work.
- I enjoyed my experience in the role
- I enjoyed my experience in the role
This position has a few periods of inactivity.
Academia is academia. Slow to adopt and get things done. Administration needs some big help with organization.
I was barely given a raise over the course of 5 years, certain faculty members and research management were abusive. I was screamed and cursed at at one point over a simple miscommunication
This organization needs to increase their pay scale for employees.
Little to no room for advancement.
place is in the crowded city
Baltimore is not that great.
Pay is not adequate for a full time office job in this area and there is no ability to get pay raises. Most of my coworkers have to take second jobs to support themselves.
Low income for a lot of work
It just a teaching assist position. Don't expact to learn something.
none I can think of
Again depends on the advisor but there can be struggles with graduating, micromanaging, or overall philosophy in how the lab is run
The pay is not as much
Overworked and underpaid, no one is happy
There were no cons, I had an amazing experience.
Lack of management training for PIs Horrendous stipend that barely meets the standard of living
Competitive work environment Nothing else
Low paid, heavily silo’s, no clear business approach e.g Lean Six Sigma, lots of redundancy in services and a lack of holistic care for patients. Also has a lot of old buildings and facilities. Really poor promotion opportunities internally and they underpay every level of staff member and burn them out until they leave.
Sometimes it can be time consuming
Location and transportation may be a challenge

My professor was not a great lecturer so the student relied a lot of the TAs which was not always easy since we are not experts.
Location and transportation may be a challenge
lack of communication. unclear roles sometimes.
The pay is poor, and the administration strikes me as pretty incompetent. Many of the instructors seem to really lack the requisite qualifications to be teaching what is marketed as college level classes. The administration seems more concerned about following a bunch of inane rules and practices than about the quality of instruction. I wouldn't recommend working for CTY.
While $30 is quite good for RA pay - it is still very low relative to industry pay (I provide statistical consulting for a tenure-track professor).
Bureaucratic, many steps to get simple things done
Administration can be horrible people
There's a lot of bureaucracy, and the speed with which some work moves through the system seems slow.
School is honestly very hard
School is honestly very hard
everyone is highly competitive and works hard
Pay is very uncompetitive in School of Engineering
Facilities are poorly kept, should keep employees WFH if EVS is always understaffed and unable to keep Facilities clean.
I love to cook for people
- Long hours - Sometimes extremely long hours.
None at this moment, thank you.
location is a little bit dangerous
Racist no support rude patients rude doctors Bad administration
- Medicine is notorious for being significantly below market rate for pay - Extremely high turnover in HR and can be difficult to get guidance and assistance - Quality of leadership varies depending on department and school
None that I can think of at the moment
low pay nothing else I can mention, I love to work here
they could pay better salaries
They could pay tutorial assistants more.

A lot of red tape
Low pay rate not competitive in the current job market
Small, sometimes unorganized group with inconsistent hours
Hard to balance work with school
No retirement benefits (great health insurance)
Low base salary at jhu
But it did have its problems
Experience highly dependent on the professors.

too much presure and timing

High volume of cases and demanding faculty.

So much work. No assistance provided she. I asked for help. I even came up with solutions
DMC student staff are paid the same as the rest of student workers, despite the job requiring advanced skills and an ambitious work load.
A lot of red tape
Supervisor micromanaged, screamed at me once A lot of work Low pay
Work life balance needs to be improved
Low pay rate not competitive in the current job market
Small, sometimes unorganized group with inconsistent hours
Illegal forced overtime for non-exempt employees. Some employees with connections do little and collect a paycheck, others without connections are treated as disposable work horses. Outdated softwares which makes work more difficult than need be. Most employees are passive aggressive and just out for themselves, which makes cooperative tasks more difficult. Long -term staff employees seem over-medicated or in a daze and sadly, they begin counting years to retirement when they are barely 40 and have many years to go. Pay is not competitive, and JHU fully expects a 2yr revolving door for many employees; little or no effort to retain. In fact, they rather you leave so they can get fresh faces and pay them a pittance until they, in turn, leave. This is why JHU has such an entrenched reputation as a place to get on your resume and leave; it is very difficult to stay with rising living costs and virtually no raises, or a tiny token raise. JHU pretends to be broke when dealing with rank and file employees, though the money flows like a river to managers and pet projects. Parking is a nightmare if you do not have a special faculty parking spot, and expensive too, even through JHU parking office.
Low pay Long hours High stress

Working in a gym. If you are into fitness
Great opportunity to start in the field without experience. They gave me a chance when I started. I was a member and became an instructor.
As the OM you have no direct boss to answer to in the club. Chain of command is loose and somewhat confusing. All communication is done via the phone/computer network. Interacting with members can be fun at times but awful at others.
Decent training and opputunity for growth
member appreciation promotes healthy lifestyle interactive
You have the opportunity to build a team that will contribute to your success here.
When I started, I had a great director. He knew the different aspects of training and we were able to coordinate varies clients with specific needs with appropriate trainers. For general clients, we spread them out evenly.

decent pay, flexible hours, make connections
","The company culture was difficult to navigate.
A con I would say is the hours, you can only work some hours everyday as the OM is mainly there in the morning unless you open up the gym and then you can only work that time until the OM gets there. I wish there could be 2 people at the front desk always
- long hours, pay isn't all that great if you're not selling -sometimes higher up managers push ethical limits - sales. all the company cares about is sales.
They treat you very poorly Poor pay structure for so much work Very cutthroat environment
pretty much every thing else
The managers will fire you for literally everything It’s a negative and aggressive workplace environment Male managers and custodians like to joke about causing physical harm to others especially their female counterparts.
No cons overall great experience
No advancement unless you know someone higher up
The pay rate is not the best
understaffed there is only one person at front desk
100% co-workers is what ruined this job for me. I was offered lower than what the ad said, I didn’t get a van. They said maybe after 6 months of working. The two guys training me had the worst habit of micromanaging me and their toxic masculinity was palpable. Everyday I had to deal with their agro attitudes. One of them actually tried to scold me when I took a longer lunch to go and vote in the midterm elections. I explained to him that it’s the law and him trying to prevent me from going is e legal. This annoyed him even more but he was a Trumper so it didn’t take much to make his brain melt when challenged with facts and reason.
- pay - hours - commute (a vp has the right to move you to a different location) - you feel the stress of not hitting goals - you have to deal with unruly member’s occasionally
-The general manager of the space didn't put much care into his employees, focus seems to be in sale team and numbers
Collections that are cap at a no value price!
None that I can think of
Low pay with not enough floor hours to make money
Decent hours as well as pay
Long hours and no breaks allowed
No room for growth outside of sales and pay has gotten worse
Members can be extremely rude but it doesn't happen all the time. Sauna's were always down but now corporate seems likes they are getting rid of them at the moment because they were permanently shut down for no reason at the moment.
staffing, had to play many roles for the same pay, and upper management is always looking for a reason to fire you
Low pay Unrealistic goals Product sold (gym membership) isn’t that good Maintenance is nonexistent Forced to sell by contract
pretty much every thing else
Rude gym clients smelly weird
Base pay is very low, if you want make money you have to make sales
a little hard to make the transition to master trainer. wish the management helped a little more with that transition but it wasn't terrible
They needed a kid they can mold into the cushion of the seats?!?sears?!?! I like to work smarter....
Difficult to deal with people who stay past closing, plus you do not get paid when people stay late

There can be drama at work
Very difficult to have a work life balance. Should have better benefits. Constantly having to push and drive team with a little incentive from upper management.
Low pay with not enough floor hours to make money
Low pay, hard to get bonuses, lots of outdoor sales
Discriminates very demanding long hours mental health pressure
There are no cons for la it is a good job
Low pay; Little to no training; rude customers
Long hours and no breaks allowed
No room to escalate in the corporate rankings
not as many hours as i wanted
“Guests” this is still apart of the service industry as you are constantly around people and they do ask questions… or assume you don’t speak English since you’re a a janitor.
lower pay sit in one spot low hours
Biggest downside is the pay structure
Lower pay scale, tough to get raises. Equipment issues happen
The schedule will run your life
Operations receive low pay. Gym customers are occasionally rude.
If you don’t get the proper training, it can be initially challenging. However, if you have an immediate superior and an outgoing personality you will be fine.
Waiting for all the clients to exit the gym after it is closed
Management is abusive at best. Regional management uses intimidation and verbal abuse to bully staff into making their monthly quota. The regional manager once slapped the desk and yelled at me because I didn’t make enough of the renewals.
Poor compensation, no staff break area or bathroom, understaffed locations, minimal/no paid holidays. Expected to perform management duties while simultaneously being a front desk attendant and glorified debt collector. Very high turnover for this position.
High turnover rate. New employees every 3 months throughout all positions from front desk to general manager. Serious complaints never get addressed or properly handled.

Stressful work environment often little support
The Kids Klub is by far the worst part of this job
Awful scheduling, no freedom to actually manage the facility, extremely rude & insensitive corporate, no retirement plan, and no raises. I was berated and harassed by members and corporate did nothing about it. There is nobody to cover shifts if someone calls out since only one person can be scheduled at a time.
-obligated to cold call the entire time you're at front desk posing as the billing department to have people update their payment information that clients are continuously dodging - not to blame them because LA fitness makes it impossible for their members to cancel their memberships. It's all intentional and it's all an inside joke that everybody is aware of this fact. - most locations struggle to keep janitorial on staff, the gyms do not get cleaned like they should after hundreds of people use the equipment. I don't even believe in covid but I am a germaphobe and I suggest not using a UV light to see how gross everything is. -nothing gets fixed in proper time frame, this company has a mega budget to play with yet everyone they contract takes their time to get one thing fixed- it annoys the club members and they become hostile towards you- it's funny but annoying to have to calm adults down.
Lack of training to much work load for little pay
High turnover rate. New employees every 3 months throughout all positions from front desk to general manager. Serious complaints never get addressed or properly handled.
Not great benefits, not ideal for families
Pay, dealing with meat heads getting mad at each other.
They won't repair equipment or AC at many locations. Some locations receive attention but many don't. There are some locations that are in extreme disrepair. Training isn't held often enough and they don't pay for many certifications. Raises aren't given almost at all, you have to ask and then they are nominal.
Having to clean up the sales teams' messes. Their bosses give them direct orders to disobey company rules and standards. Another con is having to deal with upset members due to sales team.
Success dependent on location and gym type.
can not keep weight on too much cardio dirty job not appreciated by the company
This department is time consuming, you will work 40+ hours weekly.
General leadership is very broad and open. It's a sales job. The new leadership I had succeeded because he attacked weak points and also threatened folks so they were intimidated to sign up. Not something I stand behind.

Not for experienced trainers Pay is low Management is a joke System is a joke
Horrible staff, management doesn’t care about you
Minimal training angry members and minimal help from managers depending on shift.
Terrible business model created for business not for clients to succeed
Higher ups are really out of touch in terms of what works nowadays
Boring, Slow, Micromanaging, Worker Biases,
Work life balance, great for individuals who want to relocate.
Variable & split shift hours were not ideal.
La Fitness as a company is disappointing, they have non gym people make decisions for gym people. ie: corporate wants to add a kickboxing class to a gym that’s been begging for Olympic platforms. (This gym is one of their most successful gyms btw)
No yearly salary increase, bonus only if you meet monthly goal,
All about sales and reups for customers
Reaching a quota on a daily basis.
Low pay, time theft, short shifts, not good for long term
Our fees for the asset recovery services will be based on a percentage of the total amount successfully recovered. The specific percentage will be detailed in a separate fee agreement.
everything else low pay not enought equipment horrible management
Ridiculous hours, like 70 a week, unrealistic goals and expectations, aggressive micro management. No benefits AT ALL
Mostly poor leadership that manages through the most effective form of leadership - intimidation (...just kidding). You're only as good as last month's sales metrics, regardless of factors beyond your control, and your boss will not hesitate to remind you of that. Training staff is usually under-qualified and ill-informed on client retention practices which leads to higher than desirable attrition rates.
Rude employees. Never get a raise. Pay us below minimum wage as a manager.
Lack of training to much work load for little pay
-They expect you to do a lot for not much pay. Minimum wage to sell memberships, training programs, and not to mention they want 40-60+ phone calls from you a day. They also expect you to use your own vehicle to go out marketing and not even compensate you for the gas you use. If I was getting paid even 2-3 dollars more per hour I’d probably be more driven to perform better.
Late or really early shifts
-Long hours. -...that's pretty much it.
Can be unethical Motivation through negativity Forced overtime
Upper management unrealistic expectations and low pay
Pay and long hours and the threshold is to high to reach bonus until you get into management levels
Keeping consistent client base pay is hard.
Hours weren’t consistent or honored, Customers complained to you about things that the trainers or membership services were in charge of
Horrible staff, management doesn’t care about you

-Getting a paycheck -Meeting new people is the best part of the job. In addition to meeting people you are provided with videos and online assessments to help you understand how vehicles work which helps people that are new to the industry.
Interesting industry with a long track record of success. Store managers can hire whoever they want without too much interference from the DM. The store teams tend to skew towards mostly cool people who want to succeed. Rapid turnover makes it easy for TM's who are good and want to move up to do so, but sadly but only to the GM level.
Management is nice, customers are nice everyone is nice and it’s a nice job, I get to sit and rest, get paid well and have a very accommodating manager.
You learn about cars, car parts automotive technician stuff and car technology and operations management.
Kept busy, interacting with people. Learned from team members about auto parts.
Good beginner job to have and it can help you gain some knowledge on the auto industry.
None that I can think of.
Customer service is the number one priority at Advance Auto Parts. Every customer is treated with the highest respect and dignity, regardless of automotive background or expertise. My co-workers were some of the best people I've ever worked with.
Pay (management) Usually friendly customers.
Autonomy, pay, leadership, opportunities and benefits
When you get into management they do pay decently with monthly commission that is typically a couple hundred bucks or even more depending on how well your store does in that months period. You hit your targets and the store meets over all youll be looking at a pretty decent bonus. As a General Manager my bonuses were typically 1200-1400$.
You are able to learn every machine there, like the electric pallet jack , RC (electric forklift), RM(high low), SP, and a electric pallet Jack. The base pay after 3 years is $23, and the overtime is mandatory so you average 55k to 60k. Which is more than any warehouse in comparison.
The work is very easy to pick up and and you will learn very quick
It was great, noie people
Customers are great to meet and help Very team oriented environment Managing a team is a lot of fun The processes is a lot of fun Business deals with commercial Owners is a lot of fun Running all faces of the operation is a lot of fun

You get multiple days off after jobs are done. You get to meet/ work with different people from different for the most part some(not all) are great guys to work with. You get to accumulate airline miles and if done properly hotel points.

Great working environment with Co-workers
Calm pace Sometimes busy Realy easy work
Pay, total compensation with fuel covered and benefits like health etc are good.
It's a job. Can be easy at times. Customers want everything for free and anyone that will work 10/hr is usually stealing, selling parts on the side or trading them for dope. Unless you are committed enough to be in the store 7a-9p everyday then be prepared to go through hell trying to figure out where all your parts are going. The frustration and lack of support from DMs causes most GMs to quit. Then the remaining employees that have been stealing the whole time puts the blame on you
","None that I can think of
-EXTREMELY HIGH EMPLOYEE TURNOVER SO BE PREPARED TO WORK AN EXTRA SHIFT WHEN SOMEONE CALLS OUT OR QUITS BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME NO ONE WANTS TO COME IN AND HELP. -No work life balance at all for the GM -Low starting pay for your store reps and drivers so you pretty much need to hire every straggler that walks in to keep the circus going.(QUANTITY NOT QUALITY) -Most of the employees are there until a higher paying job calls them. -The company puts share holders above all -No clear career path( some employees have been there over 10 years and still make less than $13/HR) -The company does not provide enough hours to get things done, you will be asked as a GM to stay and work for free since you are salary and only get paid for the 50 hours you work. In addition if you only work 49 hours you will be scolded but if you work 80 hours in a week you don’t even get a thank you.
Nearly every position that opens above GM is filled by outside candidates, and the very few internal candidates that do get promoted to DM or above get chosen via pretzel logic. For example, if you are a strong CPP or GM forget about a promotion. You are way too valuable where you're at to risk promoting you. If you are a slacker GM the skies the limit if you want it and you're a chosen one. If you can speak Spanish even better. Anyone over 40 need not apply to DM, at least not internal candidates anyway. The stores are open way too many hours. And forcing GM's to work 50 hours every week is silly and only fuels turnover for what the average salary is.
There’s one cowworker that I absolutely can’t stand but I can’t do anything about that
It's always the same thing bad apples spoil the bunch is a good saying and it applies to this situation. If you know you have someone in your org driving out employees and messing up operations, you don't promote them. You fire them.
Wanted to go part-time but never given opportunity. I explained that because I was receiving SSI my income had to be below a certain amount each month.
The only real con is that whoever you get as a manager can really make the difference if you wish to stay long-term or move on after a certain time.
You don't get to choose which deliveries you take and most of the time I ended up getting the heaviest ones which were also usually the shortest drives while everyone else got longer ones. Say you wanted to take a paint order that's 45 minutes away but has less traffic and is lighter, but oh wait there's an order to this one place that's in the same plaza and anything else that's six rotors or excessive. And of course everyone got to take the longer drives way more than I did and that doesn't even come close to being fair. This type of micromanagement stains Advance Auto Parts/CarQuest's name badly. Some of the managers had attitudes that were horrible, yelling at you or getting accusatory toward you for no reason. I had to read the delivery receipts because the managers don't let you know that you need to go somewhere to get an item for a delivery and often I didn't get anywhere to reading them. Lastly, say it's 30 minutes until you're off duty, but oh wait, there's some guy demanding a bunch of heavy rotors and other heavy materials to his place 30 minutes away or something. You're forced to work past your shift and you don't get paid extra.
Employees are not compensated fairly for the amount of sales they produce, or for going above and beyond for customers on a daily basis. You feel like you are ripping off customers with how obviously ludicrous most of the prices are. Corporate decisions seem like they have little or no input from the people actually at the lower levels.
Pay (if you're part time) Upper levels if company seem disconnected and greedy.
Health insurance could be better
Although its gotten alot better, to start employee's are slightly underpaid. The software we use needs a massive update. Otherwise its not terrible, just slow and crashes sometimes.
The start up is in the morning is 4am to 230pm and it’s brutal during overtime season. It’s hard to have time after work while being sleepy. They force you to help other departments because they are down which is , always selection.
Hard to get the hors you really want
No cons that i remember
Inventories use to be third party, Now GMs have to use their time inventorying another store instead of fixing their own DM’s set you with impossible goals and impossible standards and expect you to be perfect and punish you for doing so DM’s expect you to have 100% training but they don’t train you, you just learn on your own time and when you try to ask questions they do not answer the phone DM’s retaliate at the nearest scent of an opinion that is different from theirs DM’s coming into the store and calling things ugly or saying everything looks terrible when you spend 60-80 Hours a week fixing it without an off day. No Offdays or supervisors encouraging No off days, Supervisors encouraging damaging labor and no work life balance. Being blamed for every situation even if it can’t be helped or you weren’t even hired at the time of the event, or had no doing with it whatsoever
No comments on cons. It depends on yourself.
The general manager is abusive to me. There is much favoritism in our store. People who have just made manager are being paid the same as managers who have been managers for years and it's alright with them. I am constantly running shifts alone and told I have no right to complain. They do not care about our safety whatsoever. The store has been robbed at gun point and yet we have no security. Our store is hot like a plantation where slaves dwell. It is very stuffy and hot. I am bullied and harassed by my boss. I brought this to her boss and have been ignored. The employees are being played against each other. I am blamed for every mistake, every assessment that is failed. The store is treated as if it's a daycare the boss brings her child to work. I am accused of stealing because unfortunately I have become homeless while working there. I live in my car and she takes advantage of the situation. I am told how bad I look when I come to work and constantly belittled by my employer. I have considered suing but it not worth my time and money. I figured i would just put the abuse I am enduring on blast for all to see. I know they know who wrote it but I don't care. I can't wait to find employment elsewhere as I just can't take it no more. This is a messed up place to work. People get on camera stealing and get away because like I said there is rampant favoritism in our store.
The company fosters a lack of accountability for CPPs by counting returns against the store's sales goal and because of that CPP's do not like drivers returning parts although drivers are trained to ask clients with every visit. My store manager actually told me that if returns became a problem the client would call him, however, if it gets to that point how can the team maintain credibility? The sales deduction should occur retroactively, instead of count against the day they were processed in inventory so CPP's aren't afraid to take them. Some days, since the drivers who had been doing it longer than I had were conditioned to ignore returns, I would collect dozens of parts from each client and the day's sales would almost dip into the negative, this penalty makes CPP's and managers alike feel like the driver bringing the returns back is mean and not a team player and in my case I was reprimanded aggressively for this. Not once, but several times and this led to me having no choice but to walk out and avoid further verbal abuses. Even after filing a complaint with my manager's superior, nothing was done.
Equality and advancement are an illusion unless you know the right people and like being promised things they never deliver.
Typical corporate setting. Issues are higher ups are extremely disconnected from their market. Box checking and the company image has become more important than taking care of its customers.
Work you to death. You get left in the store by yourself and they don't care about your safety. Will not give out raises
Regional Manager doesn’t care about you Doesn’t pay well Hardly ever gets raise unless you persist
Everything depends on the district manager actually being helpful. The GMs are basically told everyday that they aren't doing enough to make sure every team member is trying to manipulate customers into buying things they don't need, signing up for the Speed Perks program, and maximizing the units per transactions. The GMs are overworked, everyone is underpaid and the stores need to get by with the minimum amount of hours to function, which usually leaves 2 employees in store, most of the day.
Currently my store has High turnover
Stock outages, or not enough product inside the store, example Hub bearing only 1 each car will have one on each side, for the benefit of the company there should be 2, another example only 1 can of paint on popular colors at least 4 cans and the we all would get the rewards of additional sales. And more money in our pockets.
Some people that come in should never touch a car in their life, they're that dumb
Customers can be annoying but most are cool
There's a limit to how much growth you can have at the company, it is very dependent on your district manager There are not many rules to protect the employees from unruly customers.
Customer interactions in what is still a retail environment.
Long hours, short staffing, low pay.
Benefits are lacking, expensive deductible or too high of premium cost for lower deductible plan. Promotions seem to be given to HR group easily but elsewhere not as easy.
communication is the worst I have ever experienced along with the fact that this company does not own anything that resembles auto parts or it uses multiple 3rd parties to operate as poorly as it does.
The know it all customer, and attitude of snobs in the community made it impossible for this veteran to tolerate stupidity. I’m the first to admit that I don’t know everything but I love to learn and if I don’t have the answers, I know who does and I will have the proper tools to help. Unlike most people these days that don’t care about the job, customer or service and will not respond when you have a problem.
Low pay, being told you make too much for the position you're in, but not being given the opportunity to move up
The leaders from corporate. Kristen solar. Junior word. Both in over their heads. Not even sure how they got where they are.
Customers can be degrading at times
Customers are garbage and ghetto. No complaints about coworkers/managers
There are no cons to report
If there are I haven't found any .

Manager lied while I knew the truth.
Promotion within company is not likely
Put your people first. You cant force Culture on someone, you have to live it. The VP's in the West have been a revolving door, and the Culture has completly gone.
They will give you the idea that when you travel you will be free to enjoy yourself and explore the different cities you'll be in as long as your job is complete but that is not true at all. You are expected to work 7am-6pm Wednesday to Wednesday (Thursday if I'm California) straight no days off even if ahead of schedule or completely done early, and if you aren't done you are expected to stay until it's done no matter how many extra days it takes. You will be micro managed and on your days off you will be expected to hand in reports answer all phone calls/ emails/ text, and possibly attend conference meetings so days off aren't really days off. Things are constantly changing and not all for the better of the workers. Of the 5 managers it is clear that 3 play favorites and in turn you will have some of the supervisors do whatever to throw anyone under the bus to make them look good. They have no loyalty to anyone, it doesn't matter if you've worked there 1 year or 20+ of they are ready to fire you they will make up any reason to fire you with no warning or real valid reason.
Schedule changes without being notified
The rules are stupid and they treat employees like crap.
Benefits are lacking, expensive deductible or too high of premium cost for lower deductible plan. Promotions seem to be given to HR group easily but elsewhere not as easy.
No overtime, horrible commission structure, employee turn over is high, base pay and starting hours are not even worth most peoples time. I watched a new employee get hired on part-time with 25-30 hrs get cut down to two days a week and then just quit showing up due to it costing more for them to come to work then what they were making on a paycheck. There is little to no communication from upper levels of management about structural changes that effect your bonus or pay. They have recently changed how commission is calculated which makes it near impossible for stores it rural areas to meet even the base line in order to make a small amount of ""extra money"". They don't give managers enough hours in order to retain good employees which in turn creates a resentful atmosphere within the store. The managers that are on salary are worked long hours and have to fill in for holes in the schedule. At times there are employees left alone in the store and are running it alone which I personal feel is unsafe.
lack of upper manage support to accomplish assigned goals
Customers can be degrading at times
Managers pick favorites which makes it annoying
Lack of management skills, poor employee treatment
Customers are garbage and ghetto. No complaints about coworkers/managers
Pressure to achieve unrealistic results given support
There are no cons to report
If there are I haven't found any .
Company has a high turnover
Lacks appropriate oversight by management. One person does all of the work while the others smoke or play on their phones. Once they see you’ll do it, everyone runs so that you have to continue.
To many task not enough focusing on customers.
Management style lacking, could be more included.
Pay and raises could be more... Customers are sometimes very hard to deal with.
Open on every holiday . Sometime short staff results in working way over schedule . Overtime only approved for certain people . You do have to buy your own uniform which is unfair. 3 write ups and your terminated . I often jd to sit people down and give them write ups for behavioral reasons .
Experience , customers service , and diversity
Training in the SE region was a joke and employees are taken advantage of to squeeze every last bit of productivity out. I lost 30 lbs working there due to stress.
Corporate culture is toxic. Targets set seem to be made up numbers with no basis in reality. You can be beating last years numbers by 5% and missing your target by 15%
low pay and unpredictable hours
No movement in position or raise of pay
Does not understand what part-time means.
Quality of life, especially as it relates to family may be affected without quality staff and good leadership.
They really try to Sell you during the interview process talking about how they're growing and expanding and all this potential Is core Grove. They put you with a good performing store with the assumption that that store manager is a good trainer when in fact it's exactly the Opposite, a good Location with good numbers does not mean that that ranch's manager necessarily it's a trainer.. The commercial guys are pretty good they have their own job and they stick to it , to do-it-yourself or is that coming every day I'm pretty upset and access basically training all retail people like crap.. Being hired as a manager in training you would think there would actually be a training program but none exist.. The district manager and the regional do the obligatory heads up when they're visiting they get their store up in perfect and then go back to normal operations when they're gone.. Trying to talk to these people are Literally impossible.. They have a computer system that's back from the stone age that constantly breaks down. They put a lot of emphasis in the training about culture and diversity but the exact opposite is practice in their stores.... At work in a few places in my life some retail but this definitely was not a good experience
Pay was a bit on the low side, even after talking to keyholders or ""managers"". They were cool but were getting paid a bit more than me, which was sad considering all the responsibility of the their position. Overall everyone needed a higher pay rate. Upper management from district could be great but could also get in the way of making business with local shops. As part time you get no benefits. And it's bi weekly paycheck.
Pretty much mandatory 10+ hour days, tough industry people are generally unknowledgeable about
Long hours that are scrutinized by your district manager
Extremely disorganized - continuous layoffs.
understaffed, may be hard to learn how each store is organized.
Pay increases can be hard to come by
Old computer system & point of sale system. Dysfunctional, communication can be lacking. Still trying to figure out what kind of business model they want to portray.
No real cons to speak of.
Treated like garbage by my coworkers, poor pay, expensive options
Bad pay. No forward movement.
Need better to have a better training program.
There are a lot of executives who will only promote or bring in a former friend or colleague. It makes for a very interesting discussion on favoritism and or just outright not bringing in different types of thought or talent. They are recycling the “PEPSI CULTURE “. If you worked for Pepsi - you’re ok.
Low pay barley enough to get by.
i could not choose my hours
Pretty boring job unless you enjoy moving things on shelves for most of the day
Pitiful pay and they think you want to change wipers and batteries in the snow and rain without even a car port. Sure who wouldn’t want to do that for a sub living wages. 😹
usually short staff no work life balance
Pay could be better lol
Being part-time, I did not have any priority in hours so if the location did not have hours that fit my schedule then I would not work that day and fill in as necessary.
GM are micro-managed you have to clock in for a salary position, for example. Computer systems are awkward and changes are untested in production environments. Corporate seems to have completely lost touch with the part of their business that interacts with customers and actually brings in revenue
It’s not what you know, but who you know.
Promote higher levels too much from outside
Low Pay compared to other companies
Pay is terrible Always confusion in management.
Highly toxic corporate finger pointing culture. If you like red tape and being stuck in a culture of all things dictated from behind the curtain then this is the place for you. Lots of box “checking”.
High turnover, low pay, working unreasonable hours

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Edward-Jones-Reviews-E3161.htm,"Extremely Flexible Schedule, work from home full time, great benefits and culture.
Culture can be good depending on the region.
No one knows how bad it really is at home office... yet. But I think the branches in the field know...
The role is 100% remote with the option to come into the office at any time. There is flexibility in how you plan/work your day. The firm offers bonuses & profit sharing. Although the home office employees have no idea what the metric is to meet to get a nice high bonus. Branch employees make more than is listed as a base rate because of bonuses. Benefits are ok, they need to be modernized though.
Great work atmosphere and I love our clients
-Company has been striving to give a ""voice"" to Branch Office Administrators in the past 2 years. -There is a ""caring culture"" where Regional employees support each other both career-wise and through any personal crisis situations.
Great in the beginning. They don’t pay very well but try to keep up with like jobs in the market. Nice atmosphere with the people there though.
Great culture, lots of training, support available and benefits.
Great company to work for.
Good firm, with great people, work only for one advisor
- I am extremely lucky to work with a financial advisor that sees me as a true partner in the branch. It is crucial to make sure there is a connection and common goals with the financial advisor before committing to working in a branch. - personal development (tuition reimbursement, designation opportunities, licensing) - tons of support (home office, other BOAs) - work/life balance - serving clients!
Work life balance; remote working; Development opportunities
- entrepreneur oriented - large support system - no day is the same - no cap on pay (performance based) - opportunity to build life long relationships
- Big investment in digital transformation. - Follow through on DEI initiatives. - Transparent business strategy. CEO and Sr. Leaders willing to respond to difficult questions in quarterly town hall. - Opportunity for fully remote
The company offers excellent training, home office support and growth opportunities. They are willing to train if you are a people person who cares about your contributions.
Great payout and training, amazing support.
Good work life balance and friendly people
Good work-life balance, meaning you only need to put in about 10-15 hours per week.

Very Flexible with the ability to grow depending on your FA Company has great benefits and wellness program
Free coffee, to be honest.
Great company to work for and benefits are extensive. I appreciate the company culture and the way they approach everything with excellence.
Flexibility and the work/life balance is very good. They have some very good benefits such as 16 weeks 100% pay maternity leave and great profit sharing! The ability to be a partner in the firm is probably the best benefit they offer. The bonus scale is very lucrative if your branch is profitable, dollar for dollar match up to 10% of the bonus profit. So if your branch bonus is $6000 and that’s your 10%, the firm gives you $6000 on top of that. Bonuses are a LARGE part of my pay being as high as it is.
Pay Flexibility Time off Tuition reimbursement Benefits
Good level or support, great work life balance, good culture

From a training perspective, Edward Jones is 5-star. They can -- and do -- teach any ethical go-getter from any background to be a Financial Advisor. The Region support to Advisors and camaraderie among them is unbelievably strong.
They are doing a great job of practicing what they preach even when it isn’t easy, and contrary to popular media.

The people are, by and large, simply awesome to work with. There is a team pervasiveness that breaks down silos and allows everyone to help and support one another. While morale might be low, there is still this sense of community among associates to help one another along the way.

","Can be slow-moving at times in terms of keeping up with industry but this is out of precaution not out of laziness.
low pay, they say you can work from home sometimes but that's not really not available for this position except in rare instances.
The systems are failing. They are doing a big push for a new software system but they are not training people on it. They are hiring a lot of new people but they are failing to train them. They systems are all very broken and the company does not keep up with the fixes. All of the software is outsourced and it almost feels like the third part is sabotaging us on purpose. The leadership is poor. The pay is very bad. The moral is bad. When I think of Edward Jones, I think of an apple that is rotting from in the inside. I do not see this company existing in 20 years. I just don't understand how you can run a company like this. All the leaders know this company is failing and are just there because its a job. nothing more. I am so disappointed. When they promote people it is all driven by politics and who they know. Talent and hard work is not what they are looking for at home office. Its a disgrace. FAs are leaving in droves.
The expectation that you spend all day on the phone is insane & draining. All calls to talent acquisition, and made by recruiters or consultants are recorded. The hiring managers are not told this so heaven help them if they are ever sued for saying or doing something inappropriate in an interview. There will be plenty of proof. Training is lazy.
- BOA pay is considered at market but they are comparing us to admin assistants. This job has a lot more responsibility than being an admin. They say that the BOAs are the backbone of the company but the pay is very low. I don’t know a single BOA that can afford their own housing. They all have a second income from their partner or have multiple jobs. Even those that are working in Level 9 and 10 offices which offer the highest bonuses. - high deductible insurance plan with expensive contracted pricing. The lowest deductible available is $3,850 for a single person. That might be ok for the financial advisors who make a substantial amount of money. However, one doctor’s visit could cost a week’s pay for a BOA. Many BOAs go without medical care because they can’t afford it under our plan. - if your FA leaves the company, you could be assigned to a lower level FA which greatly impacts your bonus so you could make less money than you originally made. - they only match $500 in the 401(k) which is laughable compared to other companies. - dead end job
-If you are not working with a Financial Advisor who is successfully growing his or her practice, your compensation will also not grow. The only way then for you to advance is to apply to interview with another more successful office when they have an opening. -The Financial Advisor decides how much of a branch office bonus to give you. Often times it will be based on if they ""like"" you and get along with you OR it will just be their opinion how they evaluate your performance. You will be writing up how you think you performed, but they have the final say. -Compensation for Branch Office Administrators is not keeping up with industry competitors or inflation. -There are always and continually a few Financial Advisors in each Region who have issues and can be abusive to their Branch Office Administrators. Corporate HR has to step in. Before accepting a job offer for this role, do your due diligence on this advisor's reputation within the firm.
If you have been there for more than 18 -20 years they try to displace you to another role in the firm or give you 6 weeks to find another job in the company. This is how they say they don’t do layoffs. Worked there over 20 years and saw it again and again. You now see they are down to 35 on best places to work. They had been in the top 10 for years. It’s dropping rapidly! They are also losing advisors but do apparently have a good hiring plan in place. We shall see if it works.
Red tape and inflexibility from HQ. My rating is despite me loving to work at EJ, because compensation and advancement opportunities matter, and the rest cannot make up for it. Even if you find a great branch and a great FA who wants to hire you for a permanent position, expect to go through the entire application, interview and training process again and expect HQ to try to talk your FA out of their ""readiness"" to hire you. The FA has to go to bat for you and justify their branch's need for your position. For job duties you are already performing and proving yourself with and your opportunity to have more input in business planning, participate in regional activities, have performance reviews and opportunities for raises, basically not to be treated like a second-class employee and non-factor within the firm. I don't recommend this path if you want to be able to advance. You'll see that Edward Jones received accolades for their bump in pay scale across the board for BOAs and that does not apply to on-call BOAs, so you'll be looking at a lower pay scale on top of what feels like gatekeeping and disrespect.
None come to mind today. Ask me tomorrow.
Low Pay - the pay structure needs to be revamped. If you get in an office with a new/newer FA, you will be doing the same work as BOAs in high-producing offices who are getting large bonuses and you will get little to none. The base pay is not enough to live on, so you need to be in a high-producing office. No Career Path - The only bump up is Senior BOA, and it's not much of a step up. EDJ doesn't allow its BOAs to be licensed, taking away an opportunity to help the FA in more ways (doing their trades) and earning more pay and providing more satisfaction for motivated people. Bonuses - Split of the office bonus is left up to the FA, so even if you do 50% of the work to get to the bonus, the common % to the BOA is 10%. HR Favors the FA - If you get into an office with an FA that is difficult to work for or abusive it will be a ""he said/she said"" situation because there are only 2 of you in the office, and HR always favors the FA because they bring in the revenue. Benefits are Terrible - The only health plan is a high-deductible plan. While the premium is not bad, the combined premium and deductible cost to be able to even use the health plan is @ 40% of a BOA's salary if they are in an office where they don't get bonuses. You also won't have money to participate in the 401(k), A Case of The Haves and the Have Nots - if you want great benefits, a baseline salary that's more than a BOA, amazing free trips, low commission targets, lots, and lots of support, lucrative partnership opportunities, millions of dollars of accounts handed to you so you don't have to bust your butt prospecting, no one your back about meeting quotas, being revered by the firm, your own office and your own dedicated support person, (unheard of in other firms), become an FA instead. It's a much, much, better job with no pressure to perform like at other firms, and very, very lucrative with very little effort.
- can be isolating if you don't like working alone or with one other person, however there are new opportunities to work in offices with multiple FAs and several BOAs. - some of the technology can be frustrating, but they're working on it.
Na- None at this time.
- heavy regulation (common in industry) - potential long hours 40-60 on AVG - high stress dependent upon multiple economic and clientele situations.
- A lot of new employees mixing with older and slower business practices - Supposedly pays under industry standard but pays better than a lot of non-financial or top tech companies - The need for consensus agreement and inclusion on strategic decisions means slower to-market delivery - a lot of leaders get hired as Partners which seems to create friction with more veteran employees
It's all a matter of what financial advisor you work with. It can make or break the job. Even thought the Branch Office Administrator works for the company of Edward Jones the financial advisor is the one who dictates the day to day environment and completes the BOA's annual job appraisals, merits and growth opportunities. FA's are by nature very controlling. They need more accountability when it comes to how they manage their BOA's.
High insurance costs, and no company retirement match.
Promotions don’t come by easily
The quality of work is generally lower than you would get at other Fortune 500 companies. Upper management is awful. Our Director in Firm Analytics brags about skipping work to go golfing, boasts about being 'un-fireable' as he knows too many prominent partners, and is just not a smart person in general.
None that I can think of
Not great was not great
Not great was not great
FA's have no idea what they are doing and home office is no help when you have an issue.
This job will take and take and take.
Management would rather hire new people than promote from within. Many Sr Leaders are new and the original culture is quickly eroding.
Horribly underpaid. I make $21/hr when mcdonalds STARTS OFF at $19/hr down the street. 90% of the BOAs are white woman (most above 50) and 90% of the FAs are white men. It's a corporate culture that seems to take advantage of half of their workers for the benefit of the other half.
No real career path in branch. FA has complete say in your bonus an can be stingy. A high level FA will probably make $300-$500K while the BOA does all the work and makes $50-60k.
If you don't have an interest in the finical side of things there really isn't much growth.
The amount of stuff you're expected to do is staggering for the miserable pay.
The pay for branch office administrators… Which is mostly women… is lower than it should be. Edward Jones talks a lot about how highly they value BOA’s and how we are basically partners in the business. The pay level does NOT reflect that for many in that role. Only at the highest levels.
The pay. They worry about over paying us and don’t seem very concerned with underpaying us. When you become registered/licensed with a Series 7 or 66 you’re limited on how you’re able to use the licenses, but also no additional compensation for becoming licensed. The disconnect with the field and the HQ seems as bad as it has ever been. They claim to “hear us”, but the actions aren’t following OR they say that in reaction to backlash about a policy/benefits/updates. It’s frustrating for the field to say something for years only to be told “no” and then a big thing happens and forces the firm to go in the direction they kept saying “no” to. Technology is also very frustrating, but major progress in the updating of technology.
I guess depending on your financial advisor really depends on how well you’ll enjoy your job
Technology is primitive, slow to make changes to keep up with the industry.

Horribly underpaid. I make $21/hr when mcdonalds STARTS OFF at $19/hr down the street. 90% of the BOAs are white woman (most above 50) and 90% of the FAs are white men. It's a corporate culture that seems to take advantage of half of their workers for the benefit of the other half.
No real career path in branch. FA has complete say in your bonus an can be stingy. A high level FA will probably make $300-$500K while the BOA does all the work and makes $50-60k.
Your BOA makes or breaks your success and your career. The BOA works for the Home Office, and is well protected by the Home Office. It is next to impossible to terminate an underperforming BOA, even when they are grossly negligent (executing trades without Advisor direction, depositing money to wrong accounts, or violating client confidentiality. Sadly, I know a number of Advisors who left EDJ because of this.
They still have a long way to go but companies like Edward Jones are the future of ways of working!
They still have a long way to go but companies like Edward Jones are the future of ways of working!
Leadership changes frequently and culture is starting to as well.
The DEI is getting really out of control
The amount of stuff you're expected to do is staggering for the miserable pay.
Your experience will vary widely dependent upon your direct supervisor.
Change has been historically slow. Outdated leadership techniques are difficult to remove from our day to day. We have many who duplicate efforts and we get in our own way.
The pay rate is pretty inflexible
There are no cons I have to share!
Poor company structure The FA I worked with was not a good manager, and did not care or talk much with me throughout the day. Very hands off and left it up to me to figure out my role. The job description was vague, and did not clearly define what the position would be. The daily tasks were easy to finish within 30 minutes, and had nothing to do most the day. The other office gal would talk about me through teams chat to some other coworker & hr did nothing about it.
no room for growth small office
It’s hard work starting out to build your business and finding enough people you can help.
I can’t think of any unless you don’t like working in a small office.
Medical coverage isn't terrible but also isn't great
I was hired at the home office a few years ago, and I can tell you I've noticed a sharp decline in the morale since that first day. In an effort to modernize, Jones has invested HEAVILY in technology for the branches, which is definitely needed. However, they have also HEAVILY invested in bringing in new leadership at the Partner level. Making $1M at least in annual salary, many of these new GPs are bringing in new ideas and new perspectives on culture, much of which is corroding the trust and honesty that has been a part of Jones for the past 100 years. A curtain of secrecy is being woven as the months go by to further separate leadership and associates. One issue the Firm has danced around for quite some time is that many associates are upset that new associates are getting hired in for identical jobs, but at $5-10K over veteran associates' salaries. Instead, the Firm is focused on pouring money into tech, remodeling the executive floor at Corporate, pouring money into free travel opportunities for financial advisors, and paying its multitude of GPs their millions. The result of these decisions was on full display during the recent Home Office Townhall, when GP David Chubak responded to associate questions about bonuses and fair compensation in what can only be described as a ""dress-down"" lecture with the clear message of, ""Be thankful you have a job, sit down and shut up."" Ironically, he even gave this little speech perched in his office overlooking Central Park in NYC, an office signed and paid for by Jones. Yes, Jones needs to modernize. Yes, new voices and ideas from new associates are needed. But the current morale and feelings of discontent extends from the home office to branch offices and clearly shows they are not implementing modernization or new ideas effectively. Of course, if the intention is to silence what has always been transparency between associates and GPs, then bravo, Jones - you are doing that quite well.
Salary goes down 5% every 3 months. They charge you training if you leave before 3 years.
Unrealistic quotas and deadlines after training period
Door knocking is very difficult when starting your business
Can't think of any at the moment.
Sometimes lacked support in the office
Lousy pay for amount of work expected and we constantly are reviewing ourselves.
Lousy pay for amount of work expected and we constantly are reviewing ourselves.
Only 2 weeks of vacation. People constantly watching you and your Metrics.
- Very much a who you know business - Misguidance on book of businesses given to you. Don't expect any of the assets to be given to you are somehow going to help you. Other advisors dump those assets on you and create no revenue for you. - Don't buy into the mantra that ever advisor is there to help you. - Ponzi-esque
hours can be rough to start
A little behind when it comes to technology.
HR department failed to screen properly against unethical financial advisors, and ignored prima facie evidence, drawn from their own system records, of longstanding abuse amounting to constructive dismissal.
Was told it was drinking from a fire hose when first started (during Covid - no training with another person). This is very true! A lot depends on the Financial Advisor you work with. If you cannot do the job, they will fight you tooth and nail on paying unemployment benefits.
-Outdated Account Options and IT -No Discretionary Authority
Not too much room for promotions
In some areas, pay isn’t keeping up with competitors.
Every office is different if you are not working on the home office.
None at the present time
Antiquated technology, old-fashioned command and control leadership, a ridiculous amount of divisions and specializations, and over-reliance on offshore vendor outsourcing. Pay and PTO are terrible.
Continued support from colleagues in the field can drop off. The trainers are working their offices so they don't always have time to lend a hand.
Pay as an internal candidate is terrible with the industry
No cons at this point
Kind of behind the times, technology wise.
I cannot think of any.
Lack of Career growth development
No promotions available for lower branch level BOAs. It all depends on the FA regardless of your years of service or FA turnover; branch contributions or growth (new clients) to the branch. This greatly impacts pay opportunities and bonuses even though BOA and Sr BOA essential daily job functions / responsibilities are similarly situated. I have Sr BOAs calling me for answers.

Systems are antiquated Poor training on using systems Culture feels inauthentic
High stress, not much autonomy over schedule, lots of operational like tasks needing immediate attention and call center type environment with financial advisors calling, clients calling and expecting to put up with disrespectful clients and financial advisors. If you cannot handle fast paced and ignorant people do not go to this firm.
Needs more room for advancement
Insurance is a little expensive for veteran FAs.
It is up to the financial advisor to compensate well for bonuses and to grow the branch. Home office will listen to all employee concerns but will 100% side with financial advisor.
Horrible hourly pay, benefits and technology
Very independent. Lacks initial structure
High expectations for work requirements
none that can think of
They are not trustworthy. They string you along and make false claims.
Edward Jones preaches that the branches are teams, the only one that is ever considered is the FA. Retaliation for any reason is a serious concern and BOA careers are at the mercy of everyone else but themselves.
Continued support from colleagues in the field can drop off. The trainers are working their offices so they don't always have time to lend a hand.
Not much guidance in what you actually need to do. At the end of the day its a sales position in which you need to grind and hopefully get your family to invest in you to have you hit your marks. All they really focused on was how to door knock. I get PTSD on how much this job was absolutely horrible.

I work with a great team and the company creates opportunities for employees to develop and advance their careers.
I had a great time during my internship at AbbVie, I learned a lot and the people I've met have been foundational to the advancement of my career. I genuinely enjoy the company culture.
In IT, the teams are pretty close knit and good to work with. Almost anyone in IT will jump in to answer questions, help if they can or point you in the right direction. Work life balance is good, Summer Fridays are half-days for US FT teams. Upper management is iffy depending on who you report to. Sales teams have top priority in everything and they will not listen to your concerns. R&D and manufacturing are great to work with and follow best practices. We need a permanent CISO, but leadership is dragging their feet. Overall good place to to work from our perspective.

Unfortunately new hires no longer get enrolled in the pension. The culture is very diverse friendly, and they treat their workers with the utmost respect.

Maternity leave is pretty good compared to some other companies.
good company, learn new knowledge, good pay in pharmaceutical
Great co-workers and the job is almost the same every day.
","There is a lot of deadlines and workload
Support from leadership or the lack thereof is disappointing. One-on-ones with supervisors are often rescheduled and cut short without allotted time for agents to request help or submit feedback during these meetings. There is very little interest from leadership in this department to ""build bridges"" or improve consumer products on a wider scale to stand out among our competition. CSR 1 agents are stuck on a hamster wheel that leads to nowhere. We are treated like robots that are expected to meet unrealistic metrics with little work-life balance. The company has tried to boost culture by supplying food for the few people who still go into the office on a certain day. (In my opinion, this does not improve the root beliefs of agents or how we are treated). Overall there have been many disconnects since the acquisition and personally, I miss Allergan.
Many people start as contractors and during that time you have no paid time off and it can often take years to be hired on. Overtime is not usually mandatory but is kind of expected if you are trying to be hired on to the company.
The culture is super toxic. There is a seniority policy in place so if you have been there since day one (ten years) or came from Abbott and have a senior director title you are untouchable. Managers break chain of command and go to senior directors that you don’t even report to to complain about you bc they know them. There’s this need to feel like you have to be perfect all the time and you can’t make a mistake and if you do make a mistake then they use that company, heart principles to blackmail you and prove why you’re a bad person, the ethics hotline is totally fake when I said some thing to my boss about how I had been in meetings with the vice president and they told us to speak up she said that’s not real, it’s just something they say.
Typical of a large company, Abbvie can be slow to make decisions. It's not terrible, just typical.
Far commute from downtown, but manageable.
Many divisions are Silos, so you have to go up and across and down to get anything done. There needs to be more centralized leadership that can solve problems across these silos. Some upper managers are downright unhelpful. Company wide communications need to improve - many projects lag or go beyond scope because IT is sometimes the last to know.
Required to be in the office and isn't located in the city.
Not a lot of on the job training
It’s about who you know Great place. Just don’t get stuck in one area and get to know people
Monotonous work Clicky management Slow growth
Not in their headcount but signed via a third party
Incompetence at its finest in the fermentation maintenance group. Brand new management thinks that hiring another project manager is going to fix its problems let alone that project manager is Incompetent at his job. They let go their entire hvac group of seniors who specialized in critical equipment. Project manager supposedly has experience in hvac but farms out the work. Management is just looking for a gopher to step and fetch for this project manager because he is lazy and old and doesn't want to do anything hvac related. They want to screw your pay and dump more responsibilities on you. All that's left is the retirees that are waiting on there final day. Place is shutting down buildings and big projects are next to none if you aren't in the construction division.
I dont have any negative comments
Large enterprise, some outdated manual processes and centralized decision making.
Large teams and many layers of management
I think it’s a great company
Old school mentality and not willing to budge. Higher ups stick around forever and they promote people who think like them so nothing changes in the culture. Took tons of people to quit for them to implement work from home offers.
Program is fairly new and structure needs to be validated further
Expected to work over and beyond your means for very little reward. Have very little female or diverse management team. Mainly white men in leadership roles. EEDI campaign is a joke.
Constant meetings, overtime, team building workshops.

Program is fairly new and structure needs to be validated further
Having worked for a variety of large pharmaceutical companies over many years, Abbvie takes governance and micro-management to new levels. Every project no matter how big or small has to be run through multiple governance committees before gaining approval. My efficiency and ability to complete projects has halved compared to what I was doing in my previous company as a result. Ultimately, it seems to come down to the fact that Abbvie doesn't value the skills and capabilities of the teams they employ. Note, i'm not suggesting no governance but rather streamlined to ensure work gets completed; at Abbvie I have taken 6 months to gain approval for a similar project to one I was empowered to approve in my previous role.
Not much opportunities for growth and increase in pay
Only some people can work remotely So many poor managers there with no people skills, micro-managing, treating people like naughty children, there is only 1 way to do things or say things...THEIR way! Demoralizing and demotivating!

If your work ethic is to follow Metrological standard's and be an agent for change, this place is not for you. I tried for 3 years and 10 months. I didn't leave because I was shown the door I left of my own volition.

Not much opportunities for growth and increase in pay
High compliance and getting micromanaging
Leadership needs to provide more direction for company.
Sometimes the challenges to move up beyond middle manager can become tough. There are few opportunities if you are not able to relocate to Chicago.
Need more organized structure and work life balance
This place is a shitshow when it comes to decision making and management. Every single person in management has strictly received their position based on nepotism and tenure. Managers are grossly underqualified compared to their industry standard position - with no experience in their respective departments, no educational background and no certifications. This leads to an inability to drive the site effectively on production, projects, and timelines. Site head is beyond incompetent. Work from home was taken away for no reason. Favoritism runs rampant. Sexual harassment is next level to the point of HR dismissing cases and sweeping reportings under the rug. Offenders have been given promotions as protection. At the bare minimum nobody cares about your well being on a human level. HR is the root of the problem.
Sometimes they would over-do it with the team building and DEI activities.
Typical corporate anxieties that are associated with regular turnover at the management level. The pay is also well below the industry standard. Workload depends on product line, but is generally quite high, especially with regular staffing issues. They operate on a hybrid system, with employees allowed to work from home only 2 days per week.
Can feel a big clique-ish at times
Stressful position Underpaid Job transparency
There are no cons from my experience but depending on team may have issues with vertical growth due to low turnover

Violations Summary: (Elements of each as they relate to the Metrology program at AbbVie) Pharmaceuticals 21 CFR 211 Biologics 21 CFR 606 Medical Devices 21 CFR 820 Human Tissues 21 CFR 1271 Advice to potential Metrology candidate: The Global Metrology Group is highly resistive to change due to legacy Abbott employees and weak Management. If your work ethic is to follow Metrological standard's and be an agent for change, this place is not for you. I tried for 3 years and 10 months. I didn't leave because I was shown the door I left of my own volition.
I would like to see a little more push for modernization of work-life balance with more remote opportunities and flexibility for employees with significantly longer commutes to the various locations as many other companies conduct business with multiple organizations like AbbVie where some employees are required for regular 5 days/week onsite production because of their role and others that are not required of this based on their role within the company.
Nothing specific. Plan career goals carefully to achieve them.
This company is too large.
Company outlook products losing patent
Lack of appreciation for high performers. Lack of equal salary and more work for people that give results
Need more organized structure and work life balance
Sometimes they would over-do it with the team building and DEI activities.
Typical corporate anxieties that are associated with regular turnover at the management level. The pay is also well below the industry standard. Workload depends on product line, but is generally quite high, especially with regular staffing issues. They operate on a hybrid system, with employees allowed to work from home only 2 days per week.
Can feel a big clique-ish at times
PTO could be better - 3 weeks for the first 5 years.
Favoritism resulting into promoting employees
Too much change in Management. Hires friends not that qualifies or others over others much more qualified just because they seems nice, Then later find out they didnt fit at all. I knew someone who created and build a whole entire successful sales team when it was Allergan and they turned them down for someone way less qualified and no experience.
There are no cons from my experience but depending on team may have issues with vertical growth due to low turnover
company is not organized when it comes to hiring
Not a lot of opportunty
Too much variability in territory sales data which negatively impacts commissions
objective keep changing, some senior management are not capable
You still have to deal with the seasonal weather
Eedi is not monitored there.
SAP COE team has a low morale, high turnover and only way to survive is if you are on a H1B visa. Managers promote from a close circle. Avoid at all cost.
None on a personal level
The level of complexity causes unnecessary work and layers of bureaucracy. Work: life balance is discussed and encouraged a lot, however the expectations are very high and with even simple tasks being made difficult it’s tough to feel the sincerity. Everyone appears to be burned out.
There are none that i can think of.
less growth opportunities in higher management
Too many processes, culture of hierarchy and micromanagement
The commute to the Cambridge location is challenging and housing prices nearby preclude a short commute.
None at present, perhaps in future
Lots of collaboration across multiple areas.
More flexibility for COOP roles.
None, location is inconvenient for me
Lots of mandatory trainings that exists to protect Abbvie from any legal implications. Some departments feel as if they have larger impact than others. Can be difficult to network when everyone feels silo'd off but company-wide events do exist and it's up to you to socialize.
not a lot of room for growth. very minimal pay increases. compliance is insane.
Poor management Hiring is based on people you know instead of competency No company culture Stringent on R&D Dysfunctional, unequipped, old labs No diversity and inclusion Upper management mostly men Low bonus and stocks
objective keep changing, some senior management are not capable
Management does not know how to perform basic operator work. Old management, do not like new ideas.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sprouts-Farmers-Market-Reviews-E134467.htm,"Solid communication between management and workers. Team member appreciate weeks every 3-4 months. Clean work environment. Willingness to meet your needs when it comes to work/life balance (if you are a parent, have another job, or are going to school they will make sure to schedule you only when you are available).
The company used to prioritize its customers first and employees second and was a wonderful place to work and shop. It's almost impossible to get fired as a non-management employee.

Some of the best things about working for Sprouts are that the company seems to be more ethical than most other corporations as far as how they aim to take care of the environment, reduce food waste, and strive to be inclusive of all different types of diets and lifestyles. Some weeks there are a lot of hours offered as well. The work environment is overall positive and everyone is usually respectful towards one another.
Nice environment, location, and employees
Great employees and benefits. Free food
This place seems to have all of their ducks in a row! I have been impressed with the level of genuine enthusiasm, not just in regard to their relationships with their client base, but with the incredible work culture they have created with the employees here. everyone here is smiling and enthusiastic, which brims over the top and provides an incredible shopping exp. for the customer as well.
Easy tasks and standard expectations
Worked good hours with awesome people
This company actively looks, hires, and trains college graduates into the Assistant Store Manager role, a rare find these days. The compensation offered is actually competitive, and the corporate team is both kind and active to easing new hires into their role. They'll make sure you understand the many skills needed to survive retail management.
Easy to move up in the company
Learning new products. Vegan products.
-flexible -works with schedule -time off
Fairly easy to move up due to turnover, though raises are a fixed 10% pay bump for promotions. Workload isn't generally too bad when adequately staffed, but rarely is so often doing multiple jobs at once. Fairly decent benefits if full time. Customer base is relatively friendly compared to other retail jobs.
The pros about here are the team
Laidback Easy Flexible Schedule Discounts Nice Uniform
> Culture /can/ be decent, depending on your team and management > Flexible scheduling, positions for students, summer hires and temps usually available > Some room for advancement depending on department, current staffing and available positions; being open to cross training will be most helpful in securing hours, shifts, experience and exposure. > Team member appreciation celebrations, Team member of the month recognitions and prizes > Comfortable and simple uniforms include t-shirts, hoodies and sweaters, beanies and caps and more; basic shoe requirements for outer departments, piecings, non-offensive tattoos and colored hair are all allowed > Pay day is WEEKLY and on Fridays! (Some of us get early pay as early as Wednesday)
Most co-workers were nice and the atmosphere was good.
I really like the company and what it stands for. The company seems to be headed in a good direction.

Nothing positive except 15% discount.
I have learned a lot within working here as a vitamin clerk. There’s a lot of free vendor training for us to understand more about health and also recommend their products. There’s an annual evaluation where you get a $0.10 raise which I guess is better than nothing. Every quarter they have a team member appreciation week where we have a 20% discount rather than 15% and you can win prizes.
Other employees are fun and helpful! Team Member discount on food and flexible schedule for family and school.

It gives good pay, thankfully
They hired new management that was doing a lot of good things.
They were extremely nice and the environment was great to work in. Even when having an accident they paid for it like nothing happened.
Always have job openings posted.
Good culture, expects hardwork but respects their employees and offers fair compensation
","Every once in a while you have to deal with rude customers.
After a change in executive management, the company shifted to cutting hours so each department would usually only have one person staffed at a time. Now often entire departments are unstaffed for shifts at a time despite having plenty of employees in the department wanting to work. Management expects the few working to help cover the unstaffed or understaffed departments, leaving their own department to fall apart. Corporate and regional management believes in absurd pseudoscience that leads to products spoiling faster than they should. I was asked by a regional manager to use unsafe chemicals near food. Both customers and employees are only valued with empty words. Regional and corporate management consistently protects sexually, physically and emotionally abusive store managers. They recently went through and fired waves of managers who care about customers and employees and and at their next investors meeting cited concerns about losing key management. Despite still having investors vote, there is nothing to vote on. The votes are all set up so you can only vote for what the executives want or not vote. This is a normal thing corrupt companies do, but it is still corrupt.
Disconnect between corporate and regions Under staffed
Due to understaffing, the store's rush hours would be long and stressful. I tried to return during a break between semesters and never got my questions returned.
The follow-through on the corporate level for the ideals and plans, they switch at the drop of a hat. If you are looking for more stable hours look for one of the busier locations.
I worked here for over a year and it is blatantly obvious from the 3 month mark that none of the managers have any idea what their doing. The managers try to intimidate and push unrealistic goals onto employees even if it is not their job. And god forbid you come forward with any disagreement with your work environment. Not only will they attempt to make you believe that any unhappiness with the company is your fault, not only will not even take it into any type of consideration, not only will they condescendingly talk down to you, but they will gossip about you endlessly. The moment you cross any manager from any department they will make sure that you’re life there is terrible.
Lack of organization, lack of care from employees but this is all location based so you could possibly get a better situation
Lots of waste. Often received the wrong product or it was too early. Did not adhere to the organic/conventional standards of separation.
- hard to work on feet for so many hours at a time
Can get very busy during some times
Due to understaffing, the store's rush hours would be long and stressful. I tried to return during a break between semesters and never got my questions returned.
Managers do not care what you have to say, you can voice your concerns all you want and be met with a shrug or laugh off. This place has made me depressed to the point of thinking I made a mistake with my life. I absolutely do not recommend this place at all. Raises are worse than mediocre. They always have no hours even as an assistant department manager. They give no training and throw you in as soon as they need help. They love to leave people alone in departments and wonder why their turnover rate is so high. Please for the love of god do not work here.
The follow-through on the corporate level for the ideals and plans, they switch at the drop of a hat. If you are looking for more stable hours look for one of the busier locations.
Messy management, workers weren't held accountable for anything, doing work in 3 different departments but getting paid unfairly and significantly less than others in same position while having more experience and better performance.
Difficult scheduling, horrible management, horrible corporate, drama drama drama
Lack of organization, lack of care from employees but this is all location based so you could possibly get a better situation
Dont not pay you for what you're worth. Their pay raises are pathetic, they might as well just spit in your face. No room for career advancement. Used to be able to move up quickly 10 yrs ago but company now is very corporate and only care about profits and not the workers.
Toxic management. No constructive feedback
Repetitive, management is hit or miss
Lots of waste. Often received the wrong product or it was too early. Did not adhere to the organic/conventional standards of separation.
- hard to work on feet for so many hours at a time
high turnover rate for all employees and management, pay is at max 40 cents a few times a year, they don't give enough hours so if you want to survive make sure you work a second job, healthcare is expensive and not very good, there is no union, management is pushing sales on us but the profits don't make it to our pockets, typical grocery store management/culture where everyone is depressed to be there
Store Management unfair and show alot of favoritism. Especially with raises, reviews, promotions. Dismissive when you have an idea or have some something extraordinary. Raises are terrible. When hurt on job very dismissive and do not follow up or fix issues. Horrible communication. If youre6not liked my the store manager you'll go nowhere, you're hours will be cut for help in your department and five those hours to favored departments. Your reviews will be terrible. And it's gotten away with by corporate. So basically you cant win even when you go to HR or ethics.
Can get very busy during some times
Inconsistent hours, not great pay
Constantly changing focus and programs that don't stick around. Disorganized and dated technology for inventory management, labeling and signage. No structured training for store leadership Too much work not enough hours
The head managers or corporate headquarters don’t attend to your problems unless it’s in their benefit to
I was thrown on to a cash register at the beginning of my first shift, with out being given any information about the specific register. I had previous cash handling experience, but I didn't know how to operate the specific register so in an attempt to have me shorten the long line it grew.
Management and customers were not easy to get along with.
Helped open the new store, once things slowed down I got like 5 hours a week
Store Management doesn't help out team
Dont not pay you for what you're worth. Their pay raises are pathetic, they might as well just spit in your face. No room for career advancement. Used to be able to move up quickly 10 yrs ago but company now is very corporate and only care about profits and not the workers.
The department can get stressful at times due to being understaffed. Additionally work hours can decrease a lot during certain weeks which can be stressful if you have bills to pay. Due to the workload it is often difficult to find time for breaks.
Limited hours per week, so better for students
Toxic management. No constructive feedback
I'm new, and would like to have thorough understanding of the benefits package avail. to me after my initial probational period has ended.
Repetitive, management is hit or miss
When equipment went down, If I.T couldn’t fix issue you had to wait for approval for new
Store and regional managements are exploitive and messy. Stores are run on skeleton crews with less hours each week. HR Business Partners will downplay concerns. The role is salary exempt, meaning that by law your role is supposed to manage, but in reality you'll be thrown to work whatever department is short staffed. ASMs joke about being the ""highest paid cashiers/clerks in the company"". You'll be working almost always more than 10 hours a day, 5 times a week.
Won’t pay a living wage if you have no experience
Quite physical work for everyone. Jobs could be rotated for cross training and less monotonous daily work. Short staffed. Speed talk, speed talk and more speed talk. People not robots. Infighting within departments and out of departments. No team building, except store to store competitions. Numbers rule, not people. Left to fend for self. Aggressive employees and depressed employees. Everyone complained. Back stabbing culture. Immature management. Corporate coming in often - to do what???
-bad pay -a raise was not even a raise
High Turnover, Constant changes in store management, low pay, pathetic raises, inconsistent and inadequate staffing and scheduling. Corporate is very indecisive on policy, and will often change procedures on a whim, with little to no notice or feedback at the store level. Management often fails to communicate these changes, if they communicate with staff at all. Discount is only 15%, and has not been adjusted given enormous price increases across the board.
The cons about this place is management
Boring Limited Growth Opportunity Low Pay Unstable Hours Boring
< Training can be tiresome, boring and dull on the computer, and on the job training potentially too quick, overwhelming or confusing for new hires. Training may get rushed, incomplete or even forgotten about if store conditions are urgent or available team members are stretched thin or too inexperienced themselves. < Pay is hit or miss. The company follows a calculator when issuing offers that is supposed to take into account the position, your experience and other factors (In my personal experience, my first position here (before this one) I was woefully shafted in my pay offer and when I asked if possible to round up to the nearest dollar, I was met with a ""No."" The job I was applying for I had 4 years of direct previous experience. But being desperate for a job at the time, I reluctantly accepted it. Still, I could've been making more money selling watered down lemonade at that rate.) < Sometimes opportunities and hours slow down, sales dry up during dead months and this is when hours get cut. Like already mentioned, a good way to secure your hours is to be open to helping elsewhere/cross training, gaining basic knowledge in other departments and basically being more useful or willing than others thus becoming more of an asset to management/the store One trick ponies wont always prosper, especially since the company doesn't [strictly] adhere to any ""seniority"" policies.
Pay was low and turnover was very high.
Very few cons that I can think of.
Part-time really means less than 20 hours here
Upper management determining overall daily work while only giving dependable hours for departments. Crazy expectations and huge returns while giving management no room to work with and achieve those goals
Some workers had to over work on behalf of others and there was no diversity in management
Abysmally low raises twice a year. I've seen/heard as low as 12 cents. Communication feels like it often stays behind closed doors of it comes out at all. System upgrades and roll-outs are not very organized and generally feels like 1 step forward, two steps back. The company runs extremely lean labor so if one person misses a shift it causes a lot of problems. Healthcare sucks and is expensive.
Ever changing expectations, lack of communication, drama
Sometimes not enough people put on a shift
Every once in a blue moon, you will get a rude or upset customer.
Pay for your workers, not so good. This place is a revolving door of managers for a reason.
Made promises of moving me to a more secure position, but ended up breaking that promise.
I personally don't have any cons at this time
Limited flexibility for weekly hours
Some odd hours as part time
Managers suck, favoritism is insane. No one works so you pick up slack.
They are a very greedy and exploitative company that views all employees as expendable. The retention rate is so bad that I see new people every time I come in for a shift. Since it’s hard to find people that will stay with the bad pay, the ones that do stay can be incredibly difficult to work with. Just about all of the older men that work here have had many sexual harassment complaints yet nothing is done about it because they can’t find people who can stand it. We are seen as comparable to Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s yet the pay isn’t even close. If you work here longer it feels like you are treated worse.
Rude and insulting managers. Too many untrained managers and not enough workers. I have been in retail grocery 7 years and never been bossed around by so many managers at one time, sometimes the managers not agreeing with each other.
Store manager had favorites Store manager will give you a hard time if they’re in a bad mood
I'm new, and would like to have thorough understanding of the benefits package avail. to me after my initial probational period has ended.
Not enough hours at least for those needing those hours honestly or not straightforward about how full-time and part-time works
Upper management rarely supports subordinates
When equipment went down, If I.T couldn’t fix issue you had to wait for approval for new
Won’t pay a living wage if you have no experience
New age retail Algorithm based business functions Culture of high performance Lack of inventory control
None really, I enjoyed my time there.
Upper management determining overall daily work while only giving dependable hours for departments. Crazy expectations and huge returns while giving management no room to work with and achieve those goals
Pay very little compared to many other grocery stores
Open 364 days a year. Only day closed is Christmas.
Sometimes the people you come into contact with cannot be the most pleasant
Lack of training Semi-heavy workload Very strict policies
Nothing bad to say at all
Sometimes the ratio of customers to cashiers is overwhelming without help of a courtesy clerk. Usually cashiers do their own bagging.
store management can be incompetent
Pay scale seems to be the low end of low.
Bad management with everything and anything
none to mention at the moment
If you go against even the smallest thing, they will try to cut you out entirely

Lazynindividuals that suffer no repercussions, apparently workers have to prove they are entitled to 40 hours. But that's the excuse that managers use to make you do 20 hours of work but schedule you for 10 hours and expect you throw out your back overworking to make up for the loss of useless coworkers/ bosses. While my boss had the cushiest work hours, while somehow working none of the understaffed, load days.
- Lack of employees at certain locations in certain departments - Not enough hours or overtime given for the work that needs to be done with the lack of employees at certain locations - Lack of work accountability! when others on the team are purposely failing/not completing task the way they should be done, they should be held accountable for it! Not having the other/hard workers trail behind them and fix everything thats done wrong…
Limited flexibility for weekly hours
This is coming from personal experience, and I don’t know if it’s the same at other stores. I’m a closer at my location, and frankly I think closing grocery clerks have too much to do. We have 1 closer every night. We have 3 departments to work in (Dairy, Frozen & Grocery) I heard we used to have 2 grocery closers & 1 dairy closer that would also cover frozen, but they stopped doing that, to which I don’t know why. Most nights for me are quite stressful, because I’ve got so much to do in such little time. I’ve asked for help but the help I’ve gotten wasn’t really helpful…
Some odd hours as part time
There aren't any, if you are coming from a long career in another life.
Unprofessional, Unreliable, Unaccountable, Irresponsible, Disrespectful Totally lacking in values, honor, and integrity. Just pathetic! Extremely High Turnover! Need I say more? Disclaimer. This review is how I would sum up my entire experience over 2 years time with all of management, as a whole. It is not based off of one incident or one person. This is not retaliatory. I was not fired. I left willingly, on my own accord.
Little hours is not so nice
Older managers need a lot of training to be better at their jobs. They would schedule closing/opening shifts even after the company said they would stop. They practice a lot of favoritism and bully 'bad employees', who were really just young people figuring out the workforce. Not a great place to work when all you're getting is minimum wage.
TERRIBLE hours, i went from getting 20-30 a week down to 4-12. They seem to be doing the hting where many companies are just hiring waves of part time employees.
Out-of-touch sales tactics & lean staffing Wide pay gap discrepancies within the same job description. Labor laws are definitely a suggestion and not hard & fast rules. Will keep your PTO when you quit. Won’t fire you to dodge unemployment claims. Turnover rate is HIGH for a reason.
Can sometimes rush to decisions which leads to rework later Benefits could be stronger and more competitive

Since joining Boston Scientific over two years ago as a data scientist, I've been continually pleasantly surprised by the culture: at every turn my ideas are heard; innovation is encouraged, appreciated, and supported; employees can bring their full selves; and the sense and presence of community is real. I'm truly excited for this company's future, and for my career at Boston Scientific.
The company's culture focuses on getting things done for the company and our patients as a whole rather than individuals and functions. If you want make a large impact while working collaboratively this is the place to be.

My managers/supervisors have always been supportive of BSC. My co-workers are hard-working, but very few work more than 40-45 hours a week. We are encouraged to take PTO and do not need to take PTO to attend doctor's appointments for ourselves or dependents. The training is intense but amazingly helpful. HR issues are nearly non-existent in my department - my co-workers care about each other and are team-oriented and supportive. The benefits are vast and there are a lot of options. Maven is a huge win for family-oriented employees with support during reproductive years, adoption, surrogacy, breastfeeding, etc. BSC supports their employees so they can do their best work and lead their best home-lives.

Maven is a huge win for family-oriented employees with support during reproductive years, adoption, surrogacy, breastfeeding, etc. BSC supports their employees so they can do their best work and lead their best home-lives.

I have worked for several large and small medical device companies throughout my career and I have found that Boston Scientific is the one which curates it’s culture to be the most positive experience for its employees. Without forcing diversity, the company is diverse. Without forcing work-life balance, the company enables work-life balance. 5/5 stars.

","I'm sure there are some I can think of, but I believe the pros outweigh whatever cons there are.
culture varies by business unit although leadership is strong, managers aren't always best suited to manage
Boston Scientific is large company, and change can be slow. In addition, this size and the general structure that has resulted from growth through acquisitions means that silos can abound. It takes a willingness to reach out to others, effort to spread ideas, and engagement of the rich communities of practice and employee resource groups to drive important change. Fortunately, the company culture is such that when you do this, you will be heard, and you will be empowered to continue.
Some portions of the organization (like supply chain) are heavily matrixed and that makes decision making slower that smaller companies and you have work towards building consensus.
Common pressures in manufacturing environment, being asked to do more with less, culture feels inconsistent or not well developed at acquisition sites even several years after
surrounding towns don't have fun things to do
Sometimes hard to find people with expertise in a specific area because the company is big
Seems to be pushing too much to fit in with the culture
In certain positions and areas salaries and not the hughest
It may take a while to get co-op projects off the ground.

-Very vague job -A TON of travel and driving
Not too many conversations on room for growth.
promotions can be hard to get, merit raises tend to be small.
There aren’t really any cons.
-Time to learn company processes
I do not have any cons
Not as large a portfolio as its two American competitors. This can lead to losing hospital/system contracts b/c MDT/ABT have more 'silos' and may offer incentives.
Challenging to work towards and obtain a promotion without changing groups, though this is likely true anywhere
Need to improve the employee compensation programs, especially when it relates to rewarding long serving employees.
No cons that I can think of
Pay is not that competitive compared to workload
not that I see. It is a good company.
Takes time to make great money but their current portfolio is great with a solid pipeline.
I wish I lived a bit closer to work.

If you are not used to fast paced work this may not be a company for you, as we certainly have the work hard play hard mentality.
Not much opportunity for career advancement once you are past entry level. You are on your own for skills development. Engineers are treated as interchangeable, frequently moved between projects based on whatever management is panicking about at the moment. High turnover among top performers. Mediocre engineers stay forever. Overwhelming amount of bureaucracy, even by the standards of a large medical device company. Ten people creating documents for every one engineer. Management is clueless why everything takes so long and costs so much. Managements' answer to any problem is to create another layer of bureaucracy. No leadership from division management, they seem happy to coast along. Management decisions take forever, sometimes missing the opportunity. Upper management is only motivated by money, no matter what they claim about patients, customers or employees. Management shipped all Neuromod manufacturing work to Ireland and Costa Rica. Moving more and more engineering to same places. Great for Ireland and Costa Rica, not so great for U.S. Upper management is very self-congratulatory about how supportive they are of women, minorities, etc. However, it is just lip-service. For example, departments are highly segregated by sex: engineers are all men, HR and marketing mostly women. Top management all white men.
Need to improve the employee compensation programs, especially when it relates to rewarding long serving employees.
No cons that I can think of
not that I see. It is a good company.
very high turnover. Some folks in management positions were clueless in what/how their teams functioned
Less paying Parking lot Building carries Less opportunity Hard to upgrade
Takes time to make great money but their current portfolio is great with a solid pipeline.
Would like more stability and better communication
I wish I lived a bit closer to work.
lacks diversity in engineers and the surrounding area in general
Upper management seems to believe in a ""more with less"" approach to engineering
If you are not used to fast paced work this may not be a company for you, as we certainly have the work hard play hard mentality.
Power towers & fiefdoms exist in all companies-just something to be aware of as sometimes cliques can be college based-so if you are not from MN, something to consider. Also, review their web page on Diversity hiring and Women in leadership. It is very bold and essentially states who is not being hired and advanced. What does this say towards older tenured workers? While these are good, it excludes others based upon their identity. Even more sadly, is this page does not even acknowledge those with disabilities? healthcare disabilities? Is this virtue signaling when a healthcare company cannot acknowledge healthcare diversity? This is sad for a company that I still love to this day.
Misalignment with personal values and leadership in certain areas are ineffective and unsupportive. Manage to create a negative work environment.
Production Cafeteria is still small consider for a big company with many employees.
The only downside i see is that it’s a little difficult to switch from a non-manager position to transition to management because they will want to see that you have some type of experience at it.
Old company/government dynamics, lots of money and ideas thrown at projects and dropped just as fast. Slow to update tech at the non product level
Doesn’t pay as much as competitors in the same field.
Salary isn't competitive with competitors, lack of admin days, health insurance isn't the best.
The company does not translate diversity, equity, and inclusion into its practices on the team level. The company needs to train its managers on how to support neurodivergent employees. This company pushes people hard which is a recipe for burnout. Everyone is stressed out and not happy.
Work as temp worker for months to a year before receiving any real benefits before getting hired on. pay isn't much.
there's a good amount of turnover
Large company with complex systems to navigate
Big company so harder to navigate. Minimal cons though
Salary is below standard rates
Pay isn't competitive compared to same job at other companies.
A little slow at times
If you are thinking about working for the site in Alpharetta, Georgia, maybe reconsider. You are not treated with respect there unless you are Senior or higher. They expect you to understand how the processes work and don’t bother providing informational training and when you ask for help, you are met with condescension. The environment is also very high pressure and stressful. Management acts like they are here to support you, but it is all performative. When I expressed feeling overwhelmed, my manager said “All of your counterparts have more work than you and they aren’t complaining.” Come to find out, I am not the only engineer she said that to. When a quality tech and I compared our salaries, I was only making a couple thousand more than her yearly. Mind you, I am a quality engineer with an engineering degree. A quality tech position does not even require a degree so why would we be within the same pay range? Additionally, when they advertised the job opening to replace me, the salary advertised was about 15K more than what I was being paid. Also, this site doesn’t have much room for growth AT ALL as far as exploring other functions and opportunities. Lastly, the worst part is you will constantly be watching toxic people with multiple HR complaints against them being promoted and not properly dealt with which let’s me know that this company is comfortable with the toxic work environment that they have created.
My opinion is not based on something bad that had happened. I had a great performance review and no conflict of any sort, so what I am about to say is an honest opinion, free of bias. Boston Scientific was a medical devices company that I wanted to work for based on similarity of reviews compared to another fantastic med-tech company I worked for. I was extremely disappointed with what I encountered. Layers and layers of bureaucracy and red tape ... most of it self-inflicted. As an engineer, expect to spend 80-95% of your time in meetings and filling out no value-add quality system paperwork. Company growth is driven by acquisitions and existing product portfolio, not internal R&D or new product development. If you are expecting to develop professionally as an engineer, this is not a place for you. Very slow, process and paperwork driven environment. Paperwork comes with being a medical device company, but Boston Scientific is miles ahead of competitors in terms of self-inflicted over kill. Quality Managers/Engineers provide the least value to the company but drive 100% of the decision making. Again, one of the biggest disappointments in my career, after working hard to get into the company. The company almost embraced the woke culture ... you nearly have to commit felony crime here to get fired. Incompetence runs deeps with people who should have been fired a long ago maintaining high pay jobs while offering nothing in return. If you don't believe me, compare similar companies' revenue growth over the past 10 years, with BSCI. In my short time with BSCI we had almost 70% engineering turn-over rate within the group.
as an older company tough to offer incentives

The cardiology group is growing and changing at a fast pace right now and I am very worried that the culture I speak so highly about might change with this new growth. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t.

Being a global company meant you tended to remain with your group alone. There were things you may NEED to learn and didn't always have time to learn them.
Not competitive pay at the moment

Should never have left BSC. Should have stayed there.

no cons. Its a great company to work for.
In my experience, this organization has significant issues with management characterized by dishonesty, rudeness, and an intimidating atmosphere. There is a noticeable division between departments, leading to a lack of collaboration. High turnover rates, broken communication, inadequate compensation, and a resistance to feedback further hinder growth and employee satisfaction.
Slow growth and European mindset
Don't really have any cons
To much travel for service engineers
Low Pay for beginners can be increased
On call 24-7 but overtime pay is nice. Can be high pressure when a customer is waiting on emergency repairs to be completed.
ABB has acquired various drives units from prior competitors. In my case, this meant the structure of the unit was still the same grumpy guys counting down until retirement, making sexist jokes, and using sometimes subpar safety protocols. While corporate-led training was indicated as required for me to perform some roles, local management refused to send me for this training. My unit also understated the travel required for the position. Higher management was changing every other week, so this unit had minimal oversight.
cons I can't say yet
Update technology and upgrade machinery,
Global company means global restrictions
Can be somewhat unstructured at times.
Sometimes there are part shortages.
Still working in organizing to be effective in the American market
The company is big and slow. They have had a hard time innovating and maintaining a leadership position in some divisions
Prefer working closer with the manufacturing plants.

Long ot hard to move up
Very corporate infrastructure. Company can make simple tasks difficult due to bureaucracy.
There are some understaffed departments adding additional work items to other groupa.
Only 1 week of vacation for the 1st 3 yrs.

Nothing but the best, but it's a good work

Low pay. Production lines aren’t the best depending on the plant.
No cons in my opinion
Lots of organizational changes which always impacts the strategy
Work / Life balance can be challenging at times based on demands of the business.
Work way too many Saturdays
Normal struggles common to working under a large company.
Too much traveling at times
Too many management hurdles to jump over to get things done.
Lots of overtime . .
Low pay for skilled labor. Poor communications at all levels. Very eurocentric
Management is lacking. Do not do what they say they will do.
Never knew what you would be doing each day
Large company bureaucracy struggles are to be expected.
too many changes for a short period of time. my job was made redundant and sent to Mexico right before the holidays and we were informed in November. I had to train my replacements which was twisting the knife the already stuck in you.
The company is so large and complex, that it is often difficult to see a clear career path.
Work- life balance and travel.
Back stabbing and hostile management
Org Structure, career opportunities take time
I do not think any.
No cons, only pros. Great location and opportunities
Lake of clear long term strategy Frequent change in management
location of the plant older machinery, needs updating
Travel a lot and hard culture
It's Assembly work. It can get boring doing the same thing all day long.
Most people here are lazy
ABB needs to have better opportunities for advancement.
Did not value the long term skill set and investment of Iowa employees.
They are understaffed and over worked
The drive from my house
Toxic working environment Bad career development Worst leadshership forever
Frequent turnover rate - Upper Management
Such a large company not all communication is clear but this has little to no impact on the role.
TOO BIG, your contribution is not always visible
Large corporation can be difficult to know where to go for help.
The salaries need to be more competitive
Baldor gets less vacation, holidays, bonuses, benefits than ABB even though they call it ABB. Management is the worst I’ve ever seen. You are basically waiting for your turn to get fired. I’ve seen people that work there for 10, 20, even 40+ years get targeted and fired because management didn’t like them (for no reason). Management has the buddy system and if you’re not in the group for the current management, you’re screwed. They will even prove you are replaceable by firing or running off key people with all the knowledge. If they want you gone, they will overload you with work until you fail so they can fire you. Expect to be disrespected, insult, etc, often in a joking way. Expect to never be good enough or appreciated. Expect to be overworked. Expect to always feel you have zero job security. Watched them hide cameras just to catch someone they want to fire (hourly and salary). Salary never gets as good of a raise as hourly’s cost of living raise. And that should be the minimum!!! Only way you’re getting a raise in salary is if you are liked and if you are not liked or disliked, expect little or no raise (0.25-1% per yr). No matter how much you do, it is never enough and you will never be appreciated. You will eventually work 2-3 times as much and still won’t be enough. Expect to work a lot of free overtime and weekends. Due to overtime, the average hourly worker makes much more and even double their boss’s salary pay. They shouldn’t do this!!! Engineering/maintenance manager is an idiot and causes more damage, downtime and cost than anyone in the plant, maybe company. I don’t understand how he keeps his job, oh yes, the buddy system! Engineers and maintenance often leave because they can’t work for him. He messes up things so bad and cost the company so much money because he won’t listen to his employees that know what the correct solution is. Sometimes if you repeat it enough, he will have an idea and parrot back to you what you have been trying to tell him while insulting you. He will call his engineers at all hours of the night including weekends. He will ask them to do other work and put aside their projects only to later get on to them for not having the project done on time. As an engineer, you will never work less than 50hr per week and often much more with zero compensation. PDAs are a joke (performance review). You are judged by the whole plants performance, not yours. You are giving projects to complete but during the year pulled to other goals and penalizes for not completing them. Expect to always be graded as average or below average! Nothing feels better than to work extremely hard all year and be told you suck, you’re replaceable, you’re getting a fraction of the raise hourly employees got and if you work extra hard (carrot) maybe next year! Knowing you could be the next one targeted (fired) leaves you stressed and worried about your finances (mortgage, car payment, bills). Only way you’re getting promoted is if you’re in the buddy system. FYI- your first few years is the honeymoon phase but give it a few years and you start to get treated like the rest. Honestly I’m not sure how the company hasn’t gone bankrupt yet? Extremely wasteful with money, overpriced motors, and rundown old machines to try to keep production running. I expect less and less market share in the future. And I won’t even go into the massive overload of stress! Do yourself a favor and just don’t apply! Everyone that leaves (fired or quits) is always so much happier in their new job at a different company! Just say NO!
there were no cons for me
Very little support, Eng. team is in India which makes remote support difficult, NO TRAINING INCLUDED IN JOB
Top heavy, poor communication, poor onboarding, poor implementation of new processes.
Need more diversity in leadership, large company slow at developing new products for rapidly changing markets.
They are understaffed and over worked
Stress, expectation of performance, convoluted and excessive corporate policies, little autonomy, people culture.

Large corporation can be difficult to know where to go for help.
there were no cons for me
Long term employees not well compensated resulting in loss of experienced talent
I have worked here for 1 year. No cons
very hard to advance in company unless you know someone.
Management, Direction, Mandatory overtime, lack of upward mobility.
The rudest secretary I have ever met.
Travel a lot of time
Company does not compensate at the high end of the salary range.
Not thing to offer for Cons
The management structure changes constantly, turnover is high, objectives and goals changes constantly
Typical office politics. “Unlimited” vacation
Corporate slowness, hard to advance

Great work life balance at UF
A lot of fun A lot of good people
- Very good benefits, including state of florida health insurance options and paid parental leave plus other things - In the departments I worked with, in general the vibe was positive
Good people, great work being done.
Great group of TA's and professor to work with
I really enjoyed working at RecSports mainly for the flexible hours. As long as you hit a certain amount of hours a week, you were free to choose your hours, as long as the shift wasn't taken. Even if you don't get a shift you want, you can usually get others to pick it up for you.
Excellent and friendly. Very satisfied.
The management, bosses, co-workers, and people involved within this center are all amazing in their own right. The hours are incredibly flexible and everyone cares about you. If there is ever a discrepancy with scheduling, they will be able to help you out.
Great experience during my time at UF
Awesome WLB, good team members and benefits
Friendly office culture to support employee
My professor is very easy to work with in Engineering, and very respectful of my personal life/needs.
Working with the team was nice and my schedule was flexible.
Great place to develop my career coaching skills. The team is very caring and it’s a great part time job for students.
Periodic cost of living increases, benefits, structured organization, easy to use systems
As a doctoral student: Great opportunity to Learn new research skills in gait analysis, Great experience with data analysis.
the weather is good in winter
Engaging, intelligent and supportive faculty.
There is a great environment.
Tuition waver Healthcare Work-Life Balance
Hours are very flexible Research is fun co workers are great
Great opportunities to move up, love it here
Great place to learn and build your career
Health insurance is definitely why I chose this job. Access to UFs affordable plans gives you several options for insurance carriers and plan levels, with free stuff offered at no cost to the employee. Vacation time is pretty good, almost standard across the board, unless you are an essential employee. But with holiday closures and vacay/ sick approval, it's comfortable. Safe work environment physically, with very close access to hospitals. (not emotionally safe?)
Very supportive environment, allow for interdisciplinary collaboration, strong in research
Great way to earn your PhD and get paid at the same time.
Flexible hours and ability to work by yourself.
UF is one of the best schools in the nation and they treat the staff well.
Health insurance is good if you are Faculty or Staff (TEAMS).
The city is quite cheap.
Access to resources, large Advancement team, room for growth, love my coworkers, state benefits

- Growth opportunities - Professional development - Work with people who are passionate on what they do. - UF has centralized resource service centers (e.g., ICBR, RSC) that provides researchers with the resources they need to conduct cutting-edge research and to promote collaboration and innovation. - Diversity and inclusiveness; we all come from different backgrounds and we all have one goal in mind and that is to drive research at UF forward. - Nice Campus - Good medium size town surrounded by nature; many outdoor activities

Best way to gain experience.
It's a good company to work for. Work culture is laid back.
flexible, understanding, pay well, friendly
Benefits and work life balance
Paid a minimum no matter how much work is done Flexible hours - work on your own schedule mostly
Great job! Management was very well organized and they treated you really well. Easy job, as there wasn’t much to do on the daily. You main do your homework
Good interactions with students. Notebook grading and some teaching in the organic chemistry lab, but nothing that will distract too much from research.
Interesting, informative, challenging, institutional, diverse
perfect for students needing a flexible schedule
colleagues, benefits, raises, culture, management
Good pay, flexible hours for student
Flexible, helpful, and sense of achievement.
wonderful support for conducting research.
Great infrastructure, big university, recognized state wide

Loved working here, as the opportunity to learn new things is abundant. It was a good balance of responsibility yet not too stressful. The company culture was very friendly.
None I can think of.
Working at the frontier of human knowledge is exciting and challenging. UF Scripps has openings at many levels, including tenure-track faculty, postdoctoral research associates and administrative staff. Every day, new job openings are being added to jobs.ufl.edu.

","No parking on campus for students, they would invest in some parking infrastructure
No cons, the office is a little far off from the main university
Low payment for the work
- Pay wasn't the best - Being such a large employer, UF can seem kind of impersonal - Getting a raise implemented took forever even after my supervisor signed off on it
Low pay, research needs constant attention
There are no cons to share
Since you're put with other employees on shift, you're usually left to either interact or sit in silence because sometimes there wasn't much to do.
There are no cons to working here.
It's not a lifelong job, although I desperately wish it was. The hourly wage offered is great for a student getting through college, but not meant for a lifetime.
None - really enjoyed working here
slow workflow can be stagnate
Sometimes, it is result oriented.
So far I have no cons.
You're always inside your office working
Student interactions can be difficult if they’re not enthusiastic about receiving career support from a peer.
Low salaries, salary increases based on performance are rare and difficult, career progression difficult, hiring and promotion biases (good ole boy system), leadership is severely lacking, office politics run high, few hybrid/remote options, cost of parking, imbalanced workload and pay. If you want to put in a lot of work then watch someone with less knowledge, skill, and poor work ethic be promoted instead based on favoritism alone, this is the place for you.
I do not have any downsides.
not paying enough of what the students deserve
Parking options are extremely limited.
The pay is low though.
Pay Does not Meet Cost of Living Inept University Leadership Inept Union Leadership
Extensive research Get ready to get wet and probably covered with concrete Sandy work
HR is very slow with paperwork; can be annoying
doest pay well for graduate students
Parking is expensive and a nightmare. I would guess it's comparable to other college campuses, and cities where you would have to pay to park. But ticketing and towing are excessive and punitive, not to mention not entirely ADA compliant. Depending on your college and department, the workplace can be very toxic emotionally. Wage discrepancies are abundant, and many policies are arbitrarily enforced. Depending on your career trajectory, there may be few career development options or tenure and promotion tracks for staff—only faculty. (MyTraining is only beneficial for UF career paths - useless outside of the University)
Nothing to declare at this time.
Salary is lower compared to industry.
Need to stay on top of your hours
Gainesville can be a tough place to move when you’re used to a bigger city. While location is not the most ideal, it is just an hour to each coast.
For academia: Poor career development (if you move here, you're trapped, UF is the main employer) Low chances of getting a salary increase as staff. Some supervisors are poorly trained (some not trained at all). Supervisors evaluate employees but employees don't get the chance to evaluate supervisors.
Paid for 40 hours a week, but work for 60 hours a week.
Gainesville can be a tough place to move depending on what you're used to, but more remote opportunities are becoming available
Honestly cant think of any
Too much beurocracy and administrative hurtles.
No cons working at UF
none that come to mind
Busy, Teaching Hospital, not every staff is well qualified, low salaries
Can feel overworked at times for what the salary entails. Cost of living is way too high considering the location.
Unequal pay. New incoming employees pay is almost as much as for a long time employee. If you are in the right clique, you get promotions. Dishonest supervisors. Careful of what you are saying. Leadership doesn't acknowledge dedicated workers. Pay is on the low end. Some employees have to go on food stamps or the UF pantry
no that i am aware of
Gainesville can be a tough place to move depending on what you're used to, but more remote opportunities are becoming available
After I worked my way up in the company, my compensation was not representative for how much work I needed to put in. I would get scolded for not completing work, while I was not getting paid and not at work.

This school is highway robbery. Even Graduate Teaching Assistants who WORK for the university have to pay. The worst medical insurance in the country, even for full-time faculty. Their medical insurance does not pay for birth control pills, even if the pills are taken for medical reason. They will try to cheat you out of your money at every opportunity. Every time they want to deny you one of your rights (deduction from your paycheck for insurance, for instance), re-read your contract. They are expert at violating their own contract. You must assume that this university will not respect their own contract. You must question everything, it gets very tiring at the end. If you threaten them through the union, they will back down. They are UNWILLING to spread your paycheck over 12 months. You must save your money during the academic year in order not to starve during the summer. Why? Nobody can explain. For the schedule of classes, they use the stupid ""period system"", that nobody has memorized. Only 2 weeks for winter break. WTF? If you teach online, you have to do it from your classroom (not from home), just in case some students want to attend a face-to-face class! Then, you have the terrible smell, but it is all over the city, not just the campus.

- Low pay when could be compensated much higher in industry for same level of work
Not much room for growth.
Depending on the professor that you are working under, the experience can be good or bad
Budget for hours, high turn over, lack of opportunity to move up, stagnent
Low pay vs market average
Paid maximum of 10 hours per week, no matter how much work done (depends on position)
Can get boring if you don’t have much to do
Pay isn't great, but for getting paid during your graduate school experience, it is fine.
Lots of institutional politics and egos.
unreliable shift days/times, required to work holidays/weekends/overnights/gamedays. Sometimes very few shifts are available.

Amdocs actively seeks out feedback from employees on a regular basis, and from my perspective takes actions to improve where needed as the market and the needs of the employees have evolved along with the market and industry changes. There is a focus on Internal Mobility with learning material and upskilling courses widely available and easily accessible. Although the nature of some roles require presence in an office or data center, we have the option to work remotely and the office has evolved into a gathering space with frequent live events, free lunch twice a week and there is always plenty of free food and drinks in the breakroom. The commitment to growing a diverse and inclusive workforce is clearly communicated to the employees as a priority. Community is created through city events put on by HR where they go all out and the attendance is always high. The unlimited vacation is nice as well!
Flexible schedule, future opportunities are available.

","- Old processes and technologies
I worked for a company that was acquired by Amdocs and then Amdocs-ified. It's just not fun to work for a company in transition like that. Lots of growing pains, low company morale. In addition, the company has been restructuring and reducing its workforce.
No salary raise frequently. Management can do better
- Little to no training. Learn as you go. If you're an introverted person, this may not be a place for you. Be aggressive and ask questions! - Lack of long term directions for career growth. You're thrown into a position and you have to work. - You're not salary, so you have to clock 45 hours a week. - You're a contractor, and some vendors are not helping in your training. - No real structure in how work is assigned (depending on the group). No scrum or anything but that depends on the vendor. - You're exposed to next gen technology but actually don't work on it depending on the group your in. - Unlimited vacation -- yeah there's a catch... You really can't take 2 weeks off, because of the nature of your work. You don't have a true backup like a normal company. - Generally not a good place for kids out of school because of the stress and nature of the work. It's better for an experienced developer. - I've never worked at a place before where they hire so many bad Java Developers and Java is an easy language.
Too much stress. many weekends
Medium low salary range that dose not fit well to a leader in software telecommunication field.
Work-Life-Balance is questionable, while to job itself might be satisfying, the pressure can be overwhelming at times
Salary is average, in line with market. Company hardly gives you any raise. Management is super harsh and unrealistic with deliverable targets. You don't have enough people to work with. Each employee always accumulate multiple hats. Way too many directors, VPs and executives and too less hands on professionals.
The size of teams causes them to get in the way of themselves.
Relatively low salary Overwhelming hours
Pretty much everything you don't like in a company. Persistent lay-offs resulting in low morale, no opportunities for growth and compensation below average.
No work life balance Frequent lay offs
No cons so far. Great company.
Old Technologies, team politices, less pay
Slow in picking up new technologies
- Site location, not my preferred place to be currently living in. - Work can be rather demanding at times.
average compensation ; production support is hectic.
They are working with an old technology
Difficult company to navigate because of the company's scale and its very dynamic nature. Yes, being dynamic can have its perks and downsides too.
bad company dont like working
No salary revisions after 1 year.
There is more Work pressure
low pay, long work hours
Its good overall may have few cons but negligible
Nothing unusually negative to say for a company of this size. They try to keep employees happy and expect results.
Bureaucratic and political at times
Large and complex business structure makes it difficult to navigate through org and understand business model
Unfortunately, you do not have a work life balance
can't really think of any, but as to every workpalce you might find something you don't like.
No bench period even for full time employees in US. If the project gets over, the HR and the manager gives the ultimatum to quit, same day as the project will be over. In the meantime you have to search for projects on your own.
Bureaucratic and political at times
can't really think of any, but as to every workpalce you might find something you don't like.
Unlimited PTO can take some time to get approved. The 401k is on a 5 year vesting schedule and doesn't have a Roth option. These are pretty minor though
Literally everything else? I was hired full time in June, then first thing after New Year's they're having massive layoffs. No warning, just all the plans that were supposedly made just go poof? They cited the ""looming economic crisis"" but give me a break, this company handles subscriptions for every major subscription service you can think of: Netflix, Disney, NFL Sunday ticket, Amazon, all of them. They are swimming in money Scrooge McDuck style and this is how they treat their employees. I don't know if the CEO is just one of those dummies trying to emulate Elon, or if this was all just a money laundering operation, but this was some BS. In conclusion: You probably don't want to work here unless you have to because they'll throw you in the trash at the first opportunity.
Management seems to lack in the communication area between HR and employees. Company reported huge profits in December, promising employees bonuses and job security only to retract that and lay off thousands of its employees at a drop of a hat with a weeks notice in advance.
No directions from manager or management
Long Hours Yearl Lay Offs
- Micromanagement - No work life balance - No salary hike even after 2 years of service - No recognition - No stock options for employees

Tough work. Challenging. Hi Do Do
Not that I know off
None none none none none
if you resign or fired will loose last year of bonus that is not industry standard practice.
Overworked teams with little to no support for interns on some teams unless if you're lucky and get placed in a better team Very inefficient communication and supervisors seem inconvenienced to take time to actually integrate you, no real mentorship going on
nice to work with any time
Not many.Management is more centralized in Israel
focused on providing many services but lowering salary, unlimited vacation is a gimmick
Merged into the bigger AMDOCs and several layoffs.
Chaotic work environment due to too few resources and high turnover, preach work life balance but exec management does not live by these words, not realistic. Communication out of Israel headquarters is lacking. Travel nearly impossible despite heavy global presence has long term impact to progress. Pay scales do not compete with market especially niche and in demand roles.
I feel challenged, supported and fairly compensated by Amdocs so have no complaints.
Many moving parts, lots of restrictions trying to get the job done.
None none none none none
Benefits could be better - very minimal.
Need for documentation No formal training Top management heavy Short staffed No direction on who's doin what when someone leaves
Overworked teams with little to no support for interns on some teams unless if you're lucky and get placed in a better team Very inefficient communication and supervisors seem inconvenienced to take time to actually integrate you, no real mentorship going on
I've been here over 3 years and recognize this can be a demanding environment. You will be challenged, but I feel this is a positive and causes personal growth. Never board and always learning and growing! Not a con really, but also not for everybody!
Some might have difficulty adjusting to the variety of cultural styles (Israel, India, US), but everyone was very professional.
Fiscal conservatism of the company causes them to pay less than other comparable companies.

I can't think of a Con right now!
Nothing specific, all is good.
Paying below market average and low salary increases
Not really I can think of
Management in fiber department could be better
Dirty Politics at management level which affect progression, Bonus and growth. HR and manager not properly follow performance management. Frequent lay off every quarter
Upper Management is very demanding, always low staff, high turn over with employees.
1. Old tools and technologies used
Salary not as competitive and moving up very difficult
Paying below market average and low salary increases

Management in fiber department could be better
1. Old tools and technologies used
Salary not as competitive and moving up very difficult
Won't involve employee in development of the code
No cons to mention about
a bit late in embracing new technologies
long work hours, slow growth for some
1. Policy of ""unlimited vacation"" is a farse. Upper management will never approve the time due to never ending excuse of ""needs of the business"". 2. Primarily being a software company, the lack of financial, rollout, and delivery knowledge has produces a series of poor choices resulting in lost business and revenue. 3. Key players blaming everyone but themselves for poor performance. 4. Abusing and underpaying recent college grads. 5. Employee turnaround too high.
Long hours. Software architects are overcomplicated and there are too many dependencies from other dev teams.
Terrible management and tons of corruption
i don't have a lot of things to mentioned.
No respect for workers work/life balance. Racial preference for Israelis in leadership. Work contracts with client companies are designed to foster adversarial relationships. Titles do not match levels of responsibility.
A lot of food and organization of projects.
not so good work life balance depending on what team you are joining.
Sometime too many decision makers
main cons is no work life balance
Salary and employee compensation are low. Don't expect annual bonuses. Company events are are pretty low-grade.
communication and learning for new graduates is awful.
not a lot of support
As in many big companies, sometimes people are not values as contributors. but as resources on an excel sheet, that sometimes are dispensible, regardless their performance.
Long hours. Software architects are overcomplicated and there are too many dependencies from other dev teams.

All pros and cons are from my perception or experience while working at Slalom: - There's some flexibility to drive your career where you want, but you'll also be required to maintain ""check the box"" expectations based on your role to a fault...Given this, you'll have to overextend to grow expertise outside of your role, leading to burnout - and this is only becoming more prominent as Slalom grows and becomes more corporate. More corporate tends to equal ""stay in your box"" and less room for to take a path less traveled. - There are still some great people here, despite them becoming harder to find as Slalom continues to grow.
If you are early in your design career, your problem space is defined so meeting expectations is easy.
Almost everyone is super friendly and wants to do what's right, a lot of people have been there a long time, leadership has an open door and are very approachable, company does really well

Healthy work environment with an emphasis on W/L balance
The great culture is driven by curiosity and inclusion. They invest in their people and take great pride in the impact they make through their clients.
- Great Work Life Balance - Amazing company culture - People First company
The people I've met at Slalom have proven to be some of the smartest, most compassionate coworkers I've ever had. Truly everyone I've worked with has been on the same page about treating one another internally and externally kindly and compassionately. This attitude is infectious and has helped me through tough days. The work itself has also proven rewarding for me, as I've been able to make a real impact in the community. This is also a positive of Slalom's local market, 'franchise' model: Slalomers can work within their local community and have a hand in making a real difference. This does come with a qualifier, however, as I've been extremely fortunate to have fallen into the work I have. The benefits are also good overall, with over 20 days of combined PTO.
Slalom fosters a positive and inclusive work environment, where everyone's ideas and contributions are valued. It truly feels like a supportive and collaborative team.

good work life balance and benefits
Coming from Big 4, this is a safe haven where the company genuinely practices what it preaches. I genuinely enjoy the great people that I work with, the work that I do, and the fact that leadership (at least in my market) has an open door policy for anyone and everyone. The Slalom Recruitment team knows what they are doing and hire some of not only the brightest and hardest working, but also some of the most genuine, caring, and kind people that I have the pleasure of knowing and working with!

","I can not think of any cons to share
Work life balance isn't good if you want to try to get promoted. Holiday and PTO benefits are laughable. Promotion process is ridiculous. Pay isn't great vs comparable companies/roles in industry. Leadership is basically nonexistent and solely focused on themselves.
Where to begin. There is zero accountability here and expectations are low. Don't expect to have influence over changing ANYTHING - if I had a dime for every time I've heard ""that's the way Slalom is"" or ""it's likely not going to change"" I would be a rich person. The lack of agility, process improvement and leadership is staggering. They claim to be a feedback focused company yet, don't provide feedback unless it's positive - no one knows how to give constructive, actionable feedback - you're supposed to be ""nice"" which helps no one. If you've been there forever, especially sitting in Seattle, you love it because favoritism rules and you never have to be innovative. New viewpoints are considered threatening despite hiring people with...new viewpoints. Despite being a large company, there is NO COO. There is a lot of bad behavior that is excused away. I chose Slalom for its reviews, however I could not be more disappointed with how it actually is for people that are motivated by challenging work. There just isn't any.
- most colleagues aren't driven by ambition or the desire to do a good job or deliver above and beyond - local market structure gets in the way of bigger aspirations - consultants lack functional and industry specialization - prone to hype (eg GenAI), with less focus on actual substance - Slalom lacks people development opportunities
Note: Slalom operates in a hub-and-spoke model, meaning local markets each have different cultural nuances - I feel like it would be challenging to work here if you're someone who need more structure. - Benefits are lower than most consulting companies of the same size but the culture, flexibility, and trust makes it well worth it for me (early career)
Being a services company, we have to do events on nights and weekends instead of during work hours. Only 6-7 paid holidays Medical Benefits could be stronger but, they are good
People who have been at the company for a while and leadership are quite stuck in their ways and don't want to change. Being a consulting company, you'd think that a variety of voices and opinions would be welcome and wanted, but that was not the case. For how large of a company it is, it is very surprising how often people are making up their own solutions that used to work and are not willing to follow the processes that have been set up to scale the company. Management did not support when the workload and hours were consistently over what the role was supposed to be. They said to reduce hours but did nothing to help adjust or define the scope and workload expectations. Feedback was sparse, and direction and guidance was hard to get, as was support. When management did lean in, the guidance was often times confusing and also conflicted with previously provided information. The tagline of being 'fiercely human' is shared often as something the company values, but unfortunately upper management and leadership do not embody that in the day to day. This was the least caring, most stressful, and most dehumanizing work environment I have experienced due to the management and poor leadership.
Promoting the company ""brand"" is more important than actually following the company values. There is very little transparency. They preach work/life balance but there are a ridiculous amount of work events outside business hours. You are looked down upon if you are not consistently showing up to the events. Because Slalom is your family, you don't need a real one. Would be a great place for young and single individuals.
Over the years, Slalom is slowly becoming another Accenture or Deloitte. The original 'people first' approach is now becoming numbers first. The small team feeling is gone and now we are just a number.
1. My local market is going from fully remote to 3-4 days in the office mandatory. A lot of my colleagues were hired in remotely and are panicking about what this means. Office is not set up to have this many people there (loud, cluttered, not enough desks) and is not a great fit for all people. 2. People are pretty homogeneous - a lot of drinking culture in my office, people make connections through events and parties. As a non-drinker, that makes it tough to engage with colleagues. 3. Benefits are really not great. 17 days of starting PTO sounds great, until you realize that there is 0 days of paid sick leave. Industry standard is 10 days of sick leave, so if you take that out of the PTO allowance you only have SEVEN days left. This is compounded by the return to office policy, as now workers have to choose between going into the office sick or taking one of their limited PTO days. There are no exceptions for working remote anymore and you must be in the office. I’m glad I got out.
Project Assignments: Depending on the project assignments and client engagements, workloads and project durations can vary. Some projects may require longer hours or travel, which can impact work-life balance. Client Dependency: As a consulting firm, Slalom's work is often tied to client demands and projects. This may mean that employees have less control over the type of projects they work on and may need to adapt to changing client needs. Limited Industry Focus: Slalom's client portfolio spans across industries, which may limit the depth of expertise in a specific industry for some employees who prefer specialization.
No RSUs Not really too many bad things
As the title says, I’ve been super stressed, working on tasks that are no where in my job description which I am forced to do despite me mentioning that it is not my area of expertise. Super Unrealistic expectations in the team I work which is making my life a disaster. Most of my coworkers do not have sufficient knowledge and are not qualified enough to be in the position they are which is making things worse for me.
The last few years have been very bad with high attritions and dirty work place politics. Its very common to see someone else take credit of all your work and be rewarded for it. The company is full of ""leaders"" who lack basic understanding of the work they deliver/sell and have 0 accountability but are there because they are friends with the right people and are white. The HR is completely helpless and policy is driven by practice MDs , they create exceptions as and when they want. The ""leaders"" lack any sense accountability and would hide behind random events to cover up their failures. In 2022 they tried to whitewash a lot of problems as ""growing pains"" however when you look at the numbers they were actually shrinking ! Now they've started attributing all the problems to the ""economy"" and ""market conditions"". When the times are good though it's all because of them , when they were accepting promotions every 6 months based on hardly one or two successful sales pitches , no one said that "" the market is so hot or the economy is doing so well and selling in this market is a cake walk"" It' was all because of their handwork and talent but when things go south it's because of external factors.
The pressures of managing client delivery, practice leadership, internal morale, etc is overwhelming and has led to many exiting the firm
The infrastructure and opportunities are significantly limited. There can be massive turnover due to a lack of opportunities for growth. Even if you make your own success and sell work, you won't necessarily be valued.
If you are not very outspoken then you are not recognized as a good resource. They don't bother about your technical skills but more on your other skills. They hire you by having a lot of questions/presentations, etc. but when it comes to providing work they forget what they have selected you for. If there is cultural difference, then it becomes more difficult for you.
Struggle to find good people leaders
1. You have to be always wired as it comes with consulting, however it is contrary to what they claim. 2. My leader wants work to be done off hours but doesn’t let me put those hours as chargeable. I have heard the same thing from my colleagues. This is one way for people to get promoted, as in, have people work double hours and charge half. Engagement are a hit. 3. I have seen people getting multiple promotions within a short span of time. e.g consultant to Director in 4 years. Good for the person but not so good for the junior folks as a person with a title and no real life experience is leading them. 4. Now I am being asked to come to office to warm up chairs. 5. I live closer to downtown office, which is a train ride away and down own a car. I have had clients in suburbs and had to pay out of pocket for uber and commuter, and we were told we cant reimburse. 6. Annual goal setting is a joke and you are on your own to put your priorities and goals—seriously? 7. Some leaders lack basic social skills, including speaking and writing. Everybody should be made to write a paper/give writing sample as the interview process to weed out folks. 8. My practice leaders don’t have a standard methodology that they can apply(process, templates etc) and everything is on the fly. **Anybody can put two and two together and infer why Slalom is able to bid low
Can't complain but no layoffs did result in promotion freezes and cost cutting.
Can sometimes be annoyingly liberal-biased and allows that to enter the workplace unchecked, but otherwise zero cons. This company respects your time and aims for 40 hour work weeks.

- lack of projects - layoffs (they will say they don’t do layoffs but do performance firing when hard times come) - no diversity - projects are under staffed so you are doing the work of 2-3 people - too many PMs and barely any technical people
The org itself is just a bunch of disorganized liars looking for a scapegoat.

It's a micro-management factory. Management loves to pat themselves on the back and dictate your every task. If you want to think freely and make a difference in the company and for clients, then go elsewhere. If you want to mind your time, have your day-to-day dictated by your manager, and have no career ambitions, then Slalom is your place to be.
No cons for working at Slalom
None that come to mind
So far I haven’t encountered any cons
All pros and cons are from my perception or experience while working at Slalom: - Slalom has seemed to have lost the plot on their core values. Slalom seems to be growing without much of a strategy, except to follow in other large consulting firms footsteps. As Slalom grows, their differentiation has dwindled. - Less competitive pay and benefits compared to other Big 4 / established consulting firms. - Lots of ""drinking the kool-aid""...to a point where, ironically, colleagues tend to come off less genuine to fit themselves into the mold. - Some Senior Leadership did not practice the core values that they preached. Lots of smoke and mirrors.
Once you pass the more junior stage, you will still have to take on illy written SOWs that require problem discovery that if you are lucky, your sales partner is good, and you get bill hours for it. If you are unlucky which is common, you don’t get to fix it and have to deliver against the client or the SOW owners imagination. Imagine that craziness as an experienced UX leader because the slalom XD leadership has no ethics when managing senior designers. They will use you as button pushers AKA design monkeys. There is very little respect in that process. I have personally seen them do this to 3 of the very senior & reputable & well respected leaders. At the end they just lost all interest at work and got managed out or had to quit.
Leadership has taken their eye off the ball for keeping the best people long term

Leadership has taken their eye off the ball for keeping the best people long term
emphasis and priorities on how to add value to the company change quarterly
We partner with our clients on their hardest challenges. While they bring great growth opportunities, it can be hard and require strong planning, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.
- No added and reliable benefits for TC - Moderately pay scale company
Slalom is still, at its core, a consulting company. So, a dearth of incoming client projects can disproportionately affect the company's economic outlook and day-to-day life for local markets and their teams. This year, the market I work out of has seen massive changes in leadership and how we operate; as a result, I've become more and more disillusioned with the company's 'culture' and how it continuously sells itself as 'people first' and 'fiercely human consulting.' Another major con is the concept of 'the bench', a term meant to define the time spent not working on a billable client project. The word itself has always stood out to me as cold and derisive, as many who find themselves 'on the bench' have little to no control over their situation. Team members are encouraged by leadership to constantly network, sell ourselves and the value of our work, and when necessary, learn entirely new skillsets to make us more 'sellable.' Leaders in my market have spoken to me about this due to my skillset being seen as 'niche' and not as 'sellable' on its own. My first conversation with a new director not long ago was not a 'get to know you.' Instead, their focus was hearing about how my quarterly review went and how I could best move forward as a sellable asset for the company, including learning a new skillset and building out an entirely new capability while fully staffed at 45 hours per week on a long-term client project. Further, about two months ago, leadership in my market mandated a return to the office for those not billing their full 40-45 hours per week to a client project. So, for those partly or full on the bench, Tuesdays and Thursdays now mean mandatory in-office days with a 9 a.m. bench meeting for each practice. Attendance is taken at these meetings. If you're found to have missed that day for any reason, you will be docked a day of PTO. Our practice was told via a mass email that, flatly, there are no real exceptions to this: you can either make it or expect to be docked PTO. They've realigned and flattened our org. as well, taking away direct reports from some not at the Principal level (a consulting term) and giving their direct reports to other Principals. This was met with mass confusion, as a long, seven-paragraph email sent at 8:08 p.m. on a Wednesday evening — the changes would go into effect the following Monday — was how we were all told this would be happening at 8:08 p.m on a Wednesday evening. Those who would be losing direct reports or gaining new managers found out all of one day before everybody else. How my market — one of Slalom's largest — has handled this difficult economic climate has been troubling, to say the least. It has undercut the 'people first' message I was sold on upon my joining last year. In speaking to colleagues, there is a foreboding feeling that the situation wont improve; in fact, many who have worked at Slalom for years feel it can still get worse.
As with any consulting firm, there can be times of high workload and tight deadlines.
Mixed results with your people managers. They could be great or totally absent from your time here.
Lacks diversity in talent. Micromanaging environment. I've seen some people play favoritism. Some senior leaders displayed passive aggressiveness, especially when you're in between client projects. Pay is decent but not as competitive compared to the other markets. Also, no work-life balance, parents heads up.
Cliquey poor bereavement leave Did not allow me to take more than 3 days for a parent passing
You might need to get your own gigs.
No cons, it is a great place to work!
Nothing I am against right now
Lots of bench time currently but that’s due to recession, don’t know what it’s like at other times for an Associate Consultant
Can be a big work load at times
The worst thing i have to say about Slalom is that they’re hybrid. There’s an expectation that you’ll come into the office periodically.
Too nice - below average performers are allowed to stick around or even get promoted. There is a culture where conflict is avoided at all costs, constructive feedback is rare to avoid hurting anyones feelings. Local model creates unfair challenges to new markets as promotions are based on standard corporate metrics - easy to hit in mature markets, almost impossible in new markets. Immature training programs with an overemphasis on technology. People from industry are not given consulting training, especially presentation, communication skills and business foundations. Pay does not keep up with competitors, is a hard company to stay at for multiple years as pay increases lag inflation. Decentralized industry knowledge, experts and content, makes it impossible to compete with B4
Unconscious bias runs rampant at Slalom. I’ve been here many years and Minority executives will get less praise than their white counterparts. Promotion will be harder for them. but easier to put a minority on a performance plan because “since the beginning they never felt like us” None of this can be shared publicly. Culture is such a strong element at Slalom, people would be shocked and deny any accusation that they treat minorities different than white leaders, especially in liberal office locations. The only way to share what’s happening is anonymously here. Even the President has no interest in hearing about lack of diversity and you definitely should not raise the issue in front of him
Feels like frat house at times with all the hoo rah and social stuff. Probably won’t be promoted if you don’t participate.
- No added and reliable benefits for TC - Moderately pay scale company
Slalom is still, at its core, a consulting company. So, a dearth of incoming client projects can disproportionately affect the company's economic outlook and day-to-day life for local markets and their teams. This year, the market I work out of has seen massive changes in leadership and how we operate; as a result, I've become more and more disillusioned with the company's 'culture' and how it continuously sells itself as 'people first' and 'fiercely human consulting.' Another major con is the concept of 'the bench', a term meant to define the time spent not working on a billable client project. The word itself has always stood out to me as cold and derisive, as many who find themselves 'on the bench' have little to no control over their situation. Team members are encouraged by leadership to constantly network, sell ourselves and the value of our work, and when necessary, learn entirely new skillsets to make us more 'sellable.' Leaders in my market have spoken to me about this due to my skillset being seen as 'niche' and not as 'sellable' on its own. My first conversation with a new director not long ago was not a 'get to know you.' Instead, their focus was hearing about how my quarterly review went and how I could best move forward as a sellable asset for the company, including learning a new skillset and building out an entirely new capability while fully staffed at 45 hours per week on a long-term client project. Further, about two months ago, leadership in my market mandated a return to the office for those not billing their full 40-45 hours per week to a client project.

Seniority can bring complacency, still wrestling with becoming a global company with a local market presence
Nothing that I can think of
Not many cons to be honest.
We are growing FAST - the cool part is that our growth is 100% organic. No mergers or acquisitions and the mess that comes with that type of growth. We have very strong alliance partnerships which help us define our growth strategy. With this growth, comes ambiguity, which frankly I think most consultants thrive in. You have to be ok with the unknown for a while. ""Building the plane while flying it."" You have to have a growth mindset to be at slalom! Not really a con for some though. Salaries are fair, but won't be the top of the pay scale. There are other non-monetary trade offs which isn't enough for some folks.
the only downside I can think of may be developer specific for salesforce roles. I work with a lot of associate developers, it's really difficult to get time with senior developers. there just aren't enough of them to go around. I don't feel like I get a lot of guidance for code-related best practices. most of the best practices I have learned come from books, code I've had to read from previous developers, and courses I purchased on my own. if you need non-code-related help though you'll have no problems finding it at slalom. everyone is extremely knowledgeable and eager to help.
In the local offices, you get more of the tight-knit culture where everyone knows each other but the projects are also a bit limited, however I personally way prefer this to having to travel for projects or work weird hours with different time zones. There is a global team that may have more variety to choose from however that comes with its own challenges like less community and working with time differences. Also, focusing on internal initiatives and sales opportunities gets you noticed more than doing great work for clients but this isn't really a problem if you enjoy doing that anyway, it can just be difficult to juggle if you're on a demanding project.
Honestly, there are not any worth mentioning, it would be so nit-picky.

No downsides at all to Slalom
From my perspective there are no cons.
There PTO build up takes way too much time.
I worked at Slalom for 6 months, in that time my manager was on leave for my first 5 months. The person who trained me did not give me the time of day, and when I asked for help he was very dismissive. I taught myself everything I could and finally felt comfortable in the role. When my manager returned, I expressed what happened, and she said she would help train me. We were to meet weekly in person, and she was to assign me trainings. We met one time, after that she cancelled every other time with no explanation. She started taking things off my plate without telling me, and never provided trainings. I was made to feel extremely incompetent, and like a complete failure. I had NO SUPPORT from anyone on the team. When I left, they did not even address my departure, I disappeared from thin air. For a ""fiercely human"" company, they are FAR from it.
A lot of internal disorganization while growing
Unrealistic expectations of the workload
work is a bit slow and layback
If you’re seeking structured and rapid promotions, this may be difficult to achieve.
Meager PTO accrual rate No 401k match in your 1st year Growing pains that come with rapid growth
currently no projects for anyone to do.
Pay? I know many folks that have taken a pay-cut for a better work-life balance, but theoretically, if you look at the ""hourly rate"" for most individuals, chances are that it has probably increased since they have come over from their previous firm. Although the pay may not be as high as some other organizations or firms out there, I personally am able and willing to let-go of the somewhat negligible pay decrease for the increased enhancement and benefit to my mental and physical health - as well as the ability to actually spend time with family and friends
Utilization over everything else, no go-to-market strategy outside of that
Low compensation. No raises this year.

Everyone is doing everything and so nothing is truly prioritized
No downsides at all to Slalom
Don't really have critical feedback to help individuals identify areas of personal growth/blind spots. The ""niceness"" is a little too much, in this respect.
Staff augmentation vs. consulting at its core
From my perspective there are no cons.
When I first joined Slalom, my market was lean and scrappy and operated like a start up. This worked well at the time. Slalom grew from 4k to 12k employees in my time there, providing new opportunities to early career talent and expanding globally. With all this change, the recruiting, hiring, onboarding and internal operations remained the same- scrappy, under-resourced, and disorganized. Consultants and leaders billing full-time to clients had to take on internal operational roles just to keep the market afloat (e.g., run new hire onboarding sessions). By hiring only for sold roles (not bench), new hires could expect to start at the client on day one following a one hour PowerPoint onboarding. I had new hires with zero consulting experience reaching out to me asking where the training was, as they didn't feel equipped to take on clients on day one. As a leader, I was also tasked with selling and staffing roles. Without hiring to the bench, we rarely had the right resources available to staff at the right time. This resulted in either a mad dash to get offer eligible employees hired immediately, staffing the wrong people, or often losing the opportunity due to lack of resources.
There PTO build up takes way too much time.

I was lucky enough to have a good manager, My manager was always on my side regarding disputes against customers, because the customer is not always right and also he helped me with working out a schedule that would help me be able to work while i'm in college instead of just firing me.
This company gets a lot of negative reviews. I think all depends where you work and who you work with. The first few weeks the management was awful and then was replaced. I enjoyed my time there a lot more after that. I had great customers, i got along with all my employees and the management was great.

","Their employees are over worked
As an asst Manager I did not do the hiring of cashiers. The quality and dependability of the new incoming cashiers were sub par, many disn not know how to count money in general and made it difficult to rely on their drawer count, in which you as an asst Manager are responsible for. Also many were not reliable to even show up for their assigned shift. Also this is a fast paces job you must be able to handle the work load especially on truck day. And the pay for asst Managers is way too low for the responsibility you have. Hardest job I ever had for the least amount of pay.
The pay is crap for the amount of work they expect of you. The only people that can be fulltime is the mangers. Even if you are short handed and need to work over 40 they won't allow it they don't even want 1 min of overtime. I have worked for alot of companies and this is the only one that I have ever felt like they didn't care about there employees and the work load they expect of them. They will send someone to fix a lock on a door in 2 days but let you work in 95 degree heat inside a store with no ac in the middle of the summer for a month and a half.
Favoritism shown - not enough communication between management and employee - hours cut back drastically making you work harder the short time you are there. - .25 cent raise after working and sweating your tail off for a year - 25 cent raise!
My manager was unapproachable, She provided instructions very quickly during training. I found my manager personality immature and she had a spirit to ridicule staff and gossip with her close employees. Most employees couldn't trust her.
Big trucks are come very often
stress, pressure, finding help, keeping help for little pay.
Dealing with thefts at the store
Decrease in payroll hours available
Slow business, not too much to do when the store is dead and wished to do more with my time. First time training was very confusing and wasn't too thoroughly explained. Wasn't until second day when I fully understood my tasks and was explained the right way to do things to my understanding.
They closed my store abruptly with no prior notice. The only options for transfer were over an hour travel each day from home for an extra 500 a year.
I’m not sure yet but I will update. The only thing I can think of is the bi-weekly pay and the fact that I haven’t learned how to up date any information online yet. You can’t see your hours online that you’ve worked either.
Pay not high enough for the position
There were 2 assistant managers however the other assistant manager didn't have to pull an open to close shift as the manager said was a requirement. So the 2 female managers pulled an open to close, 8am-9or10pm, and he never did. Also when audit/inventory came around he also never did anything extra to prepare and never did resets. The manager never stood up and made him pull his own weight which made it more work and unfair for the other assistant. The associates where there for stocking and mainly register whenever we were allowed to have them on schedule but that wasn't often.
None, it was okay place to work.
Part time job is a downside
Turnover is very high at store level.
Customers are frustrating and exhausting
bad customers, random calls to come in, no call no shows
Upper management was not good No good pay.
The staff is very minimal, just enough to cover every shift. Wish more hours would be available to hire another cashier and stocker to work every shift also. Not enough time to run register and complete required tasks during schedule shifts.
Hours time money people bosses

Pay was very very very sucky
There is no cons to working there
Upper management allows associates to remain in dangerous work environments. No support for store level employees from district and regional management. DMs berate store level employees. They expect store employees to work with skeleton crew which does not allow adequate breaks. There is retaliation from upper levels when a grievance is filed.
Not easy to have work - life balance
No AC in my store, always having to close, can't void or cancel transactions, always have to call for ASM for everything because they don't let cashiers do anything except scan items and tell people their total, seriously, imagine having a long line with 10 people and some old lady wants to take something off because they don't have enough money or something and you have to call an ASM who is all the way in the back of the store to come and take it off.
Theft. Usually these stores are not in great areas so there are many people coming in and stealing, Management does its best to keep them out but its not enough and not worth your life.
Expected to do everything, only 2 oe 3 people working at a time, often called in after morning shifts
Stressful environment, no help from higher up.
-low pay - unsafe work enivornment
Time consuming and patience needed
Having to work so much freight with little time.
disrespect from coworkers customers and from cooperate
Long hours depending on staffing levels
Underpaid, overworked, doesn't care about health or well-being
none that i can really think of
The real downside is pay for management for the amount of time that they put into the stores. I felt like everyone else was paid pretty fairly, but I felt like the managers, especially the store manager did not receive enough recognition or pay.
Not really many cons, being retail there are some last minute schedule changes
Not easy on the body, when understaffed they throw the same amount of freight down on you making work conditions really rough and sometimes unsafe (especially for shippers!) On your body.

Good benefits, beautiful campus and driven colleagues.
one of the best universities great research activities
Love the people I work with Structured schedule Good work/life balance
Learned a lot and nice facilities
Great role challenging in a good way
You're surrounded by lot of smart people who are working really hard. Hyde Park is amazing and downtown Chicago is a short train ride away.
It was a good time
Good professors and nice classmates
I worked in the Career Advancement Office and gained a lot of experience in applying for jobs and networking with potential employers, just from working as a student assistant. I also really enjoyed working with most of the staff and advisors over the course of my few years there.
Great professors and students here!
Easy Work, Most Coworkers, Benefits
Renowned faculty, challenging work and learn lots of new things
UChicago is okay generally - good benefits, usually decent pay. Neurology department (in the Biological Sciences Division) is not recommended.
Benefits are great and meet a lot of great people there
Hospital/College environment Transportation is convenient
Lot's of academic freedom. Good resources and great people
Diversity, free expression, enjoyable work, a variety of positions you can move around until you find your niche and you can move up into different roles as your skill set becomes more advanced. Working with passionate people who are engaged. Great benefits!
Nice coworkers Management is nice Pay well
Amazing intellectual environment, professors and fellow students
Love the people I work with Structured schedule Good work/life balance
Learned a lot and nice facilities
Good benefits tuition aid good healthcare plans
Great dental, health insurance. University is good at getting the things you need to onboard.
Good professors and nice classmates
Great professors and students here!
Could do other schoolwork during shifts very easily.
- Good health care benefits + tuition reimbursements - Stunning campus and intellectual environment
Some people were nice and friendly
","nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
Not anything I can think of.
- The program promises a lot of institutional and technical support that never materialized. - Many of the partner organizations are very poorly managed and not at all organized. - Had almost zero data work to do. The partner organization seemingly just wanted executive assistants rather than data analysts. I informed the university many times but they didn't seem to care and continued to place new fellows with the organization despite this. - They would occasionally have guest experts comes speak to the fellows, but it only happens every 6 months for a year long fellowship and on both occasions we were not informed until a couple days before, so almost everyone had scheduling conflicts.
nothing to complain. It is good.
Cafe stays open during finals week (in contrast to all other student-run shops on campus)
Benefits are subpar. Salaries are still relatively low. Would benefit from more collaboration with other Chicago research institutes/universities.
I do not like the hyde park location, but that is just personal preference- I prefer a downtown location.
Where fun comes to die culture
None that come to my mind
In some cases it can feel decentralized.
commuting can be a lot.
Sometimes you are the sole grader, so a lot to do in a short amount of time
Chicago is not a city known for diversity.
Salaries are not competitive to market. Promotions occur after a certain amount of years worked, not based on skillset or achievements.
not too much cons here
Uncertain hours but otherwise not any problems
Need to be social with strangers
very stressed during final weeks
Formal processes and policies lacking for solving PI - student conflicts.
Pay is lesser. Hierarchical and bureaucratic.
obviously academic pay is lower than private sector pay.
Depending on your department, you might work a lot more.
Zoom and virtual environment was an adjustment during covid
Mildly competitive salary. Could be more.
i cannot think of any cons
high living cost in chicago
Very toxic environment. Always trying to downgrade their graduate students and to disregard their value as worker
- Dominated by hospital and its directives, leaving basic research to sort itself out
No pressure for fast growth
faculty tend to look down upon staff...
Postdoctoral Fellow no support other stipend to cover insurance
Toxic environment at times and too much politics
No serious downsides to report. Although, some of this may depend on the professor.
Lack of support by upper management
Getting the first research assistant job is tricky
they always overworked me n nighttime shiftgs
I worked at the social work school and felt pretty disconnected from the university community
The campus overall is decentralized so hard at times to find certain departments.
Not enough growth opportunities/upward mobility
So hard to get management to change their views on clinical care, despite receiving feedback from multiple clinicians who actually care for patients. Pay is fair, not great but not terrible. Schedule flexibility is atrocious.
faculty tend to look down upon staff...
N/A as this would be discussed as an opportunity for growth!
Postdoctoral Fellow no support other stipend to cover insurance
Toxic environment at times and too much politics
Lack of support by upper management
Small office space and repetitive
Multiple locations across Chicago can feel disconnected from Main campus culture
they always overworked me n nighttime shiftgs
I worked at the social work school and felt pretty disconnected from the university community
The neighborhood is dangerous .
payment is not high. Live here is expensive. Engineering major is not strong.
pay on the low side
Underpaid. Projects can be unrealistic.
Highly malignant faculty member(s) in the Computer Science department
Student worker position and not a full on position
Small pay increases year to year
All employees except upper management get the same minuscule raises irrespective of individual differences in effort and ability. Most employees have little practical hope of promotion or significant raises during their careers.
Work is mundane. Leadership and direction are lacking. Support systems are not supportive.
Very challenging to maintain work life balance, take time off etc.
some officers are not professional. For example, my HR is terrible. location of the university is not good: crime, wind, cold, and no parking spots. and the university does not care about these problems but pretends
Salary is lower than industry average
The environment at UChicago is pretty tough. A lot of grad students are overworked, and it often doesn't feel like admin or your department have your back. You're paid like a grad student, which is underpaid. But, the grad students just unionized so things are looking a bit better maybe.
Lots of inconsistent hours in the job
N/A as this would be discussed as an opportunity for growth!
The pay is not great, especially if you’re a student, and depending on the specific people you work with, flexibility around class/finals schedules or mental health leave was not always honored with the most understanding (I.e. you were granted it but it was obvious that people were frustrated).
Aside from Faculty, unprofessional culture. Location Crime
Small office space and repetitive
Multiple locations across Chicago can feel disconnected from Main campus culture
The neighborhood is dangerous .
Women are treated as assistants to male staff and expected to work more (often for less pay because pay scale is based on academic degrees, not work quality). Discriminatory promotion/hiring practices for long-term staff. Management doesn't do anything beyond ""conversations"" when we report hostile work environments. Clinical coordinator suite has no windows. Some coordinators asked to come in at 2 or 3 am to enroll study participants in emergency room, but no accountability for teammates who don't come in.

Aside from Faculty, unprofessional culture. Location Crime
Difficult to feel too connected and motivated for remote work

Was let go due to the fact that I confronted my immediate supervisor about his behavior with a colleague of ours and of course denied that anything was going on. No support from the current dean and main he department. 34 1/2 years of service.
No raises in my field No related degrees offered to enroll
I worked remotely there which means I didn't get to enjoy the campus as much as I would have liked. Apart form that all good
Decentralization occasionally creates slower workflows. Central offices can be short staffed at times which creates the delays.
Favoritism Rushed training Paying to park
None. Everything was great . May be the weather is a bummer
A lot of optics and politics around the position
Funding is sparse, typical undergrad research position
Extensive hours Lack of salary raise
Pay could be better for staff. Fast paced work environment can feel hectic. Not many opportunities for growth.
Heavy workload and super stressful
None come to mind, I loved it
A lot of the patrons ask questions that they could easily google, interrupting school work.
- Leadership hold faculty beholden to none and do not support staff members - Leadership enjoys being in a position of opposition - Resistant to change, even where it is a foregone conclusion - Your ability to grow is highly dependent on your supervisor - No real merit raises - Services and infrastructure spread too thinly for increased faculty and student numbers
Pay was not enough for the amount of work

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/BD-Reviews-E88.htm,"The BD onboarding team made me feel like I was their top priority. So many individuals worked together to ensure I had all the necessary tools. The introductions, tech support, learning platforms, etc. all helped direct my onboarding process. The professionalism, cultural inclusion, and hospitality at BD are welcome changes from other employers.
Great collaboration from Senior Management to my direct team. Everyone is willing to help in preparing me to make a difference in doing what is right by the Company and its standards and by the healthcare facilities I call on.
Benefits, but they are slowing getting worse as the years go on
Well established company that has good pay and benefits
BD MDS has historically been a great place to work. The people in the weeds doing the work are generally helpful and friendly. Typically, there are a good amount of resources available to push the work forward (2023 is an exception). Growth opportunities are available for those that are motivated.
Same as any other corporate job. Somehow BD has a good reputation but any factor that made that true has been taken away.
I have found BD to be the best company I have worked for in my career. Team collaboration and working with a group who unities and does what is right is a formula for success. One of the great things about working for BD is the ability to help others. When you work for a medical device company you have the ability to help others around the world. What a great feeling.
Incredible business culture and support programs
I am so glad to have joined the BD team. I strongly recommend joining this international, continually growing organization that values their employees.
Lots of smart people. Big name company within the industry.
Started as a contractor and has been some of the best experience and people to work with I've ever had.
Excellent culture, great new and old leadership
Great pay and experience if you are in the right group.
Well Managed Company with alot of opportunity
Opportunity for advancement, fair pay
Fair across the board as far as compensation goes.
Location, people, networking opportunities, growth
Good place for innovation, work environment is nice. Good benefits and can see a long career at this company
Good benefits Great networking opportunities
The management is really nice, helpful and informational. Management encourages development and learning by offering to pay for certifications and classes to further your education. A really laid back environment with decent coworkers.
They have great opportunities within the company, different platforms, and products to work on and learn. Lots of training programs are provided. The company has a flexible work culture.
Excellent Employer to work for
Nice compensation, Good people that want to make a difference
Great Work life Balance and Culture
Everything has been great! From onboarding to interaction with team! I love it and would recommend it to anyone considering working here at BD!
Flexible work schedule, nice corporate campus, good benefits, good pay
Great pay and experience if you are in the right group.
The job is Fully remote
coworkers, leadership, training all top of the line!
Diversified businesses with strong leadership. They encourage you to move around within the company which helps with personal and professional development.

Team spirit and very friendly colleagues
Diversity. Nice colleagues. Good benefits.
Great company with employee care and great opportunities
Great benefits package, flexibility with hours depending on management, clear direction with project goals, and support in making inter-departmental moves through education opportunities.
The management is really nice, helpful and informational. Management encourages development and learning by offering to pay for certifications and classes to further your education. A really laid back environment with decent coworkers.
Wonderful people. Meaningful purpose which is exciting and inspiring. Solid company with growth and enough diversification to weather economic uncertainties. People and inclusive centric culture. Growth and development focused but does require individual ownership (as it should be in my pov) to gain the most benefit. Have embraced flex-hybrid work arrangements beyond the pandemic. Very active and engaged Associate Resource Groups which creates a great opportunity for community both locally and globally.
Easy work for good pay. Also climate controlled environment and clean workplace. You get 4 days off at a tine.
Helping nurses and other healthcare professionals do their jobs better, easier.
Pay is ok, but you will work very hard for just ok pay. Great benefits. Most employees are willing to help you navigate new processes.
Great people great products great management
Co-workers were the only positive thing
Support you and career growth
Place to grow and develop resume
The pay is pretty good. The benefits and vacation time are better than the pay. You can move up pretty quickly if you're a good worker. Although, once you get closer to upper management you also have to shake the right hands and say the right things.
Job stability working for such a large company with a stable market BD does invest in the growth of associates Good benefits
Flexible schedule, managers work well with your work life balance
BD exhibits an open environment for asking questions, learning, and challenging the status quo. They openly encourage the employees to be courageous and seek empowerment. A modern company with modern leadership and ways of thinking. Their values show in the high quality and innovation in their products, as well as top place in the market. I am highly encouraged at the opportunity to work in this company.
Friendly coworkers, great benefits, set work hours, plant manager knows your name and speaks to you with genuine concern
Work life balance is good
Good pay for short time Fair time off
New Tech skills acquisition, Great Work culture, Employee friendly, Work life balance,
BD has Decent work life balance.
Great people to work with, common purpose
Awesome culture and great associates
First the good. The compensation, PTO, and benefits are still good. And the front-line associates (who do the actual work and grow the company) are great.
Mostly stable company, although prone to layoffs annually
Great people, benefits and culture!
Clearly communicated goals for 30,60,90 days. Vast training array to teach company culture, procedures, policies.
Good benefits, good salary , good people and working environment ; If you know your job you will be in a good spot!
Pension plan People Flexible work options
Provides a global experience. Products save lives.
Excellent colleagues, Good Health Benefits
-Mission you can believe in -Friendly, non-toxic, non-competitive work environment
High regard for your welfare during the onboarding process Plenty of time given to review SOP's (all you need to do the first two weeks is concentrate on the SOP's) People actually care about you and how you feel.
Great teams to work with, PTO & benefits ok
There are many opportunities to be had
Great people easy to get job
Awesome team at BD PYXIS™. Great mixture of remote and onsite work involving both remote software configuration and onsite hardware staging and implementation. Lot of opportunity to engage with people on a day to day basis both in person and via Webex. Lots of scope for public speaking and travelling.
Clean and straightforward, enjoyable co workers.
Fantastic place for a career
Great benefits and Health insurance, also a great hourly pay and chances to grow. Company protects their workers.
EHS department is working hard to improve safety, waste, environmental etc. It is a big undertaking but very encouraging.
BD is a great place to work
The employees are all knowledgeable, reliable, and helpful if you're new.

Positive Culture & Professional Approach
","There is a lot of information to take in on multiple platforms, but they have a good database of workflows to reference.
A bit overwhelming out of the gate because there is much to learn but starting anything new with a reputable global company is. That is the challenge. One I am excited to take on.
Click-ish Management only promotes friends. If you aren't in the ""fraternity"" you are ignored and bypassed for promotions. The longer you work here the worse they treat you. Take more away than they give. Working through the pandemic, they only gave us one can of soda, and an extra ""one day off"" for the 3 years we were ""essential workers""
Very liberal and more concerned about pronouns and D.E.I. than about career development.
Recently, the natural cycle of of things has bubbled some less favorable leadership to the top (thus the 3 stars). Crossing my fingers that the incompetent ones will be weeded out and a self-correction will come soon. But it may come at the cost of losing some of our best people before that correction comes. After COVID, BD culture is struggling to find its identity with hybrid work.
No upward movement unless you are a ""chosen one"" Hard work is not rewarded Annual salary increases do not keep up with inflation (3% max) Salary is not commensurate to cost of living or skill of employee Management increasingly micro-manages Typical corporate double speak, will flood their own intranet with how great they are especially regarding mental health while continuously changing policies to benefit the organization while hurting employees Health insurance is expensive if you want normal coverage There is no performance feedback at all unless upper levels of management misinterpret some data to place blame on a lower level employee There is never genuine positive feedback that causes any action, just hollow nonsense, best case scenario is that you are ignored If you are a male you might have a chance at a promotion if you use a lot of hair product, wear fashion forward clothes (that you can't afford if you work here) and constantly force that fake smile :) Your actual work performance irrelevant Company is going down the slippery slope of taking away anything pro-employee just like any other junk company. For example summer hours have been eliminated. I have been employed for over 10 years, this is a calculated review. There is no good reason to work at BD, the 10 years have been a waste of time. If you have a higher salary offer take that.
Like any company there are some silos that need to be broken down. Collaboration among groups is good but could improve in areas. Although there are areas where groups are very closed minded and are unable to see value. These are few and far between, although expanding their outlook would benefit the entire team.
Lack of development opportunities in company
A little bit of a slow hiring process in between interviews, but I think ultimately BD truly values finding the right candidate for the position, so the delay is intentional (I think)
Toxic culture forces good employees to leave and the bad ones to stay. Unwilling to improve culture and old ways of business. Nepotism.
Some serious layoffs can happen and are handled in odd ways
Company is large which can make some engagements complex..
Its hard to execute on anything. People have more power to veto ideas rather than try new things. Politics rule the world.
It is a very matrixed organization with lots of business units
Annual pay increase, insurance choices
Not much room for growth.
I don’t wish to share
Slow room for career promotions
Focus shifted from life sciences to healthcare
The pay is not adequate for the job. You’re Asked to do specialist work and get paid like a Tech.
Mediocrity does exist among teams/members. Middle management politics and influence are huge in play, especially in hiring decisions, promotions, etc. Orgs are not well-structured which affects decisions and managers not being aware of what happens in their own teams. Senior leaders did not take the time to communicate road maps for the product platforms which made future prospects very uncertain. Bloated estimates for tasks and time are wasted by employees not really contributing to projects.
Salary was not to par
Poor Upper Management, no idea about software
Outdated tech stack and low salary
Really have not seen anything until now
Many layoffs are impacting culture
Its hard to execute on anything. People have more power to veto ideas rather than try new things. Politics rule the world.
The company is a bit old school
Aren't any that I have seen in my 7 years here
None that come to mind.
can be overly process oriented
There are no badges for the gates at Eybens for employees who come on foot and have to walk all the way round the building.
Nothing I can think of that was bad
Sometimes too many priority changes
All management styles are not created equal and there isn’t much overtly done to standardize practices. Salaries are not always the most competitive in light of pension plan drop. That’s really it, great company overall.
The pay is not adequate for the job. You’re Asked to do specialist work and get paid like a Tech.
Like all large, complex orgs the learning curve early on can be high - - do reach out and develop networks of people who can support your onboarding as well as beyond. There are some processes/ systems that carry a heavy load/or confusing flow for example compliance training, new vendor and PO set ups, and payroll system. While necessary these can be frustrating. BD does believe in continuous improvement, so provide feedback, recommendations and suggestions. Definitely have seen processes improve over time. The pros far outweigh any cons for me.
Management disconnect. Long hours- 12 hour shifts
Projects can be slow due to the paperwork and processes needed for the FDA.
Training is not the best. You learn as you go.
work hard, but I enjoy it
Annual layoffs were common, regardless of performance. Always felt like the tallest blades of grass were the ones cut. The company gives off the churn and burn vibe when it comes to finding and using employees.
Some departments are toxic but if you find a good team it’s worth it
Micro management culture is killing growth
BD is a giant corporation only worried about the bottom line. They are very concerned about their ESG score and hire and promote accordingly, unfortunately to the detriment of the company and employees. Until you get to a job group 4 the bonuses are pretty weak. Morale is mostly pretty low. The higher ups are disconnected from the rest of the worker bees. It seems like they implement procedures and strategies with little input from those actually doing the work, creating inefficiencies and red tape. After seeing some great folks work hard to move up only to be first on the chopping block for layoffs is very demoralizing.
Rigid company and rigid industry With the company so large and the industry heavily regulated things can move very slow, especially if you are on the business side of things.
Strict budgets, work desks very public
No company has all of their ducks in a row, and BD is no different. Some weakness in the onboarding process: knowing which tools to learn, how to get all services connected and working properly, IT issues. Nothing very serious, however, so far as I can tell.
Overall communication cascades need improvement
R&D engineering management is not in touch with their true engineering contributors.
Will lay you off instead of paying you better wages. I was laid off after company hired 6 new support personnel. The company would not give any info as to why. I had no negative remarks in my time at company. Only reasonable thing is they didn’t want to pay my worth. This happened to multiple people on multiple positions
i dont find any negatives
Bad management. Low bonus pay. Not enough Bathrooms at the San Antonio location.
Lots of calls before the meetings.
None to name to be honest
BD is very top heavy with management. It seems everyone is some level of Director or Manager. BD claims a work life balance for employees. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Expect to work in the evenings, at night and when you’re with your family on PTO. BD is very cliquey and choice assignments or advancement could depend upon how good you are at company politicking. If you’re considering employment with BD, your biggest concern should be the constant layoffs and reorganizations. If you accept a position with BD, it would be wise to always have an updated resume and network at the ready.
Slow to innovate and always behind competitors
None that I can think of.
Lack of a dedicated onsite HR person.
none , overall very well structured company !
Layered and heavily matrixed environment No development
Decisioning is sometimes slow due to matrixed organization.
Poor Program/Project Management, Bad People's Managers
None that I can think of.
Didn't have someone to help me find areas I needed to be for training. (a new place can be like a maze) What you can do and can't do while your onboarding (not really spelled out) Feeling like you are not contributing while onboarding.
HR needs guidance on performing investigations when issues arise & plant management needs to listen more to valuable employees that have BD values & less to bosses using scapegoats for their own failures!!
Communication lacks in several areas
long drive from the city
Physically demanding nature of work results in back pain, leg and knee pain over a continued period. Most of the time work involves standing. Sometimes required to lift very heavy machinery which is risky for the lower back (my back went out twice over the past two years on this job). Hard of the legs/knees. Sometimes less than ideal working conditions, involving some risk.
Unprofessional supervision at times and not much chance to move up
Nothing bad to say about this place.
Management is not the best since most of them aren't aware of the problems inside the production area
Some of the hourly positions have very limited flexibility
In general BD has no cons
The site shutdown so there were a lot of layoffs, but BD was very generous.
People were shuffled over to the SLC location
Lots of turnover and layoffs
More gluten free options in cafeteria
Slow to get things done
Not a lot of opportunity for growth

Management is not the best since most of them aren't aware of the problems inside the production area
Lay off's almost every year
changes are not very fast
Management needs work, no clear timelines since they are always changing because of ""business needs"" but offer no other reasoning or details. Low pay compared to competition and seems like not much room for growth
You are a number and they don’t care about you.
company strategy is unclear and overly reactive
too busy company is growoing
Open left leaning politics. BD has employee resources groups that push a very left agenda. Be prepared to see events celebrating transgender visibility day and pride events where you are ‘anti LGBTQ’ if you support keep sports sex segregated of if you support restricting gender transitioning for minors. They have also been trying to hold PAC donations from politicians they don’t like. Unfortunately many associates never say anything because I assume they are afraid of hurting their reputation or even their jobs. Politics in the workplace began around 2017.
1. Big company, internal processes are slow, management is taking initiative to change this
Constant organizational and directional changes.
Career Development Opportunities need to be clearer.

- Remote, you only have to go in once a month. - You only have a $5 to $10 copay per doctor's visit so the healthcare benefit is great. - Training is great.
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and grow from NYEE as a surgical technologist. I will always cherish the experience I had working with you and some of the team.

","The manner in which COVID crises was handled.
- six-month probation, three months of which you have to go into the office. - The management team is not very supportive or understanding of the Customer Service reps. - IT/ Upper Management is constantly making horrible changes within the EPIC/MYCHART system which results in CS being bombarded with calls. - CS role is the first to respond to issues and the last to be thought about when it comes to changes being made by Upper management. - Mount Sinai's billing system is extremely disorganized and not streamlined. You will definitely feel the wrath of patients who complain about this. - Customer Service reps make $53k a year which is nearly not enough pay. - It is very difficult to get promoted within the CBO. There are many lateral positions you can transition to though where the pay will be the same.
some operating rooms are small.
Work life balance is not good
stressful, bad hours, high turnover, poor management, no growth
Management are the worst. Nurses gossip alot
poor work life balance breeding bitterness
Not many cons from this experience
less room for promotion, huge system
Work environment basically feels like a nursing home. Draining to say the least, especially when working overnights when on some days there are only 4 nurses on the floor. Good supervisors are also almost non existent. You're doing the work of transports, clerks and janitors in addition to your own nursing duties.
Could be higher in salary
The manner in which COVID crises was handled.
Management and staffing issues can be a issue
Moderate Benefits Moderate Salary Silo-ed work culture
Too big and complex sometimes.
Insurance for employees is too expensive.
coworkers were challenging to work with
Management does not always have your back even after expressing your concerns
Management could be better. Floats you to a floor with no proper training which can be dangerous. Hires lots of travelers but not staff which is odd. Switching to a different unit is difficult d/t union.
Even if I have 3 months of PTO, I couldn't even able to use 2 weeks without getting calls, messages or emails from work. So the 2 weeks of vacation is not a vacation.
I have no cons to share
No vacation time , No time for self
-Toxic culture -No mentorship -Lies about growth opportunities, salary and promotion -Don’t take anything at face value -Get everything in writing -Everyone is only out for themselves
Poor work culture, no onboarding process whatsoever
Work/life balance when not PTO, salary low in comparison to others
Most Mount Sinai Social Workers are NOT unionized.
it gets entirely too crazy in the ED . we striked but theres still not much we can do on days where we have 8+ patients(the highest amount we SHOULD have). It can become a mad house with so many patients we dont even have enough places to put them. pt can feel neglected bc we dont have time to see them as quickly/often as we should. the work load is just way too much to be safe at times.
Disorganized lab environment at times

Sometimes not enough staff to cover
Getting paid - I’ve had issues getting paid by Mount Sinai repeatedly for years (currently owed a large sum of $). As a minority reading blast of emails about diversity and inclusion that Sinai sends out, it’s insulting, just pay us.

Doesn’t take UHC Commercial insurance plans
Under pay a lot of work
You could work 24 hours, seven days a week and you will still be underwater with workload. Expectations are not set, little to no real time feedback, setting you up for a negative performance review that comes as a surprise. You are not recognized for pouring all your energy into doing a good job, you are only reprimanded for the small percentage of things that didn’t go well despite numerous challenges outside of your control. As if it’s your fault for executive leadership not setting the department up for success by creating unsustainable working conditions. Leadership is detached from the reality of the what their people need to do in order to do their jobs well.
Little to no pay increases
Temp jobs are not permanent.
people push off their work onto you consistently. management has no idea what they're doing. there is no support or interest in becoming a well functioning organization people are often disrespectful, but don't get in trouble for it. There is A LOT of micro aggression and racism here
Poor management misuse of PAs
Highly matrixed and lots of staff turnover leads to confusion
None, everyone is kind and hardworking

Prepared to be UNDER paid compared to the industry. Purdue does not and will not attempt to compete with the industry as a whole. If you're looking for $ this isn't the place for you. It will only disappoint you. There is clear intentionality to 'keep you down' here. Purdue will purposefully do things to make you less marketable, so it's harder for you to move on, such as pay for industry certifications. Working here is like being in an abusive relationship. The longer you stay the more entrenched you get and the harder it is to leave it behind. I can't help but feel that is by design. Constantly understaffed. Constant backfilling that never comes through, because they cannot get their hands on qualified talent (because they refuse to pay for qualified talent). Their solution to this is hiring students fresh out of college and egregiously underpaying them until they move on; then rinse, repeat. The most repeated tag line in this department is ""it is what it is"". Because you have no control over anything and are forced to live with it. All you can do is cope. That's what most of the people working here are doing- coping. Coping with an abusive workplace that never seems to get better.

Most of all that you will learn in your role will be from reaching out to other team members as training and leaders will not help much.
Everything is good I would recommend
great management in the OR. Great team and work environment.
Co-workers were supportive. Management was supportive to a certain extent. They can only do so much in this volatile situation with COVID.
Some support from upper management
Extensive education for new grads
- End of year bonus IF merit and productivity is met overall for the entire department. Partial bonus awarded based on total productivity. - Benefits ie., Dental, Vision, etc. - My manager is flexible and reasonable. -Good starting off position
The starting pay is a little bit more than other DME companies.
You accumulate vacation rather quickly. Rarely have I been denied vacation other than like, Christmas or something.
Excellent nursing education. Great coworkers and unit managers.
As long as you do your job, people leave you alone
Great company, with great people, and great benefits!
The pay is decent. You only work 3 days a week 12hr shifts.

The benefits, the hours, and the pay were the best! Loved having 3 12s.

This hospital gets you because they have very nice equipment, a fancy pretty new tower, nice monitors, and really nice things in the new tower. While yes it's nice, the culture is terrible with a lot of burned out nurses eating their young. Would much rather work at an older hospital with nicer people.

Not too many cons at all, I would like to have better insurance.
IT Departments are not top 100 places to work. Layoffs are hidden from other teams as “restructuring”. Once you’ve started to get to the mid-range in salary they will fire you. Leadership restructuring under the new CIO has been terrible to put it nicely. The CIO has a team that makes a show of how good they are doing but it’s all smoke and mirrors. Team members constantly have 4-5 leaders in a span of 6-12 months. Ageism is rampant in IT they bring in new staff and pay bare minimum to replace the people that have been there years and sometimes decades. The new CIO only brings in people from her old company to fill leadership roles. They will not promote from within anymore. They prefer outside talent that they can low-ball. Stay away from their disastrous IT departments. You will work extra hours and not be compensated.
The CIO and her leadership with two exceptions are not collaborative leaders, and care more about building their own empires instead of doing what is right for the patients of Banner Health. The CIO allowed a leader to ignore ethics, throw business to personal friends and former employees on a product that wouldn't work, and wasn't capable of delivering on the outcomes required. It took a few years before the backlash was enough that the CIO had no choice but to step in and do something. It seems like She had a vendetta again. The CIO prides herself on creating a great place for IT, yet stops anyone who is trying to move the ball forward and progress IT modernization. She has her own communications department that is focused on making Her look good because she's an ineffective leader.
PTO and health insurance could be better. We have to use our PTO for holidays even though administrative offices are closed.
-poor leadership -poor wages -poor workflows and processes -continually short staffed in every position
Management was terrible. Bad communication. Yearly “raise” was $.40 if you were “exceeding”
Management doesn’t listen to concerns Doctors are hard to work with
Scheduled more weekends than agreed apon during interview. Sometimes lacking in communication. New policy of having to bring labtops in patient rooms that are not efficient. Have to get detailed medical history when working in urgent care. Can only switch shifts with fellow x-ray techs and not many others to switch with. Some days working as only MA/x-ray tech in the back for call outs. Multiple coworkers calling off during the week. Management absent most of the time. Having to approve our own timecards. Some providers who order tons of tests and have patients waiting hours when it's urgent care. Maybe perform 1-10 x-rays a day. 30 minute lunch break for a 12 hour shift. Non rotating holiday schedule.
Chaotic environment, old processes and technology that doesn't work, micro managing leaders (lack of trust), lower salary compared to industry, weak benefits & holiday/PTO rolled into one bucket, no room for growth, favoritism
* Either you get a gaslighting/ micromanagement management style or you're ignored. * No support in professional development if you need to be trained * Zero support from HR when it comes to ADA accomodations, and they also put up unnecessary roadblocks. * ""Training"" style is giving you incomplete instructions then belittling you when the work isn't up to par with what they have in their head * There is no flexibility with salary - You are treated as an hourly employee while being bragged to by management about them leaving for 3 hours for a hair appointment. * Pay is 20K under what it should be. * The one time I provided feedback the response I got was, ""Well, I am going to continue to operate in the way I feel is best."" and then she told me to ignore a section on a review about how she could improve.
Short staffing, disorganized, lacking support and flexibility
LTD is always an unsure answer
Crappy cafeteria food for night shift
Too slow for me. I’m used to several patients throughout my work day. I also love to learn but we are not in a position for me to pursue the final MRI exams I need to complete secondary primary as an MRI tech with ARRT at this time.
Ratios of patients to staff can sometimes be too much
Felt overworked and not valued as an employee
Management was known to have their favorites and would not even tell you what was going on . Was told there was a strict seven absence policy but there was a person with about 20 absences who hadn’t shown up in three weeks but still showed up
No complaints from this job
Training was a MESS. All over the place. Management will feed you BS Extreme Micromanagement They do not care about recruiters. Everything gets thrown at recruiters and they will never back you up. They say they will, but will not. I have seen my team members get thrown under the bus or absolutely destroyed by leadership for things that were out of their control, but recruitment directors and leads do not care. They only want to accommodate Hiring Managers. At the end of the day they don't care for the recruiters. I had a leader who I would message or email and they would not respond back, instead, always call back. They would sometimes say things that were not appropriate or would ask me very personal questions but it was all through the phone therefore I would not have written proof. This person is known to always do this when someone messages them or emails them. I explained to my lead multiple times that a lot of things I was learning was my reaching out and teaching myself as I was not trained-to do so years ago when i started. I asked to go over the training again and refresh and they said that sounded great but never brought it up again. Just kept throwing me more reqs and ignoring my requests. Typical corporate BS "" we are a family"" and "" take all your PTO , enjoy your life"" but really they mean don't think about taking more than a week EVER.
None at all everything is good
Not great benefits, don’t feel valued by higher ups.
Very difficult to balance work & life in healthcare. Very short staff and long grueling hours. Bedside nursing was a nightmare during the pandemic at all hospitals according to my colleagues at various surrounding hospitals.
Really had to work hard to improve things
The ratio of patients to nurses makes the job very stressful and hard
- Not a ton of room for advancement unless you've been with the company for several years as most employees have been. I'm talking like maybe 3-5+ years to see a promotion for a redundant position. - Mediocre pay
Never expect to go home on time. It's the type of job that you don't go home till the work is done. Have to mentally prepare yourself for about an hour OT each shift.
It is like drinking from a firehose. There's never a downtime because your daily activities fill up the rest of the shift when everything stops being an emergency.
Ratios become unsafe when actual patient acuity is not taken into account. Mandates coming from corporate who are far removed from bedside lead to a lot of staff frustration.
Some hospitalists there are straight up rude
There were no cons in working at Banner
Often short staffed, Sometimes you get put on call for your shift.
- the pay isn't as great as other hospitals, and they are hiring new people at a way lower base pay recently - if you work a later shift, the workload is very heavy - not much room to grow
Management was known to have their favorites and would not even tell you what was going on . Was told there was a strict seven absence policy but there was a person with about 20 absences who hadn’t shown up in three weeks but still showed up

None that I can think of it
Horrible management, greedy company, understaffed, no job security, the better you are at your job, the more work you're given
Short staffed Rotating managers Increase the risk of work related stress
Day shift is constant chaos. Staff I'd like a revolving door. Management is not supportive.
I was let go for no reason and its been hell since then. After 5 months unexpectedly not finding work, I turned to unemployment for assistance. It was then that I was told for the first time I was fired for sexual harassment. This could not be the farthest from my morals and my persona in general. It was devastating, however, I heard this is a very common occurrence these days, because corporations do not have to justify firing you and then do not have to pay unemployment.
I cannot t think of any cons other than that at every hospital
Short staffed often, made some shifts very difficult.
Pay is lower than others in the same field
Banner does not care about Security. Only care about medical staff Everyone in Banner receives extra money for coming in (ESI), except security Literally 0 overtime You’re put in scary/dangerous situations where your health and life is on the line Security is not well equipped Banner Health expects us to take on situations with a person with a gun, while we don’t have a gun to defend ourselves and others This job is absolutely not worth the paycheck.
Some initial evaluations are 45-min blocks which oftentimes are not enough to get through full assessments
Traveling outside of assigned home clinic. Can get tiresome very quickly.
Does not always listen to input from residents
Some micromanagement in select departments
Hard to reach management Difficult to negotiate salary raise
Understaffed, huge workloads, people do not want to come to work there because of the bad reputation of horrible assignments, rotating managers that only look at productivity but do not know how to figure out how to make sure we get the right charges to be productive. Management places the blame on the staff instead of themselves.
Don't work here if you want to think and lead independently. They want robots not leaders. They could care less about their rural hospitals (other than sucking their money out if them). It's all about Phoenix. They may be non-profit but it's all about the money. Let's by the UofA hospitals before someone else and let them lose millions per year and squeeze the rural until they fall apart - besides they are rural ""they aren't capable of taking care of critical patients"".
Banner claims to be not for profit, but will refuse patients at the door if they can’t pay their copay in a clinic setting.
I felt undertrained and overworked.
Pay on the lower end as well as time off could be improved
Nurse management loved to micromanage and floor was always short staffed.
Very few cons. Mileage reimbursement could be better.
Terrible management Not a good work/life balance Healthcare that doesn’t care about the health of it’s employees.
Don’t feel compensated and only loop hole is if you leave the company and come back you more than likely make more coming back.
Some times treated as a number
Pay raise was sooo little
Admin its awful, they pay you the cheapest possible but will hire new people and start them at a higher pay
Pushback from superiors at Banner
A lot of classroom learning
Wage is borderline illegal, extremely stressful, understaffing
Everything else. Disconnected leadership, lots of call you are guaranteed to be called back. Poor staffing in CT. The atmosphere is pretty toxic and they will grind you down hard. They need double the staff.
bad pay no paid time off
Poor equipment, maintenance, safety concerns
Well being such a big corporation in the valley, they tend to set the pay chart examples. LOW. Management teaches : Speak as if you know what your doing and we will promote you as if you really do know.
No cons in my book, possibly needed better structure for the admin area.
Support service and loss prevention jobs don't have as much opportunity as direct patient care
I worked here for 2 years as a RN. One year on med surg one year in the ICU. It really depends on the culture of the floor you are on. But most often, management cares a lot more about titles, maintaining status and image more than they care about retaining their staff. The turnover here is so bad. When I worked med surg I was a preceptor at 9 months in as a new grad. They are constantly losing staff, the hospital is so massive its really chaotic and so many different teams involved. It takes forever to go to CT, get orders, page doctors because its always so backed up constantly. I will never work for Banner again- I feel like they only care about you as a number because they will always find more people to work for them. The acuity of the floors is terrible too. Med surg is pretty much all total cares/bed bound people at a 5:1 ratio.
There is no Indoor Heated Swimming Pool , and No Golf Putting Greens for the Employees
Nothing that I can think of
Horrible work raise and expect a lot from you
Some team members call off a lot, show up late or don’t care about their job. Some nurses are mean and I have to call them out myself for their behavior. Short staffed, no accountability, pay is ok but can be better.
Long chain of command Limited Advancement
Not enough staff, not enough time to do things for work
Hours were long and exhausting
Understaffed at times. Otherwise a great place to work.
Management uses a top down leadership approach. Nurses have more and more responsibilities with low pay. Hospital does not want to invest in using cell phones for nurses. Pretty hard to care for patients when you have to run out to the nurses station to answer phone calls and stay on the phone for 15 mins to page doctors. Unsafe ratios, unrealistic expectations, and toxic work environment. Not alot of room to grow.

Admin its awful, they pay you the cheapest possible but will hire new people and start them at a higher pay

Too short staffed causing undue burden on patients n staff.
Favoritism, politics, lack of putting patient needs first. Very high patient ratio.
bad pay no paid time off
Pay and dealing with upset team members over pay.
Management is out of touch with reality of nursing care and expectations
Management don't encourage employees to take PTO. Vacation requests hard to be approve by management
Management, lack of resources at night
The most for-profit feeling non-profit hospital in existence.
Short-staffed, was constantly floated to other units, sometimes I was the only PCT on the floor with 15+ patients.
working lunches with time monitored; heavy inbound calls from 'providers' who struggle to communicate issues; very heavy micromanagement when a mistake is made; no upward opportunities unless you are willing to engage in toxic work culture. working 10 hour shifts with no lunches; being told you are 'given' 15 minutes for lunch without any chance to properly recover after difficult phone calls.
Like most of healthcare, very bureaucratic Senior leaders too in the weeds
Overworked, underpaid, gossip and drama
Horrible communication, doesn’t really care about employees. Don’t really get incentives

Good pay and personal benefits
The money was good in my opinion. I got a $10k increase three years in a row without being promoted and I got several bonuses. They sent me to Europe for my first time, almost all expenses paid for a year. They even provided free flights for family to come visit me. I couldn’t believe that I had such an amazing opportunity only a year out of college. I was given a lot of responsibility and I was in rooms with board members, executives, and even the CEO. I gained a lot of experience developed several skills.
I guess they pay for just starting was ok
Clean layout, the store was tidy. Uniform was also very clean and neat. Learned a lot about working inf a grocery store.
Offered upward growth if you put in the effort, was able to get to a senior position after two years with minimal previous experience, and significant pay raises; The people on a personal level were great to work with and all were in it together; Could get in your groove and find a routine for the calmer months
Good salary and benefits not too bad. Remote
Okay pay Great benefits Decent if a little intensive work, sets you up for success Good pathways to upper management
Made some great friends there.
The company has great pay and stellar benefits. They even have a benefit for IVF. They offer 6 months of job-protected parental leave, and if you've been there over a year and are a birth parent you get 100% of pay for 8 weeks plus your short-term disability.
Great workplace, coworkers are like family, they promote within the store.
Autonomy within role. Remote/Hybrid Flexibility. Decent Benefits. Decent Pay (depending on the role). Company car (depending on the role). In my 4 years with the organization I can say I personally recruited some of the best talent I’ve seen.
Great benefits and starting pay. 50 cent pay increase each year you stay.

The work is fulfilling and interesting if you like working in analytics and data analysis. You learn a lot of valuable skills working here through the day to day operations. The company is on the younger side in terms of age and it’s evident in the environment.
Most supervisors are very active, the others don't last

","Challenges to being a new retailer in the US
No cons come to mind
They favor Europeans over Americans and non- minorities over minorities. They constantly brought over people from Europe to do jobs that I feel should have gone to existing or new US employees. The work life balance at the corporate office is non existent. Then when people quit they will add their workload to yours despite the fact that you are already working 60+ hours per week. Theh have no clue what their strategy is and keep changing directions which requires the same work to be done over and over again. The deadlines are completely unrealistic and management is a revolving door of Europeans who don’t know the US market and insist on implementing European standards in the US. It really disappoints me that it turned out how it did.
the hours and shift was insane and they couldn't keep a schedule solid. they were constantly changing employees shifts after they left for the day. I had a constant shift of 2pm-11pm but wouldn't leave til close to 2am and there were nights like that I would leave and go home but they would change my shift so I would have to come right back like 5:30am and work til 1:30 and the only response is I should have looked at the schedule before I left even tho the schedule wasn't touched the whole week prior. within one year of workin there before I quit I somehow managed to build up almost 130 hours of PTO due to working crazy shifts non stops with hardly ever days off.
Lots of food waste.. could be donated but choose not to. No hours, part time, you really only pick up shifts. Made only 20 hours a week.
Very shaky company outlook following restructuring and changing direction from CEO and senior leadership; Always focused on trying to change and implement changes so rapidly, no one ever thought if it was a good idea to make these changes; Working on weekends (not every weekend, but probably once every 8-10 weeks), no one ever mentioned it during interviews because they knew people would run; Hours became very long (around ten hours) and would be crazy at stretches were lunch breaks were just not possible; Work would be very taxing to the point where you were doing work and just knew it wouldn't matter in a few days when you need to go in an opposite reaction
I left because: Unrealistic expectations for the workload placed on employees, with way more criticism than praise. Toxic work environment that will never change because management needs retraining. When you voice your concerns about the toxic work environment, you are met with retaliation. Employees get burnt out trying to get all the work done in 8 hrs a day. Even if you’re doing extra work because someone is out, on PTO. Micromanagement- you have to report your every move. Recently I’m told everyone has to fill out a daily tracker of everything they do each day. The work and the pressure cause you to make mistakes and then get into even more trouble. Employees have been working off the clock to get work done. Please do not enter! Health Risk!!!
Long hours on your feet Lots of heavy lifting and reaching for overstacked pallets Pay bumps could be a bit more significant
Everything. Bad management. Scheduling a mess.
Fortunately, I had a manager that would protect their team but the company is very unorganized. They implement and change policy on a whim and expect everyone to fall in line immediately and execute all the changes to perfection. The demand is extremely high. There is no work-life balance. You have to be EXTREMELY detail oriented because people will use what you say in emails against you. It's best to just copy and paste from the policy to provide people with answers. You just never know who is going to through you under the bus and for what. Even if it has nothing to do with you.
Can't really thing of any downsides
Inconsistent compensation structure. Very limited to non existent performance based incentives. Total rewards… far from it. Internationally bound structure/framework which creates significant hurdles and delays in operations and IT. European leadership very intolerant of acclimating and understanding the US employee. Biases at interview stage are real. Very cliquish environment. Lack of respect for employee relations therefor enabling retaliation.
Depending how busy your location is you may not get many hours.
Worst place I've ever worked. I would rather die than work there again
Not many employees are working at the same time, so you're expected to work hard to complete tasks and goals which might be a lot for some people.
poor adming/store relations, horrible logistics issues, incomprehensible expectations for productivity, expects all staff to follow the ""lidl"" way but doesn't provide leniency or support when logistics fails or if admin issues a massive ""stop everything and fix"" order. IT is constantly having issues and needs constant babying. company focuses deeply on pack out but does not care about the back end systems to make pack out more efficient. Scheduling is garbage and there is very minimal quality of life during push seasons. Think working 11-8 then having to come in the next day at 5-2 and having a commute time of more than an hour one way.
Company is still growing in US, some stores shutting down. Strict productivity goals means consistent stress
work schedule can be too much sometimes
Mixed messages of what corporate strategy is depending on who you talk to. Big plans to grow and then lay off 20% of workforce.
No consistency in strategy - change several times per year, High turnover at all levels, including leadership.
Good experience nice stuffs and benefits
Unrealistic expectations for the workload placed on employees, with way more criticism than praise. Toxic work environment that will never change because management is a big part of the rumor mill. When you voice your concerns about the toxic work environment, you are met with retaliation. Employees get burnt out, having to do the job of multiple people because of hours being cut to make bonuses for the higher-ups fatter.
You have to learn how to do everything in the store
It is completely disorganized. No one seems to know what they are doing. Decisions are not made based on data.
Extremely strict time clocking. Bad upper management.
It’s retail and the stresses can be real if people want their currently baking baked goods
Wawi is the new poor erp system
Lots of work, body strain
Managers do not take accountability for actions Lack of communication No sense of time management Unprofessional management Overworked Inconsistent scheduling Unorganized management
No guarantee for hours sometimes
It is completely disorganized. No one seems to know what they are doing. Decisions are not made based on data.
I only wish that the company regulations were more easy to access and understand, such as age requirement for certain supervising positions.
A lot of stores in the Metro have too much drama going on.
Extremely strict time clocking. Bad upper management.
Bad management, not receptive to new ideas
Lots of work, body strain
Managers do not take accountability for actions Lack of communication No sense of time management Unprofessional management Overworked Inconsistent scheduling Unorganized management
Hours can be crazy for managers
- Always UNDERSTAFFED because they want to be as efficient as possible - TOO MUCH WORK AND NOT ENOUGH COMPENSATION (you are not allowed to sit down or even just stand, you HAVE TO BE DOING SOMETHING AT ALL TIMES unless it's your break, your supervisors will remind you of this) - REALLY BAD WORK-LIFE BALANCE (you will be so exhausted after a shift that getting classwork done will be hard, they will also not be happy if you take any sick days or have to leave early) - Rotate workers too much, they will SIMPLY OVERWORK/EXPLOIT YOU UNTIL YOU LEAVE
Physically demanding at times, lots of walking, lifting. Wait for authorization at register.
Leadership is very poor. Has tons of Europeans at the top of the chain and they do not know how to adapt to the US markets. They also do not like to promote within the company, at least with U.S. colleagues. they prefer to bring over someone in Europe to fill manager positions rather than promote within the U.S. It is also very political when it comes to promotions and that is evident with who gets promoted and how quickly that is done. Leadership is also allergic to change. They refuse to change the processes and Operations differently then the European models and the company suffers.
Associates have to be carried if you're capable, I suggest not being capable
HQ ""leadership"" is a puppet role and does not involve any actual leading. But how can it? None of them know a single thing about retail in the US. Management positions are reserved for incompetent, insecure, Yes Men (gender neutral) to serve as overseers and personal bullies for the lower level employees. Despite using more company time (pointless meetings) and resources (sizable salary), they do the least amount of work, if any. It always a was a running joke/genuine question to ask ""what does [name] even do?"" Everybody spends all their time working on/talking about/revising/reviewing/documenting The Process instead of doing acutal work. You would think from the amount of time spent on it that the stores sell processes. Sadly, if they did, they would still be as low quality as their products.
I only wish that the company regulations were more easy to access and understand, such as age requirement for certain supervising positions.
A lot of stores in the Metro have too much drama going on.
Bad management, not receptive to new ideas
The expectation will always remain unattainable while they are unable to hold base level employees. Management will always be expected to hit their goals, in addition to filling the role of baker cashier stocker freshness and ordering. The list is insurmountable of what remains to be done by the end of the shift. Do not ever expect to leave at a certain time/ have a healthy work life balance
Hours can be crazy for managers
Physically demanding at times, lots of walking, lifting. Wait for authorization at register.
busy. hours. ui. iio. nju.
Constant change of leadership and inconsistency in standards
Upper management was horrendous to work with and talk to. Company policy and procedures changed every day. Store manager would also contact us on days off.
Alot of work, No slack offs
Awful Management No Room For Job Growth
Workload Office politics Constantly changing direction Work life balance Job security
The managers can micromanage you sometimes which can lead to stressful days.
Without professional experience, perhaps you won’t notice the disorder.
Can be longer hours, can be tough turnover
Job is very physically and mentally demanding. They will cut hours making it stressful on the small team left to run the store while still maintaining Lidl standards. Not much praise and recognition. DM is not understanding or approachable.
Leadership is at times disconnected and does not acknowledge dedication, hard work or appreciation / It can be difficult to bring forth change / Too many manual processes.
Management shows favoritism, Unorganized, no regard for personal life, poor scheduling ability
Changing expectations with little communication
A lot of pressure on one person and often did work alone when others were able to work as a team
- Managers have no clues about training - Incompetent management - Promises Big, but can't meet - All the management people are crazy - No proper training schedule - Send people from location to location to learn without any directions - Make work from the first day without knowing anything about the company
no work-life balance. all employees are overwhelmed. management only sees failures
Unethical business tactics, sudden unfair hours cuts, poorly structured, hard on good workers
There were a lot of issues with management.
Work/life balance needs to be forced, mass layoff
Senior managers have no single strategy.
Gotta be very motivated and willing to give it all to be successful.
Long shifts with little breaks
A lot of work expectations

Waiting for new store to open
Lets start from the top down.... All high level management is brought in from Europe and has little to no respect for Americans All DM's are extremely young, very inexperienced and only people of color or female. Store level is similar in the pecking order. You have store managers that generally are young and inexperienced. Many many Assistant Manager and Supervisors have much more experience than the store managers. Unrealistic expectations for everyone at store level. If a store doesn't meet their numbers, then their budget for staff is cut which means that the store that wasn't doing well starts to do worse. It gets to the point that you have so little validation for your hard work you have to set personal goals for yourself because the ones given to from above are unrealistic. I do have to say I loved my associates, we were a great team and in it together. That all being said, don't work here. There are other places that pay similar wages that have better work life balance, less hostile work environment and better management. And as a plus, if you work else ware you don't yelled at in German.
Hours, short staffed, on your feet
Very poor leadership and a total lack of direction and consistency from management. District managers lack the experience, knowledge and leadership skills needed for their position. There seems to be different standards depending on your age, position and skill set. Lack of vision, consistency, leadership, and above all else communication. They brag about and even sell potential employees on this so called great work life balance. That's a bait and switch if I ever saw one.
Management Hours Pay rate Employee of the Month was always bias.
The hours could be better
Classes, tasks, management, customers, hours
A typical day at work involves running on a tight schedule like a robot. No moment is wasted. What I mean by this, is that even if you are standing at a cash register, if there is nobody in the line, you can't stand there. You must unpack a pallet nearby while keeping an eye on the till and the self check area. You are exposed to extreme cold The shoes are akin to something from the Spanish Inquisition. You will go home with severe physical pain even if you are young and in shape. You are doing heavy lifting, pulling, and pushing around the clock. You will be mistreated while you do it. The management is worse than incompetent. They are just bad people. The workplace culture is sociopathic. The worst things about this job, are not the tasks, but the management and culture while you work your behind off. No there is no employee discount and no you will not have an hour lunch break, they get out of that by making you take two 15 minute breaks instead. Only enough time to stare at your phone, not time for a human being to have a reasonable segment of time to recharge at an abusive job. Do not work here. The wage they offer serves only to prey on the poor and the young.
Long hours Doing things multiple times Working hard and brining results is not enough
Some managers are horrible. Nepotism present.
the breaks were kind of short
The workload is ridiculous, don't pay enough for the job responsibilities. Depending on which department you work for, there is no growth potential.
Since lidl is a German based company, their business model is catered more towards Europe. It isn’t horrible by any means but at the same time, doesn’t translate well to the USA. They have very high expectations and short time windows to get the work done. My previous store was plagued with a weak manager, a pest problem, and the number of supervisors outweighed associates. With that in mind this makes our workday extremely more stressful and creates a huge issue of the store falling to the wayside. Corporate is also not very strong in listening and mitigating issues before they get out of hand
Rude managers and supervisors with huge egos.
Lots of physical work in cold temperatures Lots of coworker drama
Gets boring and repetitive fast, not much room to show improvement and move up
late shifts heavy lifting uncomfy uniforms
Lets start from the top down.... All high level management is brought in from Europe and has little to no respect for Americans All DM's are extremely young, very inexperienced and only people of color or female. Store level is similar in the pecking order. You have store managers that generally are young and inexperienced. Many many Assistant Manager and Supervisors have much more experience than the store managers. Unrealistic expectations for everyone at store level. If a store doesn't meet their numbers, then their budget for staff is cut which means that the store that wasn't doing well starts to do worse. It gets to the point that you have so little validation for your hard work you have to set personal goals for yourself because the ones given to from above are unrealistic. I do have to say I loved my associates, we were a great team and in it together. That all being said, don't work here. There are other places that pay similar wages that have better work life balance, less hostile work environment and better management. And as a plus, if you work else ware you don't yelled at in German.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/bp-Reviews-E9011.htm,"Pay is very good. Benefits are very good.
Good benefits, decent salary, reliable income and longevity/retirable employer if you are content with just making a paycheck
Executing a clear strategy aligned to the energy transition
bp has been nothing short of an amazing place to work for me. The people, the global exposure, career opportunities, training, benefits are all top notch. bp makes a point to really immerse all employees into the culture and buy into our ambition of Net Zero by 2050 or sooner. Leadership is diverse and very accessible; the kindest people I have come across in my years of working. I honestly hope to retire at bp and don't want to work anywhere else!
Benefits package is decent - medical/dental/vision, 401k + match, paid vacation and sick time, medium base salary compared to other major Oil and Gas companies, pension (if hired before certain dates and grandfathered in, however beware of ongoing pensioner issues and company betraying its ex-employees who built the company up years ago).
Great learning tool growing my up
Training, good benefits, potential growth
Transforming itself from a traditional oil and gas company into an integrated energy company. The change is exciting and offering cool opportunities in renewable growth areas.
Worked with my hours while I was in college
Awesome, great, chill, lovely, care
Really good benefits,fast paced workplace
Great benefits with good vacation
- Great company culture, huge emphasis on care for others due to fatalities and accidents that could unfortunately occur at work sites - Great opportunity to learn, grow, network, and learn the energy industry - Forward thinking company due to European management not American, focused on being ahead of the curve for renewables - Pay is extremely good for new hires, especially in IT department - Flatish hierarchy, actual executives are open to feedback from junior employees and will actually listen, are definitely the type to sit down with you for a coffee if they have time with the exception of EVPs and CEO - Manageable office politics, healthy amount even but your mileage may vary depending on group, office location, role, and which part of the business you're in - YMMV again but people I've worked with have been spectacular, no egos, only focus on getting tasks done and celebrating small victories. No finger pointing or blaming others. People take ownership and responsibility - CEO always repeats himself so there's never a miscommunication/misunderstanding about his plans, agenda, or overall strategy for the company
Good pay and benefits. Opportunities for training and to become an expert
Great place to work! Flexible working arrangements!
The Benefits are really great
Hard work. Great pay. Different people. From all over

","Lots of internal negotiations. Company politics exist with all big companies.
Few opportunities for advancement, assigned to a role with wrong fit after reorganization, poor work life balance due to too many lay offs and not keeping critical people (this is a safety issue in several ways), work location changed for no good reason, manager did not listen to above concerns which led me to look for a new job, ghosted during last week of work despite always having good ratings for entire time at the job (network and email access deactivated prematurely, exit interview not conducted by HR), unnecessary micro management, felt forced out despite them acting surprised when I left
Need to continue to showcase our great people and operational wins
For those based in the US, a bit of chatter around more roles going to the UK or being outsourced. That being said, with the investment bp has made into US projects, I am confident we'll continue to have a strong US employee base (still our largest employee base).
Bad pension scheme for those who didn't roll it out when leaving the company. Empty slogans and company values that are no longer principles by which the company operates. Diversity and inclusion before merit-based placement resulting in team productivity suffering. No longer a ""speak up"" safe culture. Severed too many employees, leaving current staff overworked and understaffed and undervalued.
I worked part time, lots of hours
Lost in organization, hard to go up the chain
Proper workforce planning. Can be a bit chaotic.
Management was horrible with listening to worker's problems.
not many cant think of
Very corporate, change is slow
A lot of work and bad management
- No room for long term growth or promotions, many people stuck in their roles for years, especially true for those working in P&O side where people are stuck as engineers for 10-15 years before getting opportunity to move up to management positions. Less wait time for IT (I&E) or trading side (T&S), but still all leadership roles are filled and won't vacate for a long time - IT upper management are deluded into trying to turn an Oil and Gas company into a tech company. Nothing wrong with pushing for better standards and increasing digital capability, but having leetcode style interviews and exams that don't test skills actually used on the job is just very dumb and a huge waste of resources - Highly disorganized and very chaotic at times when it comes to getting administrative action done (this is negated by whole org being understanding and working to resolve issue) - Company touts ethics but energy is a dirty business wrought with geopolitics. You can't claim to be a moral and ethical company yet does business with anti Western governments. Should just accept that we are here to make money by providing the world with the energy it needs and are playing in a very complex geopolitical game where there is no black and white.
BP does not value and promote Americans like they do British people, particularly to middle and senior management. They tend to be command and control which contributes to safety issues. Also, management sweeps issues under the rug.
Schedule will be full of morning meetings that overlap with UK afternoon
He works 70 to 80 hours a week and get paid $15 an hour wow new hires are getting paid $1, 4.50 an hour to start
Another if hours very little sleep
Moving up is highly political, which creates a bit of a toxic environment. Relationships mean more than competence which results in questionable decision making which can make your life miserable as an employee. If you're early in your career and are focused on learning & development as well as career trajectory, I would go elsewhere.
Leadership is lost and waiting on London for everything.
They are a very large corporation which sometimes makes it a challenge to get things done.
None at petrobel so much for understanding
Every 2-3 years there is a big re-org, never really feel settled in a role for too long.
Shared space with other establishments which means their managers can be rude to you and there's nothing you can do about it.
Lots of Outsourcing going on, Management is hit or miss
Always undergoing downsizing in the USA
Bureaucracy x 10 Frequent flux in the management approach of IT resources; you must be able to adapt to change and wait out the changes that don't work but take time to rollback.
Refining environment is difficult if you have commitments outside of work. Your job is to keep the place running.

Management is not trained at all
Burcratic culture, Ineffeciency, process oriented
Too many reorgs during past 10 years, which laid off hard working employees
Since 2021, the organization is flatter than it used to be, so upward advancement is harder thank it used to be. There are still plenty of horizontal and semi-horizontal moves to be had, so you won't get bored.
devalue quality of US workers
Hit hard at beginning of Covid, and lots of great folks got laid off.
Depending on the role work life balance could be an issue
Pay lower than used to be on average
Office politics often lead to unnecessary drama
As with any large corporation, the need to go through multiple hoops (or approvals) to get something done would slow things down.
Difficult to grow through grades. Not experience based candidate selection. Difficult to grow through grades. Annoying interviews. Difficult to grow through grades.

Not many cons besides just the work you get thrown into as a software engineer
Upward mobility get more and more limited as you progress, unless you are willing to live in UK. This would mean going on UK employment terms which will be quite a lot less. Company becoming increasingly more British - they don’t like American workers. Strangely though they don’t have any problems taking the money generated in America. Go figure. If you are not white/ Caucasian - forget about it. You have almost zero chances of being senior in bp. Only a chosen few minorities are given the opportunity to progress. Mainly for the cosmetics. The vast vast majority of other minorities will languish. BP does not care about ethnic diversity- starting from the main BP board, to the CEO, and down to other executives.
The average 10 year of the employees is long, and the average age is high

Customers can get very obnoxious
Nothing to mention just waw
Lack of transparency, incompetent leaders
None that I can think of
everything runs out of the UK
Sometimes long hours, and varying schedule
Some coworkers was terrible and very weired.
Rigid pay structures, if you get low balled, you are stuck in that pay cycle
Poor career development and growth opportunities. Arbitrary criteria for promotion and no point in providing feedback as leadership doesn’t care and neither does HR.

ADO boards are redundant and make you enter the same info in three different software platforms.
Poor pay, mean customers and mean managers
Did not like working weekends and holidays
My experience during my time with this company was that you get ahead by who you're related to and not your technical ability or work ethic. I was used as a scapegoat on multiple occasions by senior leadership for things I had zero involvement in and was punished by speaking out about it.
- limited mobility - pay under market
Bureaucracy, size of company can keep from moving and feels overwhelming.
Volatile industry with frequent payoffs
Low pay not much room for moving up
Not so much about the salary
Customers can sometimes be rude

Less chances of moving up, pay
The main challenges are working through barriers to execute work. It takes a good deal of time to become familiar with communication paths and work streams.

After a year at the company, they’ll pay for SANS training which is great. If you’re new to security, put your year in, get your cert, then run. The current manager of Security knows his stuff. The current senior manager of Networking/systems knows his stuff. Not a terrible place to work in IT if you like slow environments with red tape. Stock is pretty consistent, but you’ll never get any unless you’re a manager or choose to invest your 401k in it.
Most of my co-workers are willing to work alongside (pull their fair share) without having to be prodded very often.
It depends on who your GM is. If you have a good GM, you will have a great experience and truly enjoy the job. It is hard work and sometimes frustrating, but it's a lot of fun having access to multiple businesses and helping them get what they need.
Flexible hours and decent pay
Closed holidays ( only full time employees get paid - part timers no pay ). Not much else positive
Well run, decentralized, constant opportunity for growth if motivated
Small branch had easy connections to bigger branches
Saturdays and Sundays off There are no other pros except for the people and companies shopping. Certainly no pros in management!
Take care of their employees Never lay people off
The general manager is one of the most understanding and caring bosses I have ever had. He did a great job connecting with me and I actually wanted to work hard for him.
Good place to work at
Some of the employees are intelligent. Some of the employees are kind, professional and understand being a team. On employee appreciation days instead of getting the +$14 per hour raise you needed to be able to afford normal things they provide hot dogs, hamburgers and corn syrup drinks.
There's something about the Fastenal Culture that pulls you in. It's like family. There is an open-door policy that allows ANYONE to share their ideas. It makes you feel like you are contributing to something other than just the bottom line. There are opportunities for advancement all the time. Fastenal prides itself on hiring from within. And there are a lot of opportunities for learning and advancement. The work is very rewarding and the people are irreplaceable.
Upward mobility is available and encourage.

Fastenal is adapting, albeit slowly, to the new reality of WFH as a common aspect of work where positions allow for it. Also, for the Sourcing and the Quoting/Bidding teams, the company is realigning to better serve its customers in both the focus of its workgroups and the structure & procedures to better enable quick turnaround of tasks.
The marketing team was the best to work with as a group
Hands On Fast Paced Autonomy
The general manager was great working with my busy college schedule and brought a fun work environment.
","Tedious and limited job opportunities in the same branch after graduation. Pay is confusing for those job opportunities also.
Fastenal, across all lanes of IT, pays in like the 20th percentile at BEST. Somehow they keep getting away with criminally underpaying everyone and it is truly amazing. Asking for raises will typically end up in gaslighting. Sloooow to progress. Way behind market trends. Time off? Ha you wish. Worst benefits ever. Old school management has zero clue how to manage remote workers. Zero diversity in senior leadership last I saw. It shows.
To many changes as of late
You may potentially be exposed to harmful chemicals depending on what businesses your branch has. Pay is not great considering how much physical labor you do as a supply chain associate. The software is completely out of date and hard to use at first. Their are many loopholes within the software, takes a good amount of time to learn and get used to.
Can sometimes be stressful and have a lot in your plate but you’re out and about.
Like pulling teeth to get a full time position if you are over 30 years old. No benefits for part time, and if you are over 30 , you will stay part time forever. Management are primarily white, males who look down on everyone. POC are never elevated to management positions, and are rarely seen anyway. Lower management is chosen only if they are young, regardless if they have people skills. Constant turnover due to manager's inflated egos. Their favorite phrase that they throw at you constantly is ""Everyone is replaceable"", yet they are always hiring and complaining they cannot fill positions lol. It's pretty bad when they advertise externally for Asst. Manager and Lead positions, because the existing employees are either too old to be considered, or the kids do not have work ethic to do the work necessary. The smart employees usually end up leaving, usually without notice due to the high stress level and toxic atmosphere.
Must be diligent to grow
Drive hour and half for interview No emphasis on part time employees Out dated trainings
Poor management did just what was necessary. Failure to look for new business, no follow up on any ideas suggested They force you to quit and claim there are no layoffs which is not correct. PALEH closed June 1, 2023 3 support staff looking for work out of job at Fastenal.
Pay structure could be better
The workload to man hours was horribly unbalanced for multiple reasons and this caused me to not be able to see a task through without being interrupted and needing to complete another task first. A never ending mountain of work that seemed to stack higher with each passing day, the pressure can get to you if you take those emotions home. This was over a year ago that I left the company, and it they appeared to have expanded their team since then.
Unorganized at busy times in day
They hate their employees. You’re very expected to have a weak slave mindset by the employer and management. It’s showing obvious signs of possibly going out of business. Nepotism is a problem. If you don’t have experience doing exactly that position, they consider it having no work experience and start you off at the lowest rate. Experience and ability are not valued here literally at all. High school cashier wages, you will be unable to pay basic bills off of this job. It’s unaffordable working here, everyone here has other jobs, a spouse with a real job, live with family or roommates, some possibly homeless and tons of employees can’t afford a vehicle. Foolishly, they require degrees for common sense basic office and business positions. 95% of the positions are part time so no benefits but you’re expected to spend over half a weeks wages to get a dr’s note if you’re sick or they don’t allow you to come back to work. If you get sick plan to get a different job? If you do get a full time position the benefits are horrible and you’ll work every weekend. Report an obvious hazard like a wrapped pallet leaning at least two feet over the pallets edge 30 ft up and it’s never corrected, it’ll stay like that the rest of the day. Some of the things you handle are toxic so wash up good; they’ll say carcinogen warning etc. The work environment is hazardous, there’s definitely accidents whether someone is hurt or not, nowhere near enough pay for that. Some of your coworkers have very strong bo, cologne, perfume, and deodorant. It will literally gag you sometimes. This clearly creates a very awkward and unprofessional situation. They will have an undiscerning inaccurately assumptive supervisor/lead do your evaluation insulting your intelligence with grading on things like your ‘ability to learn’ which is never tested. They basically pretend because they are incompetent that you are equally inept and therefore must operate and think like they do. If you’re already experienced in forklift, managing etc, it’s bad for them to be aware of that. Don’t tell them about prior experience. When being trained on something new, the individual training you may likely be easily confused, not understand your questions, be unable to see well or obviously inaccurately guessing at things happening right in front of them, acting like you’re doing things you aren’t or things are happening with tools or items that aren’t happening; it’s really strange, possibly narcotics. Also continuing assuming you’re not understanding very simple things out of nowhere. Try to be patient and not to correct them. In general it’s apparent most can’t read people here. If reprobate coworkers feel you don’t have enough melanin or whatever their delusion is you’ll be targeted and complained about true or not, childish faces, comments, attitudes, uncooperative, unprofessional etc. Delusion and underdeveloped character is tolerated for some, even clear sexism and racism. Though most everyone are doing so, make sure you don’t press a mouse or keyboard harder than the mentally unstable degenerate next to you feels you should, don’t drop anything, etc. they’ll lie claiming a sound in a very noisy warehouse is disrupting their work, if you do it. The saturation of ignorance, weakness and compromise here is impressive. Also looks like there’s gender specific positions for some departments or positions. I’ve worked the same exact hours and my paycheck magically varied at least $150 less at times. They short your already tiny checks. The computers, os, printers, scan guns, conveyor belt, and likely anything else you’re using will mess up consistently effecting your work pace. The lag on the computer at times is greater than multiple minutes, you’ll suddenly have multiple windows open from 8 plus minutes prior when you’re trying to open a file, etc. You’re expected to keep a purposely unrealistic average pace of 40+ jobs per hour with no mistakes to be eligible for your .50¢ slap in the face raise every year. Only a few people can meet the quota and not regularly besides one person so clearly no raises happening here but even if they gave mandatory $4 raises every six months it’s going to be multiple years till you’re at an affordable wage to be able to pay everything adults have to pay for. If you meet the quota for the entire month they give $300 extra for the month..that’s not an incentive to work at a robot pace. They’re getting what they’re paying for; unprofessional rapid turnover, many incompetent workers, most don’t care about their high school wage job. Inaccurately assumptive and ill-equipped managers as well, very unorganized business overall. Play stupid games with your business and employees, win well deserved stupid prizes.
You may find pay and benefits better elsewhere, but the flexibility and open door policy is something you will rarely find elsewhere.
Potentially difficult work for medium pay.
It’s a warehouse so it’s hard keeping a consistent team therefore the work falls on the reliable few
Heavy work. They'll start you Sunday-Thurs but after a couple of months move you to Saturday off and a weekday off. Part-time only, difficult to get full time.
Low income and long work week
Resources are there for growth, but you have to take the initiative to seek them out.
Need to consider better pay
Need to consider better pay
Health insurance is the worst plan at blue cross blue shield - BCBS rep confirmed. No eye insurance, it’s looped in with health insurance so if you wear contacts/glasses - no allowance. No short term disability, very small life insurance included with no option to pay extra for more. Low pay. Extremely cheap - no napkins, plastic ware, plates/forks, stir sticks, etc or even tissue boxes are available. Company says they’re environmentally conscious yet very bright lights are kept on constantly and cause eye issues for several employees.
None none none none none
The pay isnt the best
Difficult to take days off
Management is less than idea.
The pay is not enough for what you are expected to achieve which leads to long hours.
Not enough pay/ part time hours are not enough
Not a liveable wage even with pay bumps. 90% of positions are part time with no option for full time. The desired quota is unreachable most days even if you put in all your effort. No benefits for part-time. No pay on Holidays you have off.
Upper management is somewhat clueless as to the struggles the satellite Fastenal stores go through. They do not pay nearly enough for people with loads of experience (myself) or those that want to improve processes and procedures to help with the issues upper management seems unable to handle. I would've worked there for a long time if they would've paid me a living wage.
Hub mistakes Could have a better communication tool between departments
Do not work here if you are looking to advance or start your career. Management, depending on the branch, can make your break how you view the company as a whole. Unfortunately I was one of the unlucky ones with a manger that didn't contribute to the sales or backend of running the facility. low or no advancement at small branch stores Monthly Sales goals are almost unattainable. ever increasing, especially when upper management re-assigns key accounts to other branches.
Poor management in New Jersey, Poor pay if you don't live in the midwest or south where things are cheaper
Low pay and you can't get anything quickly enough
Big company, easy to get lost in the crowd if you don’t stand out.
Executives don't let pay increase for positions below them
The old management was a mess. The new GM will definitely make it a better work place and give more appreciation and structure.
The pay could be better.
Not supported well by Leadership. The role struggles to be effective because the Leadership team doesn't set proper expectations of the stores to follow recommendations as set by the RFM's.
Limited Remote Work. Very lean.
The pay isnt the best
Difficult to take days off
Management is less than idea.
Little to no training and a high probability of burn out.
Too many to even get started.
Average to low pay Cheap company Lousy, selfish upper management
The pay is not enough for what you are expected to achieve which leads to long hours.
Not enough pay/ part time hours are not enough
I’m sure it varies by location but for my branch management does very little to actually manage causing sone coworkers to form an inflated sense of authority
Tedious and limited job opportunities in the same branch after graduation. Pay is confusing for those job opportunities also.
Hub mistakes Could have a better communication tool between departments
The training was very hard to follow and they kind of throw you to the wolves
Training upon being hired was insufficient for learning how to use any software or getting familiar with the data. Minimal opportunity to work from home despite all communication being held virtually. The downtown location, while pretty, is too overstimulating of a work environment
Tell lies, Boring, Favoritism, Mostly part time positions , cheap company, part timers do more work than full timers, and not compensated. Same starting pay for all potions. Strange atmosphere
Big company, easy to get lost in the crowd if you don’t stand out.
Hard work, lifting heavy boxes. Environment can be dusty.
Heavy emphasis on sales, company is VERY frugal.
The pay could be better.
Limited Remote Work. Very lean.
Everything else is a con you get paid bad and management is dumb
Dirty Low atmosphere Not my interest
Depending on what department your in, you have a different experience. Some departments are more flexible than others. Are departments aren't equal. Hate getting paid 1st and 15th of the month. Its tough going into a weekend without a paycheck sometimes. No raises, unless you get promoted No path for professional development/growth. They don't do quarterly reviews and annual seemed informal/optional.
Pay is a little low
You are overworked and underpaid. They have you managing and delivering inventory rather than performing the essential jobs of a sales representative. Fastenal is a stable environment.
SOPs are not consistent company wide- too much emphasis on ""innovation"" as a core value at entry level
Base pay isn't always ideal
Small teams place high expectations on individuals. Far too much product knowledge required, sprinkled with levels of construction knowledge as well (constraints, tolerances, structural integrity, etc.) Expectations are far too high for the salary levels offered. Constant strain for financial growth overshadows all aspects, even when achieving goals or setting sales records.
Little to no training and a high probability of burn out.
Too many to even get started.
Average to low pay Cheap company Lousy, selfish upper management
Lack of communication lack of training at times
Compensation is very top heavy and based on profits and growth. When I started getting bonus our store was doing about 150k per month and I was getting almost $1k a month in commission. By the end and what made me leave we were doing about 500k and my bonus fell to the minimum of $125. Most of this was do to minimum bonuses that were exhorbadent and well above the companies corporate pay structure which ate up our profit growth causing me to get paid less.
Pay Commission structure Hours Small branches
On multiple occasions would be told “you need to be out selling AT LEAST 80% of the time” and then send an email about needing full SOP descriptions, routes, zone, and potential new clients. Can’t really take care of that while on the road. Fully responsible for your own collections.
Work time management flow away
Achieving goals can be hard
Long hours takes a month to start making decent money
Low pay and sometimes it’s slow
Benefits and salary are lacking compared to other companies. Although they are very profitable, they are extremely lean and hesitant to spend money on their employees. No flex schedules or remote work options unless you have been traveling for multiple days at a time or hold very specific job titles.
n/a at this current time
n/a at this current time
Can get repetitive and boring sometimes. Labor induced but not too bad, just on your feet all the time which is typical for any machinist position.
Dirty Low atmosphere Not my interest
Pay is a little low
SOPs are not consistent company wide- too much emphasis on ""innovation"" as a core value at entry level
Base pay isn't always ideal
boring, coworkers are a little annoying
Lower end pay to start. Not drawing in top-notch workers.
very repetitive work can lack support
Lack of opportunity for advancement
Up and down pay and commission
Don’t get pay enough for the work you do. No matter how hard you work, manager will never notice it.
There are a lot of cons
Claim to hire within but outside of sales there aren't a lot of paths to furthering careers. Non-Sales wages are low for the industry
There isn't anything negative to mention
You get a lot on your plate for very little pay. It always felt like a boys club. More stressful due to other unorganized people in the org. The company only cares about the stores, so if you are working in the office, you can do the same thing somewhere else and get paid way more.
Fastenal continues to try to do things on the cheap. Internally, this is referred to as being ""Fastenal frugal"" and is seen as a virtue. However, when it comes to compensation packages, it can be an issue. There are positions and employees for which this is a good match; people do what they're paid for and are paid for what they do, and they're comfortable with that as they go home, pay their bills, live their lives and don't make much effort to go above and beyond. But for those who do go above & beyond, who take particular pride in what they do and drive innovation in their roles and loyalty in their customers, there can be a feeling of being undervalued.
Little variety in the day to day work, never received a raise over 2 years of solid work
No Year End Bonus At the time, somewhat outdated tech
The Christmas ""bonus"" is a joke.

Opportunities for growth Salary is competitive and negotiable company-funded career development Great leadership
Strong I&D initiatives Good benefits -- In recent years, WHR has expanded paternity/care-giver leave, fertility treatments, legal service offerings, etc. Investing strongly in the Benton Harbor / St. Joseph community Generally very high integrity & moral standards Exciting opportunities to work with global teams and on global products
Company leadership pushes health and wellness initiatives to its employees. Flex Fridays and a flexible work arrangement to flex around family and health obligations is very competitive.
I've been fortunate to spend most of my career here and while there have been many ups and downs, I've always had an opportunity to continue to learn, grow and develop. I've not only worked for great leaders but also with wonderful people who challenge and support each other. There is a strong spirit of winning that continues to pervade our organization.
Embarking on a career in manufacturing has proven to be incredibly fulfilling, and my time at Whirlpool's Tulsa division manufacturing facility stands as a testament to this. Whirlpool adeptly harnesses the essence of challenge and reward intrinsic to this field, presenting me with daily opportunities to overcome hurdles and reap the benefits of my efforts. I wholeheartedly endorse considering a role at Whirlpool if you seek a career path that promises both personal and professional gratification.
Great management and support. Great benefits.
Decent benefits if you do not have a long term illness or disability. 401k match
Spent over a decade with this great reputed company. All I can say is 1. Great Colleagues, with good supporting environment. 2. Work Life Balance.
very nice and long brooms
Great benefits, knowledgeable colleagues, friendly learning atmosphere, pathways for advancement
Vertically integrated factory with no shortage of projects to tackle.
Good pay, good benefits, and great EHS team. Plenty of work and continuous expansion.
People - Whirlpool has some of the best people you can work with. Everyone is open to working together to achieve a common goal, people have genuine respect/appreciation for each other and the people leaders do everything in their power to make individuals feel empowered and valued. Development Opportunity - Being a very flat organization, lower level leaders have direct exposure to senior leadership. This creates loads of opportunities to learn from those leaders and be part of the strategic conversation early in your career while also exciting the strategy. Whirlpool leaders are committed to individual development and there tools available for employees to continue to develop their career and reach their aspirational roles. Finance teams rotate every 2-3 years which creates a learning culture and bias for action.
Great Benefits Located in a Small Town with Low Cost of Living Tight Knit Community In and Out of the Office Onsite Childcare

Liked learning new things, Proud for working a cell and putting them in the green on performance and production.
Good company, good diversity and inclusion
Have been an excellent Jurney. 18 years in the same company and by the way this is my first Employee. I have been working in different roles and I am very glad to Whirlpool for all the knowledge that I've built. This is an excellent company to work really, the combination of Family - Work does not have a price.
Amazing people! Overall work environment is on the casual side

-great product, employees truly care about end consumer -work/family flexibility
Whirlpool's value system in terms of intense focus on the consumer drives our decision making everyday. The company motto, ""there is no right way to do a wrong thing"" rings true throughout the halls. Which aligns perfectly with my personal values and creates a culture of one team. The way we make decisions is very fact based, data driven which helps ground everyone on the problem we're solving and when we do this well we've proven we can drive breakthrough results.
Diversity & Inclusion. Whirlpool is a global company, so you will work with people from all over the world.
Stable employer with great potential for growth in a great small resort town along Lake Michigan

","There really are no cons to working at Whirlpool. I have worked here longer than any other company in my entire lengthy career. There's a reason that Whirlpool is ranked as one of the best large companies in the world to work for.
in certain organizations, upward mobility is limited (no -one wants to vacate their positions)
3 rounds of layoffs+voluntary retirement pkgs and attrition over the past 7 years has lead to bare bones teams and overburdened employees. Rampant collective exhaustion. Employee/project team recognition based strongly on your manager/leadership's initiative-- it is very inconsistent who gets recognized. Bonuses have strong correlation to business performance -- if you have a personal incredible year of work performance, your bonus could still be zero which is a tough pill to swallow when someone who performed similarly in a previous ""good year"" reaps HUGE rewards. Engineering takes a back seat to marketing. Diversity is a revolving door. Recruiting a lot of diverse talent (a pro), but a lot leave the company too, especially at higher levels of management.
Resources can become scarce depending on the quarter performance. Down sizing through attrition has created some vacuums of talent at some key technical positions.
Over the last several years, there have been many changes as we've weathered macro issues. Through that the company has made tough decisions. There is alot that is expected of individuals and at times, role requirements can be overwhelming so individuals need to continue to manage priorities so as not to get overwhelmed.
There really are not too many con's other than the need for more time to perform routine PM activities.
Short staffed, lots of hours
The environment can be very toxic at times, leading to the increased mental health issues in the corporate headquarters town of Saint Joseph & Benton Harbor. The employment door revolves out at an incredible rate and the company can not attract good workers. Last few executives hired in lasted less than 2 years
1. Average Health Benefits. 2. Less clarity on the upline move. 3. Low Pay compared to competitors and market.
early hours of work and great salary
Maybe a little too process oriented at times
The time spent on WCM is mostly a waste.
Work can be overwhelming and manpower is lacking for the amount of work. Corporate and North America Region doesn't seem to put much investment into EHS. Easily doing the work of 2 to 3 people which adds a lot of extra stress. This particular site has a mindset of ""That's how we've always done"" which leads to a lot of problems and extra work.
Company dosen't value people - The strange dynamic at Whirlpool is although it has some of the best workers and people leaders out there. The company sentiment is not positive in the community due to continual layoffs and time and time again it is proven that Whirlpool does not believe people are it's greatest asset. Benefits - Whirlpool's benefits although strong compared to other small firms in the area do not compete with any larger regional firms. The pay is slightly lower than other companies of the same size.
The location in my opinion is nice as a married man with kids but I have heard from younger single employees that dating, nightlife, ect. is lacking.
There aren't many cons here
Too many bosses ,not enough rotation. Not enough pay for work. No bonuses ,no incentives. No compassion for elderly employees. No employee meeting strategies. Doesn't get personal input from employees that actually run the plant and communicate with the workers to make it run better and not have so much waste material. Doesn't pay attention to people talking on phones and wasting a lot of time doing nothing when they could be working. To much favoritism to some
Hard to be promoted technically within same role
Nothing to say. Some leaders don't define Whirlpool.
Rigid with location, however, location isn't attractive to many so many continue to leave the organization. Great place for a family and kids, but lacking from a diversity perspective in the community.

Friday when I was stung by a bee. I had to go to the emergency room. highly allergic. after using my epi pen I let my boss know and left for the er. this morning, I logged in as normal and started a conversation with my boss about no point no pay. I was told that's what sick time is for. what happens when you get freaking covid at the start of the year and have to use all you sick time. so now I get punished for choosing my life over working. I thought whirlpool cared about there employees, what a lie. run away

Some managers are very demanding Once you start getting older they start pushing you out.

-very difficult to make leap upward- leaders can block your career moves -each category works differently- -Many times what the senior leadership says vs does are two different things -managers get squeezed too much- responsible for catching everything dropping from above and below -location- small town with not a lot going on
We have some of the strongest brands in the industry but at times don't support them in market / differentiate them as they should be, its our biggest unlock.
Living in South West Michigan might not be an ideal location for some.
none that I can think of
High turnover rate. Some areas have weak management
The people are the biggest con of Whirlpool. I never been in an environment that is so toxic in my life. So much middle management who just sit at home with no knowledge of the product, dumping work onto people till they quit and shipping jobs abroad for cheap. A toxic hell hole. Retention is nonexistent, and I would honestly have to say that people who enjoy the work are those who are sitting at home and do not have any direct experience on the ground. In my department all the women and young people ran away, while reducing the workforce, reducing benefits and lack of knowledge transfer. I would never recommend someone to work here even if it's your last and final offer. There is no investment in the people and the those who actually make the company run. Stay away!

Pay a little low for area, heavy reliance on metrics, frustrating pace of change, before you get to see if something is working they change it.
The mandatory weekends and over daily hours. To get them to work with you when life happens you have to know the numbers to call and the right person to talk to. Unless you are the right person be prepared to be on the line regardless of experience, expertise, and education!!! You will not move up unless the person in charge knows you, adores you, and us related to you. Don't ever date anyone from there because their actions; past and present, reflect on you!!
It is hard work. Standing 10+ hours a day. Fast paced. Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons.

Had to de-escalate calls from angry customers that are allowed to cuss at you because their expensive appliance stopped working shortly after buying it and they can not return. Management did not want you to contact them. I started with a group of 30 people and only 2 people stayed after 1 month of training. Calls are back to back and no breaks in between. You get two 10 minute breaks. You aren’t done with calls at 6:15 pm when you are scheduled. They stop calls at 6pm and there are hundreds left in the queue at 6pm that you have to stay late most nights until they are all cleared. I wouldn’t recommend anyone work for Whirlpool because you are the person the angry customers are taking all their frustration out on. I had a ton of calls from customers stating they were going to sue the company for bad products and I don’t blame them. All around bad company! I had a lot of calls from customers whose refrigerator stopped working within a month of buying it and it was a known compressor issue/recall and still being sold in stores. Customers waste a ton of money and time waiting for service all day to fix the appliance and no food/medicine loss compensation. 1-3 week wait for service. Customers wait months for parts from service.
It is hard work. Standing 10+ hours a day. Fast paced. Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons.

leadership and inconsistency with work demand
I cant really think of any cons.. other than the employee discount isn't what it should be.
If you fall behind, you have to put some hard work to get caught up. Also it successfully do the job you have know about the product. Thus, you find yourself putting extra time to learn about the new product and features.
- Early working hours - Short lunch period
Pay isn't the most competitive.
Leadership changes threw the company off internally
Hard to fire bad workers
Pay could be considered low depending on your geographical location. Sometimes whirlpool experience is seen as better than outside experience
Pay is very low and not enough headcount
-Work is hard, just like any other place, but is worth it.
Hard work often goes unrecognized. People are expected to shoulder additional work for months at a time when someone leaves the company.
Compensation, Career Development, Company supplements most open positions with employees from other regions under the guise of diversity. Consistently dealing with understaffed outsourced departments that further complicates normal operations. Funnily enough always finds >50% female acceptance to their WERLD program when they represent <15% of the engineering population.
Lack of investment in tools and systems, people leaders are not trained/coached appropriately, and leadership is focused on short term earnings management vs. innovation/long term investment.
Had to de-escalate calls from angry customers that are allowed to cuss at you because their expensive appliance stopped working shortly after buying it and they can not return. Management did not want you to contact them. I started with a group of 30 people and only 2 people stayed after 1 month of training. Calls are back to back and no breaks in between. You get two 10 minute breaks. You aren’t done with calls at 6:15 pm when you are scheduled. They stop calls at 6pm and there are hundreds left in the queue at 6pm that you have to stay late most nights until they are all cleared. I wouldn’t recommend anyone work for Whirlpool because you are the person the angry customers are taking all their frustration out on. I had a ton of calls from customers stating they were going to sue the company for bad products and I don’t blame them. All around bad company! I had a lot of calls from customers whose refrigerator stopped working within a month of buying it and it was a known compressor issue/recall and still being sold in stores. Customers waste a ton of money and time waiting for service all day to fix the appliance and no food/medicine loss compensation. 1-3 week wait for service. Customers wait months for parts from service.
Some of the internal audits are extensive and require a lot of dedicated time, in and out of work, to complete.

Corporate made most decisions which made it hard to accomplish things at the building level.
Siloed operations, poor benefits that continued to get worse, one size fits all for merit increases, work hard or not - get the same pay, wrong people making decisions - more likely based on cost and not quality, knowledge or impact, compensation at the low end of competitive wage scale, values and actions do not align

Customers yelling at you every day Understaffed so always have huge call wait times
Leadership is on a downfall
They will move you to a different shift without warning
This was the most mentally draining opportunity I have ever experienced. I did not know that Whirlpool, Maytag, Amana, appliances were so poorly manufactured. I had several consumers complain about how there appliances stopped working after 3-6 months of purchase. I have had people crying and fussing, because they are out of their manufactures warranties and now they don’t have the money to have their appliances repaired. I have had people call and complain that they can’t refrigerate their medication because the refrigerator generator went out and the parts are shipped from overseas with delays and no eta. This is the most dissatisfying and frustrating work experience I have ever had. You feel terrible at the end of the day because you have been cussed out all day and telling people there’s nothing you can do but to offer them an extended warranty ( more out of pocket expenses) or maybe a $20 gift card, to shut them up. All day you have to listen to the consumers complain and cry over the phone and you can’t do anything about it unless they asked to speak with a supervisor, and then it is still not resolved. People have to wait until there has been multiple repairs for the same issue, until they rescued to replace it with the same model, that will most like have the same issue. Make it make sense.
Horrible leadership horrible. Management will carefully choose when someone violates company policy depending on what employee it is. Management lies if they want you gone they'll do whatever needs to be done to get rid of you. Not everyone is held to the same standards.
For those who expect to climb up multiple levels in a short period of time, it may not be the best place to join. However, for those who believe in doing things right for a company that does the same, there are countless examples of long-term mutually beneficial and life-changing wins.
I wish the vacation policy was more generous. 0-4 years: 80 hours, 5-14 years: 120 hours, 15-29 years: 160 hours, 29+ years: 200 hours
Smaller town and nearby area
Could establish a better way for employees to give feedback & listen to suggestions more often, needs to improve workforce planning and communication of those plans.
No significant cons that I can think of.
they are very strict about every rule

Old school, slow career progression
limited flexibility to work outside of Michigan office if in marketing
Salary is a bit low for my geographic region. Did not receive a bonus after the economic downturn this year.
Better equipment , communication, breaks
Customers yelling at you every day Understaffed so always have huge call wait times
They treat people like they aren't human beings.
Unless you put in for a different position or location on site, it can get boring.
Have to be very much on time with low absence.
No significant cons that I can think of.
they are very strict about every rule
Pay is low for the amount of work you have to do. They let me go with no real reason as i was a top preformer for 2 years. They acted like they cared and that we are a work family untill i actually needed my ""work family"" lol
Unorganized management and no engagement
The people are the biggest con. Whirlpool is filled with selfish, arrogant, entitled people who refuse to help anyone but themselves. They take advantage of the few good employees by continuously dumping additional roles and work on them until they quit, meanwhile only promoting ""favorites"" that have zero job knowledge and add zero value to the organization. Promotions are definitely not based on merit or accomplishments. There are tons of people who only manage ""up"" and are not capable of, or simply refuse to, manage themselves, manage laterally, or manage down. The Culture takes next prize. Whirlpool unfairly approves certain individuals for fully remote roles, while requiring others to come into the office ""to collaborate and for the culture"". This ""collaboration"" often entails being the only individual around, because policies are not enforced equally across the groups and departments. Those that are in the office refuse to say ""hi"" as they walk by you (leadership included), refuse to join you in office meetings (they call in from their desk and don't even turn cameras on), and it feels like everyone hates their jobs, coworkers, and the company. Whirlpool also loves to push their ""values"" (Integrity? Respect? Work-life balance?), but I found that most employees and leadership do not actually follow the values and go so far as doing the complete opposite. Whirlpool is the only company that I've worked for where I've been asked to do unethical things, while simultaneously completing mandatory ethics training. Please know that if you're reading about their values, or Employee Value Proposition, the truth is the opposite. Whirlpool is the most toxic, poisonous and unprofessional workplace that I've ever experienced.
Old school, slow career progression
Lacks a lot technical sophistication with data and crm software.

Discretionary leave RTO and good management
Great coworkers, work independently. Respect
Onboarding is a bit shaky, but overall it is a great job that offers good work life balance. I've never had any issues taking time off for any reason. I also genuinely feel like my managers have all cared for and actively worked to help me in my career development.
They provide a flexible work environment
Great work/life balance, FSP client is great to work with, study/site workload is not extreme and client provides ability to work mostly remote. Unlimited PTO, and most major holidays are paid.

Absolutely amazing company all the way around
Opportunity to learn, great work life balance

People, salary benefits and they listen to employees.

I really do love my job and where I work. the PTO policy is amazing and my manager is very supportive
Good team environment, decent clients, routine time off and bonus structure
Parexel is such a great place to work. The leadership team cares about the employees and is always open for suggestions with making it a great place to work. The culture is very supportive even in this difficult time with lack of resources. Career development is available for people who want to move up.
Amazing colleagues, flexible work arrangements. Organizational culture is said to be 'with Heart' and I believe this to be true with respect to patient centricity and customer satisfaction. Career development opportunities are fairly good.
The benefits were pretty good.
Many opportunities to grow and help employees to learn
relatively flexible schedule. Nice colleagues and a good environment
","No real cons to speak of
No annual bonus and some not great sponsors
Concerned with the direction the company is going.
Can be difficult to move up or be promoted to a different position as roles are often limited to what the FSP clients are currently hiring for. Pay also seems on the lower end for this position.
Managers are inexperienced , poor “people” skills
Insurance (health/dental/eye) is pricey. There is a Parexel LM and a client LM-so double mgmt review of your work/meetings, etc.
No current cons to list
old tech stack, little attention to innovation
very corporate and getting worse
5 visit metric is amazing
very corporate and getting worse
some time training gap for cross functional team
Health insurance and health benefits
Local Mangers are worst as they dont followup with us
Poor management, high turnover, inadequate training, false promises of promotion within, low pay
False dedication to work family balance
you will work hard in this fast-paced environment rapid pace of change can be tough to keep up with
no real chance for growth pay not to scale with duties, industry, or title
None at this moment in time
Communication from upper levels could be more efficient/timely
Poor management, high turnover, inadequate training, false promises of promotion within, low pay
Can be high stress at times
Raises are 1-2% a year
False dedication to work family balance
no real chance for growth pay not to scale with duties, industry, or title
Line manager changes, frequent study changes
The bonus is not always paid out, and decision making can be very slow at the top levels.
At times a lack of support
On the road a lot
None I can think of
Guidance is unclear and so are processes
Very large company, small chance of development
The endless self promoting of select individuals is enough to make you vomit. 99.999% of the staff go unrecognized for hard work and success. 0.0001% is recognized for no accomplishments nonsense culture things that don’t contribute to the job and it’s to their own promotions. They overdue the diversity and inclusion. Best move leaving this corporate culture
No growth Salary is less
Not applicable everything was fine for me
It’s a relatively new program, so there are some kinks that need worked out.
Hard to archive No work life balance
mostl fully remote positions, no office based
Did not provide enough training and communication from higher management
No sense of culture at HQ
management, stressful environment and high turnovers
No work life balance. Pay is below industry standard.
would like more salary increase
Sometimes short staffed, so full-time workers are asked to do multiple jobs
There are None at the moment
Lack of CRAs, but it's an issue everywhere.
When it was time for promotions they didn't always want to promotion their staff. When trying to grow within the company it didn't happen.
Management, delegation of work isn’t good, favoritism @ it’s finest, disorganization
Career progression is not clear
Oh goodness, where to start. The culture is toxic and with the recent acquisition by a private equity firm it is going to get worse. There were no formal manuals (written or video instructions) for how to do my job. I can respect watching someone else do a process but alot of the functions can be complicated and need direct guidance. The IT team is the worst I have seen, and I would get reprimanded for not getting access to files in a timely manner, even though I was diligent in my requests. The work life balance is good at first until they pile on more work than you can handle and I would regularly work 55-60 hour weeks at a company that likes to tout their so called work life balance. Some of the KPIs are dumb, such as how fast you can remember details about a project when you are 50+ that you work on. My manager was toxic, micromanaging and made my performance worse than if I was on my own. Overall, this job was awful and took a massive toll on my mental health.
Resourcing is constantly lacking in several departments which leads to unreasonably high work loads. Only focus on negatives, there is no recognition for work done well.
-IT is terrible -Intranet is terrible -New LMS is terrible -Too many systems that are constantly being updated, added, or removed -Majority of COLs really do not know what they are doing -New CRAs are not being fully trained before they are asked to start conducting visits -CRA metrics are based on 3 remote visits is equal to 1 day on-site, which is unfair considering each remote visit has a report and there is always more prep and follow-up involved -HR is terrible and does not respond most of the time -Insurance premiums, copays, and out of pocket max greatly increased in 2022 -High turnover of staff -PTO was changed to RTO in 2022 and remaining PTO from 2021 was not paid out to employees. -Benefits are not that great
Heavy workload and consistently understaffed
Nothing bad to say. I enjoy
Systems heavy, and like most CROs they overpromise to sponsors which in turn can place unrealistic expectations on CRAs.
none at this time all is well
promotions are hard to come by
Management is an absolute nightmare
Micromanaging Stress level very high Bad management Lack of flexibility Employment at will Work under a scope/ no freedom
Same Proposal expectations / work as all the CROs
Career progression is not clear
Heavy workload and consistently understaffed
Nothing bad to say. I enjoy
Systems heavy, and like most CROs they overpromise to sponsors which in turn can place unrealistic expectations on CRAs.
none at this time all is well
promotions are hard to come by
observations and experiences have been: 1) lack of enough resourcing as too many projects are accepted at the expense of the employee (for profit of course) work life balance and leadership is sub optimal 2) decentralized company chooses to put people in a study team cross culture time zone with no regard for team cohesiveness or forethought it's just a body in a spot. 3) often times teams are comprised of inexperienced staff members in countries where labor is cheap and communication is poor. Leadership at study team level does not understand challenges on their projects as they are chosen based on pure availability and ther experience, probably because attrition is an issue
Not nimble due to Layer of management
Higher ups do not care about work life balance. Expect the workload to be overwhelming and demanding. Bonuses don't really exist. No progression possible in the company unless you know people, which is hard to cultivate when you are 100% remote. Benefits are astonishingly bad for a company in the Pharma world.
Onboarding Sponsors are better than CROs
I can not think of any.
This is a company where the quality of work goes to die. Most of the people I've had the ""opportunity"" to work with do not care about the quality of their work and no one seems to do anything about it. Because some of the departments are highly understaffed, I think line management cannot afford losing people (i.e., firing them) who deliver substandard work. So it's up to other people, usually functional leads, to clean up other people's messes (i.e., working extra hours, burning out and be highly stressed over it). Please get rid of people that only drag the company down. Perhaps consider employing people in countries where people value the quality of work and STOP employing people where it's CHEAP!
There is always too much work for the resources on hand, and the exceptional evening or weekend work is not exceptional at all.
There are no cons so far.
Very slow when there aren’t active studies.
don't know nay yet but we'll see
-PE owned and huge push to cut costs which means your role will be stretched thin. -Because everyone is stretched thing, you won't receive much help/time from your manager or co workers. Be prepared to be thrown in the deep in. You're responsible for swimming. No one will help you if you start to sink
Lots of turnover, which makes it really hard to work on longer studies
As any large CRO expect high workload but it comes with tons of opportunities
None that come to mind
None that come to mind
- working with international colleagues/clients often forces you to work odd hours - entirely remote (which is a plus to many, but can be isolating) - very high turnover rate, which I can only assume to be from less competitive pay and company-wide understaffing
A lot of repeat GCP trainings
Work like balance non existent.
Too many systems and programs.
Non what so ever. Thanks
there are no cons at this time
Can be overwhelming at times; will take some getting used to
none noted at this employer.
Difficult to take time off/need coverage, time off in the training portion is non-existent
Management level does not develop a cultivate culture.
Non I can think of at this time
Management is not engaged, constant change, no consistency. Very short with contractors.
sometimes you can end up working on projects with other that may not respect you so you definitely have to speak up for yourself and have a voice
Same as all med comms… workload varies and can be heavy at times.
Global resource challenges. Very yes focused company even when something is not achievable.
Parexel does not demonstrate 'Heart' for their frontline employees yet they demand that they go the extra mile, especially now that the company is going through rapid growth
The company has zero culture; everyone is stressed and rude, no matter what department you're talking to. You'll be given an unmanageable workload and escalated the second you start to fall behind. The only way to keep up would be to work 12+ hours a day. Systems are terrible, no one can tell you even rudimentary things, and a lot of time is wasted in unproductive meetings.
Need to provide better benefits
slow growth to the next level of salary. Just job-hopped

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Vector-Marketing-Reviews-E26785.htm,"U get to make alot of money and your selling really nice cutlery to the customer
The pros are absolutely making your own flexible schedule! Working from home when you want to, and working with an incredible team!
After I got surgery I wasn't able to do much at my last job. I actually prayed about a job and right after church got a text about this one! I am able to work at home through zoom calls and even make sales too! The time for training is worth it because they teach you as much as possible, and there are more things to learn after them too!
1. Super flexible staff and schedule 2. Super kind and considerate staff 3. Easy to work from home with kids or pets 4. Easy to get your feet under you when starting with the training they provide 5. Websites and Apps are easy to understand and navigate
The hours are flexible because it's what you put into it. I did a lot around other responsibilities I had going on that summer and I made sure my evenings on the weekends were left for hanging with friends. When you get to this level it should be easier.
It allows you to learn different skills you haven't been taught and has amazing teaching on becoming a great salesman. A very flexible job allows you to choose your own appointments and times. They care a lot about your future especially if you are a college student or athlete, they make sure to prioritize that as much as they can. If you want to start becoming and learning about sales Vector Marketing is a great opportunity to start at and maybe become your full-time job if you like it!
Remote job, do it anywhere Flexible at your pace and schedule Just requires a good internet connection
The managers are super helpful and criticize constructively for your benefit Premium product quality and the best customer service for wear and tear
The treatment of staff from this company is wonderful! I understand what it is like to work for horrible management and great management, and this company is great!
The base pay and commissions Flexible schedule Work from home Great for students who need extra income Scholarship opportunities Big Trip Opportunities( all paid for)
Cutco is an amazing company that works as a team to accomplish goals!
The best part so far has been the training and there lifetime warranty on all the products
You get paid $25 per demo even if you don’t sell anything. You gain amazing experience and learn so much that you can take into other jobs and build your resume.
Vector Marketing is an amazing company! So many opportunities to gain real-world experience, Easy to understand training. NO Quota!! If you like to work hard you really should apply here! It's worth it!
Your schedule is flexible, and your area manager is supportive, always encouraging you to call them. Online marketing allows for remote work, and training is paid for.
You will definitely Guaranteed work!!
Great at building up interpersonal communication as well as understanding certain business aspects head on. Training can be overwhelming, but managers are very supportive and will talk to you individually (even after training) if you are struggling. VM offers great staff and great products, you just have to be coachable and flexible.
Good Pay Wide variety of skills developed/acquired Remote Self-Paced Presentations
I left with a resume equivalent to a masters degree in business and there's not a single job I'm not considered for. Automatic interviews
The managers are very helpful at making me feel confident. They don’t make me feel like I’m bothering them and give me the opportunities to call them whenever I need help with a sale. They are extremely supportive when I am having trouble getting someone to book an appointment with me
Leadership was second to none.
I just started at this company. I love it. The managers are very friendly and want to see us succeed.
The skills: communications scheduling, and responsibility.
Everything else about it is good
100% Your own schedule!!??!!?? What!! Yup!! Vector marketing has a Team of understanding, patient and fun people! No matter your situation, if you need that little boost, this company is definitely here for you! Communication is key! If you dedicate yourself, they will see your efforts and will always be there.
very good in improving communication skills
You make alot of money if you put your time and thought in it and you take the time to learn and progress in this business i love it i would love to work here for the rest of my life
Pros about this job is how they help new representatives and how flexible the job is? The main thing I like about this job is how respectful the team and the great attitude they show?
Super thorough training Choose your own hours Teamwork building Good pay Fully online option Persuasive presentation script
So far everything is a plus, my experience was excellent
No better financial opportunity and culture if you are a outgoing, motivated, and driven person not afraid of being slightly confrontational

Easy money and fun to be at depending on office
Best job to have. I love how flexible the schedule is, training was amazing and I learned so much. In just a day of working here I already know that I’ll love it. I’m already so passionate about this job and what I do. I can’t wait to learn more and become one of the best employees.
The pay is amazing and the hours are very flexible! All the staff are friendly and they genuinely care about seeing you succeed at your job. Kate McDonough and Brandon Philips are amazing and just some of the greatest people I’ve met they are so real they’re down to earth they’re funny and they’re straight to the point don’t make it confusing when helping you and just some of the greatest people around honestly! It is one of the funnest jobs and most rewarding mentally that I have had just seeing all your hard work turn into success slowly over time!
I enjoyed the training session. Coworkers are extremely nice and friendly. Pay is fair.
The pay is actually pretty decent. As well, you kinda get to learn during training how to better communicate with customers and get to be well-informed of certain things.
The flexibility and opportunities are fantastic. I love that I can do this job in addition to other things going on in my life and easily work around them. The presentation slideshow is laid out quite well. I also love the slide by slide training we have for the presentation. Additionally, the product being sold is FANTASTIC. The sales presentation part of the job is actually kind of fun; the training is the disappointing part.
I just started working with Vector Marketing and I already love it. The team feels like family and they were so welcoming. I love working with Sam because she helps talk us through things when we need help, and shes always there for support.
Very easy to learn and the managers are great. You also have full control of your schedule and it is a remote job (except for some training sessions and meetings) which makes it even easier to work around your classes, other jobs, etc.
The training was very high-energy and the trainer was, in a word, amazing. Pleasant delivery and a thorough knowledge of the training program made learning comfortable for me. I'm a 69-year-old retired journalist and college professor who has been through countless trainings, and this one was, by far, the most engaging.
You have a open schedule to work whenever you’re available you also have an opportunity to further your resume and career by being able to get out your comfort zone and see how much your truly capable of doing while working with a team that truly cares about you
If you’re a very shy individual, this job can definitely help you out getting out of your comfort zone. MOST (key word: MOST) managers were very nice people.

Vector marketing promises sales experience with selling cutco brand knives. It is a great product and the work environment is professional.
The people there are enthusiastic about what they do. They also do a great job of keeping open lines of communication, answering any questions that fellow co-workers have, and fostering a continual growth mindset (not only in a monetary way).
This was a decent leadership opportunity

The opportunity sounds great on the surface when you're just looking for a way to make money. It has a flexible schedule.
The flexible schedule is a big pro, and management is super helpful and supportive
Great company to work for!
I was at first concerned about the no-pay training, however, it's worth it to go for free and learn what they have to offer there is no beating around the bush its real-world applications of Sales. The environment of the office is super positive and able to work with us completing sales out in the field or to work with us in general.
You can work either in home or in an office. You get to make your schedule to be as full or as slow as you want or need it to be. The people are great and there's room for advancement. Looks great on an resume if you do decide to leave the company. I'm recommending to my friends and family
I really love all the people part of the team! That all seem so caring and genuinely want to help. I can’t wait to start my journey!
The people are amazing, the product is world class, and it genuinely is the best job i’ve ever had
Control over your own schedule, friendly staff, ability to work virtually or in person
Easy money and fun to be at depending on office
You have a flexible work schedule, you know exactly what to do from training and constant communication with your employer so you are never left out of the loop
Great pay, great trainers, easy to move up, pay is based on your own effort, readily accessible to help you
It is a great job for boosting communication and presentation skills.
Flexible, great experience with awesome managers, and is self motivated with opportunities to move up!
Vector Marketing has the nicest and most supportive team behind them making sure to help each and every employee along their journey. They give detailed training to ensure that each and every employee is ready to go. They provide unlimited advancement opportunities and work with people from all different backgrounds. If you work here you are provided with amazing incentives such as a high rate commission that increases with your sales, vacations, scholarships, internships, and college credits. The more effort you put in, the more you will get back. They offer a base rate pay so no matter if you make any sales or not you are still being paid for the work you did. Work on your own time, in between classes, over the summer, whatever works for you and your progress will never be lost!
Some of the main pros would be the work environment, the flexibility in the schedules, helps me save one college tuition, and helps me develop life lasting skills.
Superior training, quality product, flexible schedule and great pay
I really love working at vector because the hours are so flexible!
I just started working here but I am started to like day one of training. I believe you should work here because it is a great company.
I really respect the leader in which they help you achieve goals while you put in work as well.
They offer great schedule's because you can make your own schedule. They also offer many different career plans for if you plan to work there for the summer or make it your life-time career.
× Pay × flexibility × Training × Nice coworkers × Experience
This work is great as it will give you a guaranteed pay as well as a good work experience and skills. This job is also good to put on your resume.

They remind you in a very subtle way that life is not a bed of roses. We are on a battle field and everyone has to stay strong and sound to get to the finish life. Vector challenges one to be autonomous and this is where lies the dignity of a human being : autonomy.
Pay is decent, including commission

It is a very friendly environment and it's easy to get motivated by our great managers who are there to help you along the way.
From day one I have experienced nothing but Love. I have been searching for a new job that offers more support. The Vector company offers that and more. Grayson Mitchell and Braden Crow are the heart of that company. I couldn't ask for a better company to work for. They offer you support, confidence, and tons of family Love. Thanks a ton
Great skill gaining opportunity and helps you develop as a person.
The best so far has all of the positive feedback and suggestions that I have received openly
A really fun experience and super nice people. They give you all the training you need and as I'm starting out I'm nervous but looking forward to more. :)
Flexibility, freedom, sociable job, enthusiastic
It’s flexible, and with the right contacts, someone definitely can be successful. The people are awesome, you get great motivation to work and succeed.
Love the motivation the company gives to us new employees, it really helps us to set a goal in mind while helping us to improve and develop certain skills, such as communication, teamwork to an extent, and even raising confidence.

","I have none really it's a good job
There aren’t really any. I think the one thing I might say is a slight con is the way customers have to share their recommendation text messages. The the introduce button is very confusing for some of my older clients because I have to explain to the that they have to create the text to then send to those contact. Most think the moment they click the contacts and hit share that it automatically shares it on its own to me. I wish there was a better way for them to do that. I also have no idea who is who when the number gets a text notification with me in the group chat. I wish it would take that contact’s name from the person’s phone and say “hey (insert name here), I am introducing you to my CutCo rep (insert my name here.” That way I know who I would be calling. In terms of work cons, the only thing I could ever see anyone complaining about is maybe just the amount of calls you have to make to really get those appointments and sales BUT that is what you need to realize you’re signing up for and you have to really want it! Make goals with this job!!
Trainings can only cover so much and if you have a few lows, you have to be able to bounce back from them!
1. I always feel like I am being micromanaged and sometimes wish they would trust in me to make sells without calling them so frequently (Like I work from home. give me some space) 2. Training was LONG (20 hours to be exact with NO pay) I felt like training was pretty repetitive and didn't need to be as long as it was. 3. The pay is good if you make a sale or if you are doing a demo but I don't feel like you are compensated for all of the time you spend preparing for, and scheduling demos 4. There are no benefits except for free product which makes this job hard if you need health insurance, PTO, etc.
It's really hard starting up and you'll hear rejection a lot. The hours are what you make it so if there's a day that you want to work but you aren't able to book anything then it really sucks
The training was the only thing that was difficult. But you have to push through to be able to have a great salesman journey. You may be nervous a bit, but conquering will definitely be the game changer in your journey as a salesman but also in life as well.
Commission based If no sale, no money You have to be good at selling in order to do good and progress at the job
No cons. Only takes time to get sales which should be expected
I truly have zero cons.
I think that it just taking time getting used to because I still am a myself but reading the script can be very difficult at times. You’d think it’d be easy but it can be a bit frustrating because it is a lot to read but It gets better after a while.
The training process may be long, but it is well worth it!
I haven’t had any downside so far, except just getting started with my demonstrations.
Even if you feel like you’re doing good there’s always going to be something you did wrong. Way to pushy and demanding for part time. Especially when you’re not paid hourly or gas to do in person visits. And having to use your personal phone is crazy. Not everyone can afford unlimited phone plans.
The only ""con"" is that you have to work hard to reach your goals
3 day, unpaid, 6-7 hour training before entry.
Honestly don't think there is any.
Sometimes it can feel like there's a little bit of pressure to perform very very well (especially if you were singled out in training), but the managers are understanding and willing to work with you.
-Large amount of weekly scheduled presentations
Not for people with a lack of self motivation or desire to grow
There so far aren’t any cons, even when my manager is not available they provided videos to help in case I get stuck in the process and cannot reach them.
I don’t have any negatives about the company.
There aren’t any cons so far.
I think doing a full practice demo on the last day of training might help. The short bits and pieces spread throughout the days were nice, but my first time doing the demo with the binder and the knives I was a little confused, but am slowly getting into a proper groove with each new demo.
No paid training at all.
The downfall thus far I've encountered is the fact I'm in a personal struggle, and well, my demos don't come easy as I thought. But through this, my Team is there for me to boost my confidence 100%.
none, the company is great
There are none its amazing here
I honestly as of right now there are no cons I think this company is really great for anyone who wants to learn a lot of new skills.
Pretty time-consuming Can be exhausting, especially online appointments Very lengthy training Have to call and schedule your own appointments Presentation slideshow is lengthy Technical difficulties are pretty frequent, troubleshooting skills are neccesary
No cons to report for this company
If you are not good at the job, it's pretty rough
none, the company is great
There are none its amazing here
I honestly as of right now there are no cons I think this company is really great for anyone who wants to learn a lot of new skills.
Pay structure and growth structure
Pretty time-consuming Can be exhausting, especially online appointments Very lengthy training Have to call and schedule your own appointments Presentation slideshow is lengthy Technical difficulties are pretty frequent, troubleshooting skills are neccesary
No cons to report for this company
Fast paced, so get ready. A bit of discomfort at first with the calls and appointments.
VERY overwhelming and draining, both physically and mentally. Managers/higher-ups can be pushy, sometimes in terms of personal boundaries (kinda act like they know your boundaries better than you do). Hard to balance work/personal life because of the pressure from higher-ups to completely book up your week with appointments/demos
Negative feedback and possible underlying sad truth about company but at least I was still getting a good check
No cons whatsoever in my opinion
The only con is that they don’t take out taxes which some people may find that that isn’t a con but when it comes the end of the year that’s gonna be a doozy!
I wish we were able to get a list of people who already have purchased cutco before as well so we can try to upgrade them as well. It was be hard to get appointments and people to purchase with inflation and today's economy.
While the pay is decent, you can’t always seem to have a good idea of how much you’re going to make from a weeks worth of work. Commissions are great, but even after following the MAC Customer rule, there’s no real guarantee that they’d buy anything. Then again, that’s just life: No guarantees.
1) During training, I felt like I was pushed heavily by supervisors to get sales presentations scheduled. It was very invasive of my schedule and my personal life; the supervisors assumed I walked into training having absolutely nothing scheduled for the first weekend except sales presentations. I understand the desire to get sales, but it was far too aggressive for a successful and upstanding company. 2) The patience level during training really depends on your supervisors. If they are great and fun supervisors, training will be fun. If they are impatient or not understanding, training will be dreadful.
There are no problems with working in Vector Marketing.
So far I have not noticed any downsides.
The amount of information might be better served by a few more hours, perhaps start with full 6.5 hour first day, making the entire program 19.5 hours instead of 18. That would make the final day less hectic.
If you don’t put the work in you won’t see success but that’s just life
The demo is wayyyyyyyy too long to be presenting to friends and family. I’m sure there’s probably rich families that actually buy expensive knives, but most average families wouldn’t buy them. I personally don’t like how I would start of “practice” with my family and knowing they are not going to buy thousand of dollars worth of knives. I think it’s a waste of time how I have to call the office or my manager saying my family are not interested in buying particular sets and basically force me to show them other expensive sets knowing my family would not buy them. Also, I was pretty disappointed how the only way I can get appointment is to force people to download the app and share their PERSONAL CONTACT. I’m sorry, I don’t want my dad friends to be getting a random text how his son is trying to sell expensive knives. Oh yeah, did I mentioned to benefits?
No cons whatsoever in my opinion
The expectation that they do not tell you until you've ""bought in"" to their ideas is that as a Sales Manager you will have to generate your own sales contacts. Unless you have previous experience ethically sourcing sales contacts, you will have no other option than to use the contacts in your phone. Taking advantage of friends and family is extremely encouraged by management.
The first couple weeks of training and being on the job can seem overwhelming due to the nature of the task—especially if you are new to sales.
There was so much pressure to recruit people who didn't want the job. If it was truly a valuable opportunity you should not have to pressure people into it.
The only con is that they don’t take out taxes which some people may find that that isn’t a con but when it comes the end of the year that’s gonna be a doozy!
cold calling if you do not like that
I wish we were able to get a list of people who already have purchased cutco before as well so we can try to upgrade them as well. It was be hard to get appointments and people to purchase with inflation and today's economy.
The training hours are way too long in my opinion. I didn't like having to wait till nine for it to be over. I didn't like having to get contacts with people I already know. Before, I thought it was Vector/Cutco that would get the contacts.
The job can be overwhelming, and sometimes making sales is difficult but the more effort you put in the more you get out.
Very low pay and high commitment
The only Con in my opinion is I feel like we out of the gate have to go go go get the sales for the 10 day track program. However, I like the ambition in the goal as well.
The two day training isn't paid but they do give you all the tools you need to succeed. It would help to have some names to get started in case your one of the people that don't have many contacts
Something I would try to change is not having too many Zoom training programs since it’s hard to get the full experience and get all your questions answered. But other then that it was great!
nothing is wrong with this company at all

I didn’t find any cons with working here
It is very demanding and I feel like it is a job that you have to dedicate a lot of time towards.
None, it’s really what you make of it
Have to market for yourself but this adds up over time.
I can't really think of any cons. The managers are great and they make this job fun.
I can’t think of any
The knives are pretty expensive so even though they’re really good quality, they’re sometimes hard to sell.
there isnt really any cons
No cons but if any just N\A
For the most part, there are not any huge cons. One con could be that it is stressful at first, but that is with any new job.
The cons weren't much evident besides you being made to call your family to make them prospects.
You need to submit a report on time to get your pay.
It’s hard to come up with any cons. I only have one, too prideful.
The two day training isn't paid but they do give you all the tools you need to succeed. It would help to have some names to get started in case your one of the people that don't have many contacts
Have to work with the ultra rich, not the working man
Something I would try to change is not having too many Zoom training programs since it’s hard to get the full experience and get all your questions answered. But other then that it was great!
Pay could have been better.
nothing is wrong with this company at all
As much as we need money to survive, life is not always about money. There must be a balance in our social, economical and spiritual lives to stay in the race.
You pay for your own training. You are unpaid and actually pay and travel for your training. The entire company is a pyramid scheme. Stay away
You sometimes feel a lot of pressure but it really depends on you.
I didn’t find any cons with working here
It is nerv-racking and a little complicated to get the hang of. A lot of interacting with people you might not know that well.
Wish I had known this company soon. Need more advertising
you may not get sales right away.
The worst is not selling anything yet but I know that's all part of the job. But I do have some potential orders coming in a few days
The training not being paid is a little bit of a downside, but we did get free food. :) That extra pay requires you to be really committed to this, so only go into it if you're comitted.
cold calling if you do not like that
It can be difficult to start at first.
On the downside, I personally find it a little sketchy still to only advertise about the products through word of mouth and recommendations mostly. Still, I suppose it's much better than going up to some random stranger and asking them if they'd be interested in listening to our presentations.
The training hours are way too long in my opinion. I didn't like having to wait till nine for it to be over. I didn't like having to get contacts with people I already know. Before, I thought it was Vector/Cutco that would get the contacts.
The job can be overwhelming, and sometimes making sales is difficult but the more effort you put in the more you get out.
Very low pay and high commitment

Atos has been primarily a remote company long before the pandemic for most of North America. If you work well remote, it's a great remote work environment, you are not feeling alone and the comradery really is good for a large primarily remote company.

","you get stuck in one position
Corporate Environment: Large companies can sometimes have a more structured and bureaucratic work environment, which limit flexibility and autonomy in decision-making. Work-Life Balance: The nature of consulting, especially in large places, lead to demanding work schedules and tight project deadlines, impacting impacting your work-life balance. High Expectations: Being associated with a reputable company can also mean that client expectations are high, putting pressure on me to consistently deliver exceptional results. Travel Requirements: Depending on the projects and clients, you are required to travel extensively. This can be exciting but draining if too long. Project Instability: Consulting projects can be volatile, with contracts changing or ending abruptly.
-working remote, didn't really get to meet anyone -lack of team building
Very little to any opportunities to learn alongside a knowledgeable person. High turnover, which is normal to the IT field. They don't give great raises. You'll have to take a job somewhere else for your raise, and you might come back later, and they'll give you a raise. Seems foolish to me.
Hard to contact HR if you need support
Not enough raises to keep up with inflation
Getting some Members to provide/upload necessary documen
Significant company transformation can bring a lot of unknows & uncertainty
Too much red tape with global teams: over communication without pertinent direction nor support
It is perfect to work but as all may be has some drop points
Programs to allow employees growth their career is awful complicated.
I know I could be making more money elsewhere, and this is ""managed service"" work so if the contract isn't renewed, I'll have to find new work internally or my employment will end.
Too much favoritism and no advancement due to favoritism.
you can't get a pay raise, even when you dedicate nearly 20 years to hard work and good reviews. It takes approval at such high levels to get a raise, it almost never happens. The same day you see that a 400m contract was renewed, you will get asked to wait six months for a small merit raise.
very little chance of getting raises. small chance of moving up. have to wait for people to leave, move up or get fired to really promote
With the loss of Eviden and the planned layoffs post divestiture the Atos team is hard at work trying to turn Eviden into a baby Atos for job security and to try and get revenue from them. This is will end badly for Eviden because Atos uses EoL infrastructure.
not much frequent growth in the company
The company should pay more.
Don't have many cons to present
Not much opportunities for growth.
The company should pay more.
Don't have many cons to present
Not much opportunities for growth.
High call volume, Lack of resorces from managent
It's a global company, you can feel like just another number and insignificant.
The company Lied from day one. In all the interviews the position was described as a 6 month temp to perm-position. On day one i was informed that the company never hired anyone to perm for IT positions and that they would move me from Temp Company to Temp Company as they saw fit to avoid labor laws. The pay rate was calculated at a 2080 hour pay rate but since the position is temp and there are no paid holidays the yearly hours are really only 1960 with the company holidays. The Management is a joke and no one knows what is going on at any given time. I have worked for the company for 2 years and still don't know who my manger is or who approves my time-card. My reporting Manager over my account changes on what seems like a monthly basic without warning or notification.
Not a lot of upward mobility
Poor starting pay rate, Multiple years with no pay raise. no support from middle management (very high attrition rate) Insufficient support per division (lack of enough techs to support workload. Insurance is ridiculously high, comparatively speaking.
Terrible culture, understaffed to keep customer costs down which leads to over-working and no work-life balance, don't follow processes and no leadership from office of NA head.
The organization is very big. Getting used to how long things take or how complicated processes are is challenging. There is uncertainty about contracts that could effect pay and benefits or employment.
Useless industry head team who doesn’t know any details and always cut out from reality. Worst structure ever in an organization who have sales and management teams on top of operations team which makes no sense
Have to ask for salary increases yourself and they’re not very giving. Don’t expect much pay increases if any at all (only offer yearly).
Leadership has for years told staff in townhall meeting/etc that they support US workforce and that its not true that they're reducing US staff. We'll I can tell you that is exactly what is going on at Atos.
US struggled year after year. Rotating door of US CEOs and execs sent from EMEA. Lack of long term vision & p lans
Raises are non-existent. In my 10+ years I received 2 raises. On top of that, twice we were asked to give up a weeks salary to bolster increased profits, for a better stock price. We were not told that, but after much investigation, that was the reason. We did not have to work during the week you decided to give up, but still. A week of vacation was taken away from employee's with over 10 years, and the amount you could accrue was reduced from 5 weeks to 4, along with reduced sick leave. Additionally if you work in a VEBA state, you get less paid time off than your non-VEBA counterparts.
Poor pay, it's a sweat shop, they don't respect your private time or your car. They sometimes require you to do unreasonable tasks i.e. driving long distances for an indefinite time. Atos does not pay their bills. You can't talk to upper management. No open door policy.
Very stingy with pto-You're stuck with 3 weeks of PTO (that includes vacation and sick time together) until 5 years after your start date. No opportunities for promotion. No yearly bonus. No yearly raise outside of ""merit"" increases. merit increase raises are tiny <3% when inflation was > 8%. Embarrassing company portal myatos.net site barely works and looks like it was organized by just randomly nesting links everywhere. Company doesn't live up to its values- they celebrate contracts with Nestle and the international Olympic committee when being a leader in decarbonization is in the company mission statement.
Very poor internal systems and process. Best the customers do not look behind the curtain so to speak. Employee services and systems are subpar. Poor communication. Never made the folks absorbed through the contract feel welcomed as part of the team
Many acquisitions, challenging to collaborate with various tools of acquisitions.
Processes are cumbersome and time consuming
Nothing to say, everything looks good
no work less scope for learning
I don't have any comments
They limited hours to below full time
No support, no training, very chaotic and the management from France clueless of what is going on. Pay and benefits mediocre at best.
This is a foreign company and does not have an interest in the United States other than revenue. The employees are expendable except for the old management running shady accounting practices and busy trying to cover up bad business practices.
The work load can be a tad bit much.
When the team manager is bad, everything falls apart. My current team manager is misogynistic and places blame everywhere but themselves. Trying to report them has been futile because they're very tight with their superior (who we are supposed to report to) and nobody can give an answer to who our HR is, how to contact them or how to find their contact. The company will find any excuse not to pay you, and absolutely does not listen to anyone but the bottom line.
No company culture. You're just another employee. No outings or appreciation. Difficult to move into a different positions
- Terrible management - Overworked employees (average 60 hours/week) - Benefits are worthless
No support, no training, very chaotic and the management from France clueless of what is going on. Pay and benefits mediocre at best.
This is a foreign company and does not have an interest in the United States other than revenue. The employees are expendable except for the old management running shady accounting practices and busy trying to cover up bad business practices.
Went through large employee loss in 2020.

It is a huge company, and I feel a bit like a number.
no that i can think of at the moment
No salary raise or promotions, Bad management practices, punitive actions and retaliation from Web Systems area against foreign employees *(aka Landed Resources).
-it has no remote jobs
Constant organizational churn makes you feel like you are working on a hamster wheel- never know exactly what you are tasked to do because it changes almost every day.
Didn't came across any in the timeframe of working there.
It is nice for new joiners
dont have cons point in this company
Leadership values liars over honest workers. No oversight into how employees are being treated. Expect to work holidays, birthdays, and emergencies. Leadership does not properly train their employees and expects them to monitor for clients alone throughout the night. The individuals hired to train you will talk down to you and choose favorites. All of the individuals initially hired with me quite around the same time I did due to a toxic work environment & and having their research stolen from them. Overall, expect to not learn much and to have your confidence diminished working with Atos - Reston, VA.
Pay increases could be more
had a stroke & got rid of me really quick! i did an outstanding job for company but wasn't good enough to keep my job. I'm doing a little better & still slowly recovering. working on pertest skills & career going forward. treated me like a perp after i fell ill. go somewhere else. they don't kick you to the curb. they kick you in the middle of the interstate during rush hour! run now if you can!
Only received one raise in 10 years, after Xerox merged with Atos, the benefits went from decent to worthless. I was part of implementing CyberArk, and automated PAM software, which reduced my workload so low that when they merged again, I was let go along with a number of other folks.
1) Worth the benefits of all SI's. 2) No health coverage for working spouse 3) Acquired companies not merged and working in silos 4) The company split has caused an exodus of good talented people in North America 5) North America is the first target for RIF as it is easy to get rid of people in the US than in Europe. 6) Run as a government-run organization due to large government contracts in Europe 7) Internally focused and not on clients 8) Best benefits for european employees
No cons to list right now.
There is a lot of turnover
None a whole lot of things
Executives out of touch with employees in the trenches. Hyper focus on profit margins creates a lot of red tape that makes completing tasks difficult.
Toxic work enviorment. Coworkers waiting to plant their knife in your back at any opportunity. Supervisors/team leads are lazy and stupid. Lots of favoritism and kissing up to the boss. Lots of liars. Nobody is truthful or honest. A disgusting place to work.
No work life balance, lot of fire fighting
low wages compare to others internships
Could not add spouse to Health insurance. If spouse employer provides insurance.
* Rigid authority structure. * BUs not credited for all hours. * Favoritism. * Very high offshore targets. * Very high resource turnover. * Expectation of large amounts of unbilled hours. If you do not work them, then you are chastised for underperforming. If you work excess and log them, you are chastised for affecting the project bottom line. If you work excess and do not log them, then all is fine unless you are caught, in which case it's your fault for compliance violations. * Very poor planning for account onboarding, resource staffing * Very poor communication from management. * Management is not supportive nor helpful. * Management style is hostile, blame based, and abusive. * Management ignores complaints for resources, tools, and compliance issues. * Management uses slander/libel as part of staffing program. * Surveys are selectively provided to employees who rate the company well.
All of the above. Bottom feeder personified.
Don’t have many opportunity.less clients. Poor management
Poor contracts and cheating the customer
Theyre own system for how employees access benefits and such is a bit outdated and could use a facelift. it is kind of hard-to-find information.
Doesn’t really allow employees to be successful and very hard to do business with customers
As an FTE the pay is horrible. They encourage you not to put spouse and children on your health plan. If your spouse is employed they have to go with their employers health plan even if it is horrible. Constant lay offs, No bench time, hardly any vacation, insurance is ok, but in the end just a not a nice place to work. A project of mine got cancelled due to covid and I was on the block for layoffs along with others. But then again they have constant layoffs.
The pay was low and you felt like your position would be eliminated.
they should work on team management
Inability to quickly provide solutions without an emergency.
HR policy and Process for employee
None a whole lot of things
Need new direction and leadership, swimming in circles
Executives out of touch with employees in the trenches. Hyper focus on profit margins creates a lot of red tape that makes completing tasks difficult.
Constant restructuring by Europeans that are clueless on how business operates in North America. Endless creation of ""processes"" that are complicated, unresponsive and inflexible to internal and customer stakeholders. Having a presentation of something does not mean that it exists, stop doing this!
- Management is not as technically advanced as expected and sometimes hard to communicate with. - Management would check to see whether we were ""online"", very frequently. - Management took a lot of time to address questions or concerns, sometimes even weeks of repeatedly having to bring it up. - Lack of communication between work streams throughout the team and clearly in management.. Ex. One manager being unaware of us getting raises or not only until the day before. As well as some management not being aware of the tools or platforms being used on projects.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Maximus-Reviews-E6725.htm,"Recognizes potential and provides great training tools.
I enjoyed the job itself and my direct team, and this was a good role for me to get into the human services field, they do hire people without much experience. Pretty sure the starting pay has gone up since I was there, around $18 an hour or more. Decent place to get experience but wouldn't recommend a long term career there. Was nice to help families avoid eviction or get out of doubled up housing situations into their own place.
One of the highest paying jobs in the area for a call center. You can work from home if you have a disability. There is lots of overtime during the busy season October to Mid January.
Working for a good cause (helping veterans) and working remote. Still some great people that work there but most of the good ones left when Maximus bought the company.
Job satisfaction is great when you truly are able to help people in need. Availability to work remotely

The pay was great and the pay was weekly. Team was really nice and attentive
Supportive management and coworkers Easy VTO M-F only Team building events
Although I have changed projects, my time as a Coordinator was very well spent. A senior management agent in the company went to bat for me to get the position, and I feel it paid off significantly. My immediate supervisor was present (metaphorically) and supportive, and upper management was as well. They stay involved, keep us informed, and respect us as individuals. The work is manageable, and the flexibilities of insurance comfortable as well. HUman resources is extremely proactive, and a representative has been in regular communication about opportunities with the company.
There is support whenever needed and it’s nice to be able to be a role in helping Veteran’s. This company actually cares and puts in the time and effort to from their employees, rather than constantly put down for mistakes.
Good benefits, good camaraderie, support all the way and understanding
good work environment, good benefit with unlimited PTO

As much overtime as you could want. Some bonuses. Remote work. PTO.

Employment Holidays paid (follow the government)

You can get some experience in the IT field, but what you do is very limited. The pay is decent, the supervisors are generally nice, they hire most people.
Professional and professional so many professional professionals
I enjoy working for Maximus. I've been working here for about a year now and everyone on my teams have been really helpful, patient as I get to understand the work environment. We have lots of communication across other division. compensation and benefit are fair for the job expectation.
Some of my coworkers were cool
Great Environment, Great Staff, Great Location.
First of all this a full remote job. Altogether training is about 90 days which is split into 4 weeks of classroom training, 4 weeks of ojt, and then 4 weeks of conversion (post ojt).Most colleagues appear to be nice and easy to work with. I was promised a one dollar raise from 14.00(training rate) dollars a hour and a 1,000 dollar bonus at conversion.(afterpost ojt). Also a bonus was promised every business quarter up to about 300 or 400 dollars if you met your metrics. A week into training my region went full remote because the company was not renewing their lease and from my understanding planning to increase the scope of remote work oppurtunities across the state of Texas. This is a good a job to gain real work experience in case management and institutional knowledge if your interested in the social worker career track or working in non-profits organization that help in serving poor and underserved communities. Personally I have picked up some new soft skills. Another thing is since this company is contracted with a government agency having this job on your resume will make easier for future employment in other government agencies. One more thing this is the classic 8 to 5 pm or 9 to 6 pm range 8 hour a day Monday through Friday off on every weekend and federal holiday plus some state only holidays type of a job.
Remote, good pay, provided equipment
Great job and benefits, pay is average

Nothing good to say, horribly managed, little training, the information resources are not updated and not enough staff to train it’s new staff.
Descent pay, not the best but descent. You get to change up projects every few months or years. So you are doing something new from time to time.

A small percentage of the people you meet along the way are pleasant and I’m still friends with to this day. That’s it. I would also like to clarify that I worked here from 2014-2016 but was unable to select it above.
Unlimited time off for salary employees
Easy work and somewhat decent pay
The hours are pretty flexible at Maximus. My position was fully remote which was fantastic. I had some great supervisors
Maximus/VES is a lovely place to work and it allows me to help one our nations most vulnerable populations....Veterans
The job itself is wonderful, I have a wonderful team, and I actually LIKE the leadership here. Very diverse staff, benefits are great, and I feel like I am appreciated for what I do.

","Takes awhile to get promoted
Very cliquey, and lots of rules and regulations, staff from other departments could be very gossipy and cause issues, and upper management enforced a lot of stringent expectations. Noticed a lot of staff would talk down to clients though, which was sad to me. They are also very concerned about audits and about the state's goals and expectations, which also dictates salary. Not much vacation or sick time, insurance is meh.
The healthcare plan stinks. The free option has a $4500 deductible that you have meet with no co pays before. The buy up plan costs you $50 a check and still have a $2500 deductible.
Upper management is horrible, no respect for employees, earnings are all over the place and the health insurance is the worst
It can be a little monotonous and there is always those irate callers that will give you a hard time.
Losing our jobs and not being offered a new one
Quota incentive Challenging Material for training Complex processes.
they dont telll you how it will be part time you get no breaks to use the bathroom
Poor work life balance for employees
Management not well equipped and no recognition for hard work.
The company is highly focused on maintaining contracts, but they'll put employees through the grinder if it suits business needs. Mandatory overtime that you cannot decline, massive system issues with no guidance, etc.
Upper management is horrible, no respect for employees, earnings are all over the place and the health insurance is the worst
Sometimes calls can be frustrating or upsetting Things can be either hectic and busy or slow and casual
Only downsize is that scope of work is based off contracts and sometimes they are lost not because of the work staff do but off the scoring of cost on the Request for Proposal (RFP).

6 min bathroom break or you have to deduct time of your card and if it becomes a habit of aux 2 (6min) , its disciplinary action up to termination for taking longer then 6 min. Some supervisor , mostly spanish , would like to get you in trouble to have you fired for them to be promoted. You only get 30 min and 2 (15) min breaks, launch , if over 3 min on top of 30 m in you got to deduct off time card. Not a lot of opportunity to grow, seniority. no phone , paper, books or pens, pencils. Annoying consumers asking for 1095a, like they keep throwing the ones the company send them in the garbage because consumer think 1095 dont effect their taxes. Vacation not earn till a year later.
- Company culture is pretty bad - Felt like I was limited when I was being ambitious and trying to over achieve - Health insurance.. For CSRs health insurance was terrible.
Poor oversee/training of managers that sometimes are promoted from within but not thoroughly evaluated for position's aptitude including organizational perspective, business ethics and leadership ability.
Not the greatest pay, you can definitely find better pay for the same job elsewhere.

Customer attitudes No PTO No holiday pay Lack-luster benefits
Working directly on the phones means you will sooner or later take calls that will result in a hostile caller. Some of these can be extremely troubling, but it is important not to internalize such things. I have not found it as easy as I might hope to discover everything about training opprotunities to expand my skills.

Doesn't reward hard workers. Caters too much to slackers. Perverse incentive structures because of this.
The work is very easy and all you really do is sit and read from scripting but it does get repetitive and draining, you don’t really get any benefits or paid time off until you’re a full time employee.
- Company culture is pretty bad - Felt like I was limited when I was being ambitious and trying to over achieve - Health insurance.. For CSRs health insurance was terrible.
Insurance sucks. Pay is not very good. We can earn bonuses if we meet production but that’s really hard to do sometimes. Everyday we get multiple emails saying we aren’t doing enough to meet dept goals.
No sick PTO No unpaid leaves
Hours can get long when there is a crunch. But this isn't constant.
Supervisors don’t help much and they are very micromanagement
Low pay. Low moral. Depressing work environment. Overworked people. Understaffed so executives can pocket more money. No raises so executives can pocket more money. Executives only care about themselves and their investors. Dishonesty and zero transparency from the leadership team. Pretend to support every possible cause and race ever to walk the earth with empty emails but step on these people every chance they get and do nothing to make their everyday lives better. Keep people down with low wages and horrible benefits. Hypocrites at the highest levels.
The manager at the help desk is condescending, makes a habit out of belittling and embarrassing those who ask questions, the office admin (who is a woman) would go into the men’s bathroom and take pictures of what she found to be gross and then post them in the office teams chat in an attempt to embarrass whoever left a mess, they’ve cut benefits 3 times since I’ve been here, they put T2s back on calls and stopped ticket working while our tickets queue piles up. Like I said get your experience and move on to the next job.
Stringy professor with professionals and professionals
I don't have any cons right now.
Horrible pay, bad location, worse work environment
IT Issues will sometimes hinder CSRs momentum.
This job entails working with multiple screens and systems. The equipment they issue to you is brand new and if you quit you only have 24 hours to return the equipment before declaring it stolen and it will cost you about 2,000 dollars if you damage the equipment. For this level of job I find the pay is low. For my region of San Antonio, TX the median range for this type of job is 17.00 dollars a hour and its definitely lower than the national median. Also the way they process the acceptance letter and the fact there is no one on one discussion with the recruiter leaves no room to negotiate on pay. On the disclosure at the end of the application it gives the pay range as from 9.00 dollars a hour to 19.23 dollars hour. In the beginning during the first two weeks of training Maximus sold themselves hard as a inclusive nontoxic work culture and that promotions internally are easy. There are a few warning signs this might not be all true or lies by omission. One they have mandatory overtime we discovered about the 3rd or 4th week of claassroom training. We were informed we would have someone experienced shadowing every day during ojt and for me it didn't happen until the 3rd week of ojt. Also during classroom instruction we were told time was not a issue for case research but that is not true because now they are talking about adherence during the last part of ojt. So this training was not the best and now that I'm learning about these requirements and restrictions it is a big turn off. Attrition rate until now is high. I started with class of 44 people and we were down to 17 people post ojt. I expect to lose more by full conversion because now when asked about the 1,000 dollar bonus we were told it can take 30 to 60 days to be paid out when I distinctly remember someone asking about this in first few weeks of training that when you convertwere you are paid in full the bonus and we were told yes.
Poor management, training was okay
No room for advancement, it’s difficult to get higher paying positions

Benefits and compensation sucks for being a government contracted job. Also not much room to grow.
questionable policies, values quantity over quality, does not listen to employees’ concerns, hard to move up, mentally draining work
Growing within the company is very slow
The training was insufficient, and you will be written up if you do not progress through training at the desired speed. You are expected to complete 25+ DBQ per day in addition to maintaining prior cases until submitted.
Not many growth opportunities Can be disorganized Contract only
There’s little to no guidance, after poorly and inadequately trained staff struggle to do their job. The company is marketed to public as if it’s a line to social services therefore most callers are in dire need of help which Maximus isn’t directly linked to. The amount of emotional stress is unreal and there aren’t any resources or acknowledgment of what the nature of this company really is—a doormat for NY poorly run healthcare system.
When a project ends you never know if you will have a job or not. If there are not available positions, you are out of a job.

Sad management. Working on a government project about health care payments. My immediate manager is abusive, and clueless. Our instructions change every week. There is no training program. Money is OK, not great.

When you ask for help, they want you to figure it out on your own. Last shifters (6 pm) dont leave at 6 pm -- they will keep you until the queues are clear. (You have to wait for the ""all clear"" email - Which I find s*upid. They treat you like a child, use the bathroom only on breaks or lunch. Calls are non-stop you cant go in aftercall to write your notes , gotta do it while youre on the call. The supervisors are a joke, especially Sandra. They expectations are way too high. And the pay sucks . Only lasted 3 months at that job. No Life at work Mentally draining Should I keep going?
The culture is as toxic as it comes. I still have PTSD from this job. I would exceed my quota regularly and receive quarterly bonuses for the quality of my work, but management focuses on the wrong things. Every time you have to go to the get up from your desk to go to the bathroom or get water you had to put yourself in “break”. And when you were working on something you would put yourself in that specific tasks code. Break was also used for the 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. The water cooler is across the building in the Albany location and far away from the research floor. My manager asked me if I had something going on because they saw me “put myself into break” more than the 2 breaks and lunch. I also was reprimanded for getting up to walk away to take an important phone call. If you are on any medication that makes you parched and thus increases the number of bathroom breaks, then you’re not in a good position. Keep in mind I was producing high quality work with little to no errors and exceeded quota and this was still brought to my attention. They track what you’re doing from minute to minute and it’s an extremely stressful environment. I wouldn’t wish this place on my worst enemy. Employees are essentially treated like cattle. ALSO if you watch the Trials of Gabriel Fernandez on Netflix they touch on how corrupt this company is. It starts from the top and trickles all the way down.
Management throughout departments do not communicate
Awful people and awful leadership
Expected, but not mentioned whether or not, you would work overtime on projects. Low pay. Poor (and expensive) benefits. Some supervisors and managers would simply tell you to de-escalate when speaking with abusive callers. Upper management were also extremely strict when it came to scripts-- even when the scripts were nonsensical.
None for me and I am 2 years into employment.
Can't think of any cons at this time.

This entire review will be broken down with Before Acqusition and After Acquisition, since a lot of the other reviews keep mentioning how things were while wearing rose tinted glasses. Before Acqusition Pro's (No longer valid): ================================ - More team outtings, more team dinners, better team building activities. - Culture was better for smaller teams, and harder to improve for larger teams due to budgetary concerns. - Sales cycle was fine at first, became very convoluted towards the end - Publicly traded so we had the ability to do a Stock Purchase Plan - 1-2 Work-from-Home days for certain Orgs, or full remote for other Orgs. - Great new hire experience until we were fully remote during Covid, new hires failed often when full remote due to the lacking training infrastructure for this model - More laid-back environment, but came at a cost of nothing really getting done towards the end. After Acquisition Pro's ================== - We're now fully in office (also has some CONs in of itself), making the new hire experience significantly better, and reduced the time to train from (fully remote) 12-16 months to 6-12 months due to real time collaboration. - Getting headcount that we desperately needed in many orgs (see cons) - Good restructure that makes sense on paper - Reduced linear reporting, no longer have Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers reporting to Sr Managers. Now it's more linear and easy to follow - Payscale increases to be at or above industry standard, significantly reducing churn comparatively - Promotion opportunities more easily accessible - Complete redesign of our internal Standard Operating Procedures, making things make sense again. - Company hands out Private Equity Shares to those who contribute to getting things back on track - When you need to work from home, you can. There is a system in place that allows you to work from home with your direct Managers approval. - Unlimited PTO if given 2 weeks in advance. Sick Days are still metered, but PTO for trips and such are not. - Still has great insurance and benefits as we did prior to the Acqusition, though I do miss the EPO plan which was removed.
The compensation is very good

Great place to work for! Some of the best managers.
Citrix is going through a lot of changes and challenges. Much of that pain has been self-inflicted and accumulating over the recent years. The company has many outstanding people. They value real team work, possess a get it done attitude, and strive to help everyone around them succeed.

There are non anymore. The company got purchased and went private. They do not care about customers or employees
Large Cafeteria and big office. A lot of opportunities
Now, zero. None. No pros at all.
Work-life balance Culture Office space
great products, engaged team, good compensation
Everything supporting my decision to join Citrix has been removed by the new CEO, Tim Krause, and his fellow leadership team.
People are good with good culture
","complex code base it took me a while to learn how it works
Management could be better, there are still Directors that don't know what they are doing.
Most of the information needing to read will be in this section. Having read through almost all of the reviews since the acqusition, many of these reviewers tend to look at the past with rose tinted glasses. I'm sure the experience between these individuals is drastically different than my own or even each other, but it's important to remember that our stock price didn't fall to $90/share because of what our new leadership did. The old leadership did a number on the Citrix organization that will take years to recover from, and the anger rightly deserves to rest with them. Not to say the new leadership is absolved from bad policy, but a majority of these policies are being created to fix what the former leadership did incorrectly. CONS: Prior to Acquisition: Prior to and up to Henshall and his subordinates ========================================================== - After Mark Templeton, Leadership cared more about the shareholders than you, and it was obvious. This got worse year over year. - Teams were completely gutted or skeleton crewed to make the numbers look better. - Hiring cycles were a disaster. You'd be given 30 days to fill x-number of req's, which included the time of advertising, interviewing, making a decision, etc. This forced teams to hire the ""good enough"" instead of the right talent. If you couldn't make a decision by your 30th day, then the req was frozen, pulled and who knows when it'd be released again. This caused us to not be able to staff people who left, let alone get the right headcount for the staff we needed. - Poor business decisions resulting in a very bi-polar stock price. I.E Temporary licenses during covid were an outright failure. Poor purchases that left us hundreds of millions of dollars in debt for an item that didn't improve our portfolio or weren't used at all. - Hyper investments into poor performing products that only proved the 'sunk cost fallacy' instead of investing where most of the money originated from. - High turnover of CEO's and C-suite employees. - High turnover in Support, Sales, Consulting, Technical Account Managers - Inability to retain top talent due to being underpaid by industry standard - Extremely prevalent 'Yes Man' culture once you get to Director or above (not in all cases, but many). CONS: New Leadership under Tom Krause ================================ - Mandatory RTO: those of us who did perform 100-150% when remote, were gaslit in the first GEM and made to believe that we were underperforming as a whole. Those of us who realized the benefits of working fully remote: less cost commuting, more time with family, a WAY better work-life balance are now all gone. However, the statstics that you can pull yourself using our own internal CRM system can prove that this was a minority of people. Many individuals were performing suboptimally, or barely hitting their KPI's. They were unresponsive, and some were blatantly caught working two jobs at the same time during the same hours (not moonlighting). This is first-hand experience, not me parrotting what someone else has said. - Engineering teams being treated as Support, makes it very hard to retain new talent in the Engineering spaces. They got hired to code, but are being used for Support purposes. - Sales have changed to prioritize the largest and above-the-line customers - Training content is also subpar for what we need. - Fatigued work-force (remnant from the old workforce, but makes people fatigued when the new processes from the new leadership come down the pipe). - New system software being used instead of the legacy software: Outlook replaced with Gmail, Teams replaced with Zoom. These are cost saving endeavors to avoid further layoffs, but these softwares are not enterprise ready and it makes your day to day harder to manage and organize. GMAIL is absolutely the worst offender of this due to how difficult it is to produce filters that make much sense.
The hours are very long
Could've had better team building experience. competition from bigger companies could be detrimental to future of company.
Worry of layoffs instead of work
Stagnant work environment, no room for promotions, company looking to sell off its pieces, not a good place to be right now.
Paid parking for employees. No meal subsidy
They took way too much business direct, a double edged sword on the sales culture. They had some unique opportunities to evolve their business models and the csuite sold everyone out. It's beyond tragic what happened to Citrix. The writing was on the wall a good 3 years before it came crashing down. Too many people got greedy and as a channel person, I observed very quickly sales started being dishonest and taking deals direct. And having experienced this at other companies, it ends the same way, not good.
Always changing and a severe lack of direction
CEO has a playbook that maximizes the business at the expense of the employee. He did it before, he'll do it again.

Always changing and a severe lack of direction
A lot of toxic work culture and politics.
- There doesn't seem to be an authentic caring about employees. - They are joining Citrix with TIBCO, yet no plan of how the 2 teams will work together technically. - Preference is given to TIBCO and their ""way"" even though they are half the size and were continually under-performing. - Making us use new software just to save a few dollars (i.e. Microsoft in favor of Google). It's embarrassing to use GMAIL as an Enterprise company. - They are following the Broadcom playbook as the CEO came from there. DO NOT work at Citrix (aka Cloud Software Group). - Feels like they are trying to sell things off and make Citrix just a niche corporation. Selling off Sharefile which is a tremendous part of the portfolio. - Merit Raises have been under inflation for 3 years now and now that there is no stock purchase plan, that is another 1.5% pay cut.
Recent re-org has things a little shaky however looks like things are going to improve. Company shake-up was unfortunate but needed and should se benefits in the coming year.
As a company transitions to cloud software group. There are some changes and lack of clarity.
The only con I would say is that promotion from Manager to Director (and above) is slow due to the lack of opportunity up top.
1. Best accounts are already picked over and handled by existing Citrix account managers. 2. Management plays favorites, especially in enterprise where sucking up is part of the game. Forced laughter at bad jokes by the managers and directors. 3. Somewhat of a bro culture.
Constant restructuring of the organization
location might be an issue
Used to have the culture of a start-up combined with all of the resources and opportunities of a corporate entity, but all budgets have been set to 0 and now all employees are ranked 1-3 every year (1 meaning high-performer, 2 on track, and 3 behind).
poor top level management. Yearly turnovers, very stressful
CEO thinks he's babysitting all day. RTO as mandatory is an incredibly non progressive move. Making software to allow people to work remotely and then not encouraging it? Treats everyone like they're toddlers. Compensation packages have become completely downgraded. Stay away from this company.
Sales model has morphed from a growth model focused on existing accounts and new logos, to a focus on the largest customers only.

- Cronyism and big boy mentality at the c-suite level causes the downfall of this great company - hiring of senior executive based on who you know rather that what you know
Disconnected Leadership. Ongoing Training. Transparency.

Disconnected Leadership. Ongoing Training. Transparency.
Limited support for some areas
New company is creating a culture of back stabbing and looking out for your self. Only 2 managers left and only 1 is good. That means many employees have no direct manager. Training is all recorded video based very boring and hard to follow. Don´t seam to care about employees or customers. Only concentrate on maximizing profits.
not much room for growth or mobility
Leadership has been terrible with the loss of Mark Templeton and since then the retirement of many of the senior sales leadership members.
Start-up mentality that may be preferential to some. Makes for an uncertain career path.
underpay compared to similar roles at competitor companies
- Corporate Strategy & Direction - Top heavy
Silicon Valley presence shrink w privatization
Leadership wasn't making good decisions for employees Leadership ignored complaints Decisions were made based on anything other than data
Stressful environment on closing decisions
Limited support for some areas
PE owned company that has changed culture
Minimal training. I'm a year in and every ticket I'm learning new parts of the code base and debugging/build tools. Makes things move very slowly
Poor experience with constant re-structuring and moving around between managers. Pay is very average and just does not cut it in a post 2020 world. Execs bringing everyone back into office so they can try and sell the building and make it look more productive. New CEO has very outdated mindset and most tech savvy employees were in disbelief with the things he would say during all hands meetings.
Not enough interaction with day to day business
Mandatory RTO 5 days a week (we didn't even have that prepandemic), treats us like children, comp based on unachievable goals that we absolutely won't hit, no adjustment for inflation, no career paths, overall just a miserable place to be
Lots of change happening constantly
- Required Return to Office 5 days a week - No accountability for leaders who are bullies
Support teams are understaffed and overworked. The sales teams (SMB & Commercial) were mostly laid off in early 2023. Forcing customer to go through partners.
Underpaid and overworked. Senior Directors and Managers who are barely present yet make decisions based on unreliable data, negatively impacting the business and employee’s livelihoods. Expense cutting resulted in zero growth opportunities for the last 3 years and counting. Recently bought out by another company and its future looks pretty bleak. Morale is at an all time low and resources are leaving in droves for better job opportunities at better paying companies .
location of offices compared to commute
Leadership is toxic, stay away, merger is horrible
Was a great company until the buyout and merger into Cloud Software Group. Focus now is on the top 1000 accounts world wide. They have reduced Development and R&D and I expect them to fall behind competitors with in 2-3 years.

Internal processes can be frustrating but that is any company in my opinion
Demanding Stressful at time Night shifts
Not enough interaction with day to day business
The pay could have been better
High Level Management changes direction every year or so which confuses employees and makes job security a worry.

A lot of recent changes, but it's a nice challenge
With the recent merger there have been layoffs.
Tts a Hard product to learn.
- Required Return to Office 5 days a week - No accountability for leaders who are bullies
Seen as more legacy player in the field, takes time to educate customers
-Was acquired by Tibco so there's been a lot of transition and overturn -Had made the work flow more difficult
Not found any so far

Nothing really to say bad about the company.
Near-term, the company will experience more changes than most people will be willing to tolerate. Taking a position with the company in 2022-2024 will be a gamble for new hires. Look before you leap.

How is it that a company that offers products that are designed specifically to allow remote work environments will no longer allows its own employees to work remotely beginning October 3, 2022? Do the new owners (hedge funds / private equity firms) not believe in what they're selling? Unless this is just a ploy to get employees to resign so that the company does not have to decide who to let go. The whole situation is just baffling to the entire staff.
They are following the Broadcom playbook as the CEO came from there. DO NOT work at Citrix.....Now called Cloud Software Group
Highly dysfunctional on the sales side.
Mandatory in-office 8-5, Monday through Friday. No flex, no hybrid. No PTO. Company just pulled all PTO, you have to ask your manager’s permission to take time off. If your manager “feels” it’s a good time for the business, then your granted time off. This is not unlimited PTO. This is no PTO.
lack of room to grow
competitive pressures, lack of common goals
NOTE: the CEO is not correct on Glassdoor. CEO since July of 2022 is Tom Krause. The below list of Cons are based on Tom Krause’s leadership as CEO. Lack of clear direction from CEO when making large announcement that impact employees, causing swirl and alternative narratives among teams. Absolutely no change management occurring during major acquisition between Citrix and TIBCO. Forced RTO that was expected to occur within two weeks of CEO announcement during all hands. Leadership reserves the right to formally request “Remote” employees transition to on-site at the discretion of their Manager. “You cannot get ahead in a job without showing up at the office” is the sentiments from Tom Krause who shared that in a global all hands meeting. So, that’s the company’s take on Remote vs On-Site employees. BEWARE joining Citrix as a “Remote” employee as there is a chance your Manager could u expectedly convert your arrangement. Employee benefits constantly changing and without clear direction. Change is quick and with no process or outlet to obtain clarity. CEO abruptly and without reason removed the last planned “Thank You Day” for Citrix employees AND the planned week-long holiday shutdown for TIBCO employees. Company is no longer employee facing and has exhibited a lack of concern for their well-being and an unstable environment. CEO changed PTO schedule and forcing all employees to use their accrued PTO within the next 60 days or lose the time by EOY. CEO has announced a new system which has yet to be revealed after several weeks of the initial announcement. CEO simply said the new process won’t require people to track their time off, but has not said it’s “unlimited” or “flex”, causing more swirl among the teams. Our own team did a pulse survey and PTO changes were the top concern mentioned.
It got acquired and the culture is declining due to attrition

My experience as a software engineer at Uber has been mostly positive. Uber provides high compensation and good benefits, the people are smart and supportive, and there is always work to be done. It is engaging. Like with many big companies, there is more work to be done than can get done. This is generally a good thing. It helps to stay engaged and to continually grow. The problem is when things try to move too fast and timelines, quality standards, and boundaries aren't managed correctly. Communicate well and it's overall a good situation.
Pretty comprehensive insurance and medical coverage. Very diverse staff and culture. Uber is always looking to be inclusive and strives to better its understanding of different cultures. Promotions are based on interviews, not just recommendations.
•Work when ever you want •Weekly payment •Car is Insured while on an order ($2,500 deductible) •Easy to learn •No co-workers, managers, etc.
This company has taken over for a long-standing Logistics company in Texas. His company tries his best to understand the needs of its employees and is very client centric. They have continuing Townhall style meetings to create dialogue around the challenges, advances, and successes of the company.
Global Reach: Uber operates in numerous cities and countries around the world. Working at Uber gives you the chance to be part of a global team, collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, and contribute to a truly international company. Career Growth: Uber offers a dynamic and fast-paced work environment that can lead to rapid career growth. With the company's rapid expansion and diverse range of business initiatives, there are often opportunities for advancement and the chance to take on new challenges. Flexible Work Arrangements: Uber, being a technology-driven platform, often offers flexible work arrangements, including the option to work remotely. This can be particularly appealing to those who value a work-life balance and the freedom to structure their workdays.

Uber has become a prime example of the gig economy at work. Uber's advantages include door-to-door convenience, safety, and reliable quality. Uber's disadvantages include its surge pricing and the negative effects of replacing steady jobs with gig work.

Nothing. This company is not a good one.
Great place for collaboration and bouncing ideas of each other.
Employee perks, ERG and benefits
Pick your own schedule is amazing
Some great people to work with
Employees are given training, attention, and a learning experience when onboarding and growing with the company. It's fast-paced and everyone is expected to keep up with any new changes in tech, policy, or procedures. There are great benefits, perks, and uber or tech ""swag."" The culture is fairly young and teams are fairly close.

Good company, good work life balance.
Great place to work within New Orleans
There is no review at the moment
You set your own hours, and can log off any time you want if you need a break. I’m disabled, so my hours (reflected in the pay I posted) are very part-time. I actually like this job a lot! And the low pay is only because I’m unable to work much.
Work life balance Great Leadership
","too much driving all day
The hours are much longer than any other job I've worked in, but this is expected to change as we continue hiring more help
Sometimes projects and initiatives try to move too fast and it comes at the cost of code quality and incidents. This isn't uncommon so just try to manage it, that's part of job anyway. I personally don't have an issue with the 50% RTO policy and code diff expectations. Some people do. Just gauge what type of situation you want and make a decision based on the facts.
Raises are only given in specific circumstances. Employees are told raises are based on the current market evaluation of the cost of living in your area, however, that doesn't seem to align with what is actually occurring. Luck of the draw with leadership. There are a lot of amazing leaders in Uber that want to let you succeed. But just as there are good leaders, you have leaders that are so far removed from the work or are completely out of scope with the team they are running, that it can feel aggravating to have to interact with them. Aligning my previous con with the promotions ""pro"" I gave, the interview process is also aggravating. It's up to the luck of draw on the interviewers you get. They will always be part of leadership of the team or a ""certified"" interviewer, but the different people/teams focus on different things. If you aren't great at interviews, it can be extremely difficult to move roles. And less than qualified individuals end up in a leadership role because they know how to interview well.
•Erratic earning potential •No guarantee of any orders •Terrible app (functionality, available information, goes offline frequently, places driver on “pause” for no reason, sends offers for food that has already been picked up by another driver or canceled, no way to email or send photos or videos) •Horrendous phone “support” from an undisclosed foreign country where English is not spoken or understood, unacceptable hold times, “accidental” disconnections, no follow-up, etc) •No training (some silly, time waster slides with no actual instructions) •Willy-nilly updates, usually with no explanation
The transportation and logistics industry is constantly shifting and sending based on federal and state policies, as well as the rising cost of fuel. It is challenging to move freight at this time and companies like Uber feel it. At times, decisions are made prior to getting input by those that have to directly feel the effects managerial policies.
Workload and Stress: Depending on the role, employees at Uber might experience high workloads and stressful conditions, especially during peak times or when dealing with customer service issues. The fast-paced and dynamic nature of the company's operations can lead to burnout for some individuals. Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Uber operates in a complex regulatory environment, and the company has faced legal challenges and disputes in various locations around the world. This can lead to uncertainty and potential disruptions in the company's operations. Job Security: The nature of the gig economy means that drivers and other gig workers might not have the same job security as traditional full-time employees. Changes in demand, shifts in business strategy, or regulatory issues can impact their income and stability.
Income fluctuates, a lot of driving somedays to reach income goals , must withhold your own tax % every year
Ride offers are insultingly low pay. Cost of maintenance is expensive. Hertz rental program is unorganized, lack of availability and expensive. Long hours yield less and less pay each year. Depreciation of your own vehicle. This job puts you at constant risk from drunk drivers, texting and driving, road debris, potholes, industrial accidents, dangerous neighborhoods and vehicle theft/armed robbery for very little pay. Company will deactivate you even with dash cam footage in most cases. Work/life balance at the full-time level manipulated by impossible bonus goals.
After layoffs- I'm exhaused. My workload is almost double, while my bonus is a fraction of what it should be. Goals are unattainable- and most teams are hitting 35-70% of plan. Some changes next year will cause medical benefits to increase $2K+ year, and we are losing other job perks which are close to $5K of income.
-inconsistent wages -horrific communication with support -unnecessary and excessive reviews
- cliquey team - lots of action, not a lot of thought - everyone is fighting for visibility, less focus on what actually would be useful
The cost of driving to your destination or pickup is not factored in. The driver looses any profits made when returning back from a long distance drop off and returning back to their starting point. If the drop off destination takes the driver far from their home or to an undesirable area the profits made from the trip is used on the return trip. The driver loses time and money on the return trip back to the original starting point. Uber only offers rental car discounts in certain areas. Boost incentives are not available in all areas. They are only available in major cities which are two hours away from my address!!
The first job I ever had that severely impacted my mental health so much that unaliving myself was a more viable option than continuing with this job. No work/life balance because of the work schedule. Forget holiday breaks because you have to work every single holiday no matter what. No one took vacation time because there was very little PTO hours available. Company culture felt so toxic. People were cliquey among teams. Little room for advancement or growth. Management sets strict policies regarding attendance and performance, but doesn't explain the policies or have them clearly stated anywhere. You don't find out crucial information that impacts you until it's too late to take any progressive action about it.

They only pay you about 4$ an hour and hope that you get good tips to meet the expected delivery total. Honestly, they are a scam. Giving drivers less deliveries if they decline low orders. These low orders will say ""estimated total, $2.50"" for a 30 minute trip. They only pay you about 30% of the total and it's honestly super sad.
Uber doesn't care about the ppl that drive for them. It's all about what they can keep gaining financially out of you. The Customer Sevice is terrible and repetitive. Uber will issue $2 orders while they collect the majority of the money. I had a $70 order, only received a $4 earning from it. Uber wants you to drive for miles for these type of orders. Now in the beginning, they were being fair, but now it's greed. They are only worrying about how they collect from it. This point system they go by, is what Uber use to keep you in a ""certain range"". If your points get too low, they use it against you and your earnings. They do not keep the drivers or riders updated with any new information. Uber is not supportive at all. Beware before you put your car on the road. Customer service is very terrible, they will constantly talk verbatim, I'm sorry, I understand, blah blah blah.
Have not encountered any cons so far.
Pay has gotten really bad, currently you'd be lucky to make $20/h minus gas, tolls, car maintenance. So more like $12-15/h until you get into a big wreck. Your not payed for the extra miles unless you drive 40+ miles, and it doesn't increase by much. As the economy gets worse you'll either be payed the same or less. No boss, but you speak to the same outsourced call centers customers have to deal with, not very helpful when you have real issues like with pay, lack of rides, or issues with promotions. Promotions are almost non existent, they used to pay double or sometimes more 3 years back. I've heard it was even better years before I started. Currently they're rare to even find and pay very little for a short amount of time. Scummy tactics, for example: you're being told that you're being payed $4.50 for a 16 min ride with a promotion of $2, figure out there's a $1.05 toll (which is reimbursed), so the ride is already paying you about $13/h but they're telling you without the promotion you would have been payed $5.35/h. Real life example, I have the screenshots and reported it to Uber, still happens and I've learned to try to outsmart the system by not taking tolls if the pay doesn't make sense, which still nets you about $18/h. (1y ago) Wasn't able to get promotions at all, confirmed my friends still had promotions, called Uber about 15 times and was told it's not my fault and they'll make a report. Promotions randomly came back 5 months later. Currently I'm just not getting rides, so I'm just doing Lyft, which isn't much better, until I get a real job. If you work non stop for +50 hours a week for about 6 months you'll get to diamond rank which gives you a +$400 bonus, however stray from that at all and you'll start at level 1 again. Reached platinum after working like a slave, then said no to a few to many rides and I was put all the way back to blue rank (the lowest one) as if this is some video game and not a livelihood. There's so many Uber drivers that not just there's competition but there's no incentive to increase pay cause there's so many people working for Uber, mostly immigrants (I've been told by most of the tourists who're so happy to see that I speak English) A union is unlikely since Uber is in high demand and they can just threaten to leave the state if they try to make one.

Lack of consistent pay due to the nature of the job can be inconvenient to make a steady income. Occasionally the in-app GPS has issues navigating certain areas, but I can use other apps to make up for that.
quota is way too high

Customer service isn’t alway great, sometimes u get stuck on a ride and can’t do the next order.?then u try to call the help number but it’s covered with the address so no help till u get home and figure it out
Very political, leadership taking bad decision due to information asymmetry
Not a full time job
Work is much less exciting than it used to be. Leadership is less dynamic.
Need a car with insurance Pay your own gas Lots of driving
Needs up charge over 3-5mile radius
They don’t care about you (the driver), don’t waist your time try to fight back a customer, just smile and let it go, because if an issue escalate they will never consider the time you’ve worked for them being a good driver with good ratings and comments but they pick the customers side and deactivate your account!
Compensation was below market. Overall company did not manage people well and many managers should have been individual contributors or were in the wrong roles, for example, most of the time there were 2-4 of the same projects being worked on by different teams that were not communicating - effectively creating paralyzing conflict - chaos. Team members were shuffled around based on team need, rather than aligned with skills and experience. Company was also plagued by constant employee turnover.
Tips aren’t that big, make sure you have enough money to support your gas tank .
Unsafe, cars will get damages, high mileage, harassment/verbal abuse, trip bonuses are very hard to reach after these recent years

quota is way too high
Increased competition among driver The need to maintain a vehicle that meets Uber's standards The possibility of receiving negative reviews Expenses for gas, maintenance, and insurance Uncertainty about the payment rate for each ride
Poor support - they don't compensate for canceled orders if the restaurant is closed. Earlier they did that. Your salary depends on customers, and sometimes they're willing to pay $5 for half an hour of your time. It's ridiculous. Yes, you can cancel these orders, but there is no guarantee that you get a better one. You can stuck without orders at all.

Difficult to get out of customer support if that is what you have been hired into
They accused me of fraudulent activity on my own account and revoked my privilege to drive for them… they said my face isn’t actually my face 😐 horrible company and very bad customer service.
Need a car with insurance Pay your own gas Lots of driving
Needs up charge over 3-5mile radius
Lots of changes -too many at once at times
It is too difficult to grow inside the company
They take almost 50% of what they say you’re going to make on each delivery. “FEES” they say. They also don’t just keep you in the same area. You might have a 45 minute drive back from your last delivery.
Money bonuses and tips are inconsistent. Long hours.
A little too corporate, which was annoying - company wide processes and all-hands meetings that had nothing to do with my project.
-- Unpredictable changes in organizational hierarchy

Terrible leadership, you're just a number, revolving door
Management sucks by all means
Shaky leadership, not a lot of upside on stocks overall though last one year has seen 100% gain. Compulsory RTO, diff count tracking etc
Never knowing how much money you’re going home with for the day. Some days are better than others. Has slowed down a lot in the last year. Too many drivers out on the road.
There's no guaranteed wage a even on days where it's projected to be busy you could end up bringing home nothing. With the cost of gas going up it is extremely difficult to break even.
quota is always evolving, sometimes posted days after the month starts so always be on your game, high turnover for those who can't meet quota, difficult path to promotion
Gas prices can take away from income when they are high
No 401K matching, some lackluster leaders
Uber and Lyft need to more moneys to drivers
Didn’t have , its a good company
Politics, and poor leadership all around.
Everything!!! GPS is out of wack, listening to customer before asking delivery driver, and the list go on
Rates have been declining for drivers but going up fr passengers.
Having to pay for your own gas and people sometimes don’t tip
The combination with Transplace has been a mess internally, and we’ve lost many senior leaders to competitors or retirement in the last few months. Ask how your employees are doing, and their feedback as to how we can clean up inside our walls and scale.
Not much better than regular minimum wage job when you consider wear and tear, car upkeep, crazy gas prices.
- Low on-demand in orders in some periods of time - Mileage will go up
I honestly have no complaints about working here.
Not many cons for this company.

Laid me me off and i would still return
Large company. Currently doing layoffs
Hardworking teammates may be stressful
Use own vehicle to drive

Not much room for growth.
Salary is the biggest issue with working for Uber Corporate
No benefits or insurance of course
Tends to be too productivity driven. Not great at resolutions
As an Xpert, you're a face representing uber and interacting with drivers that come in person searching for answers, solutions, or a quick coffee stop. Aside from building relationships with drivers, you'll also experience angry-stressed uber ""partners"" that you'll learn to calm-de-escalate through solutions and social skills.
sometimes its busy other times it not no way to predict income
You dont get paid for the time it takes to go get your passenger even if its 20 min away. They also try to trick you into thinking they did by showing you how much you made per hour but the pick up and idle times arent included in the calculation and is usually exactlt half of your day. Every time you accept a trip that pays a few cents less, because you dont want to be just sitting there, Uber will offer less and less per trip. I started at $1 a mile and now Im at half that and the gas costs more.
Sometimes the volume of orders is ow and affects your time and can be frustrating
unrealistic goals. Unfair management. No one goes to the office
Little passenger opportunities due to large amount of new Uber drivers on the road. Uber takes a large percentage of your fare.
-low pay -commission structure changes every month
too much driving all day
limited work hours for schedule
Intoxicated individuals, not completely safe
None at the moment that I can think of
Not many cons for this company.
An accurate review will be updated later
You can go hours with no pings if it’s a slow day.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Harris-Teeter-Reviews-E18182.htm,"Flexible schedule, easy going low pressure environment.
I enjoy the work I do and a lot of what I do. Great people for the most part to work with. Flexible with hours and time off. A great platform to work in. Good values in the workplace as well as a good foundation for how work should be done.
My co-worker gets away with only showing up for about half of his shifts so if you don't like working on certain days or have last second plans, just don't show up and there will likely not be any consequences.
I enjoy most of the people I work with. My Customer Service Manager is great. Always there to talk and help out. I get along with my Customer Service clerks, cashiers, and baggers. We can all joke and have a good time while continuing to get the job done. Overall the customers are great.
the only way i could be happy with my hair right about this moment was to have it done with my own hands instead

The job is very very easy and the pay was not bad. regular raises. doesn't take a lot of brain power
Enjoyable position for a time job. Would have liked to have more support.

This position was full time.
","People slow to come back
Management of resources is out of control bad. Equipment is hardly working and company refusal to spend money to fix things. Upper management litterally acts like they care, but they don't. Management has no idea what a day-to-day workload looks like and causes them to look foolish when they ask when things aren't done. Micromanagement is minimal but completely Uncalled for when it does happen, see above point. Customers get whatever they want no matter the cost. Management has no backbone and gives in even when a customer is wrong. Pay is non competitive or at least it feels that way.
Overworked, underpaid, not enough employees because of those things mainly. Anybody who tries to get their job done with the lack of resources will quickly leave or give up once they realize they are being taken advantage of. My day consists of being used and abused by management and costumers being rude that we can't do something because of lack of inventory or the people to get it done. Nothing can or will be changed because the management doesn't know how to solve issues. Expect to be working alone for many of your shifts with a work load designed for 3 people minimum.
The Store Diractor is hard to get along with. I don't know if it is company wide but my store seems to be cutting hours for current employees but still hiring for those same jobs. Sometimes customers can be hard to get a long with but not to bad.
the only way i could be happy with my hair right about this moment was
Lot's of work. Understaffed, expect to be frequently assigned to cover 2 or more isles in 1 night.
Nothing really it was great
While there is potential to make good money, hardworking employees are often rewarded with more responsibilities, with false promise of a raise or promotion. I've heard that promised raises will happen eventually, but not until its a day late and a dollar short.
Your offer letter states that you will work anywhere up to 50 miles from your home. It never occurred to me that living in a major metropolitan area, with 3 Harris teeters within less than 1 mile from my home and tens more less than 10 miles, I would be placed out in FarFax 18 miles away. My training store was in the city of Falls Church, less than 5 miles and 15 mins. Every single manager I complained to or talked to about it, told me they were driving 45 minutes up to 2 hours ONE WAY to work, passing countless stores on their way in. That is unfair and it is dumb. Why wouldn't you want your employees to be part of the community they serve?
I don’t like retail so it really isn’t rewarding
Not paid enough. Not much help.
The pay is really bad compared to what everyone else was getting. It sometimes feels like they have nobody working the other positions because I frequently get asked to do pretty much everything it's kinda crazy.
Low pay. Work can get tedious. At closing time, business is slow so you end up doing nothing for minutes
No such thing as a merit increase or performance based raise. Pay raises are strictly given annually
A few of the managers there aren’t the nicest
0 work/life balance due to staff shortages. 70+ hour weeks
Not enough employees in the deli, I was expected to do breakfast sandwiches , morning deli sub station prep,make to go sandwiches and salads, platter orders to prep, slice deli items for customers all at the same time when arriving for my morning shift , impossible to do by myself even sometimes with two people. When I left so did many other employees and managers at the time. They also don't pay well only had a 10 cent raise in two years.
Low pay, managers cannot agree on one goal, management actively works against each other, supermarket not robust against general market pressures (I'm sorry, ma'am, the item you want is not in stock today), training non-existent, items on shelves not rotated, employees not given a fair shake, etc, etc
no cons as of now
Management kind of sucks, very laid back but that can be a con or a pro, up to you...
Low pay and lots of expectation.
Younger generation has no work ethic.
Managers will never call you or return your phone call when you’re trying to find out about training. Constantly getting the run around
-lack of coaching and consistency amongst floral program between stores and districts -upper management often misjudging SWAT through a lack of understanding of needs of floral department (ordering, storage, maintaining product integrity) -lack of streamlined expectation between stores within the brand -many managers taking advantage of differently abled employees- should be a program in place to oversee this and help advocate for uniquely abled employees -many lower level managers punish integrity , rather than value it
It can be annoying at times
long shifts,would make you work 24/7 if they could
Beware of a couple managers there who are notorious for gossiping. They are far worse than employees.
Required to work holidays which most would expect
benefit package could be better
Management not good, hard to take time off
Management kind of sucks, very laid back but that can be a con or a pro, up to you...
Terrible equipment, horrible management, fluctuating paycheck sometimes as a result of the first 2, not rewarding to stay for long.
Management doesn’t care how many hours, without help, as long as the job gets done.
Low pay and lots of expectation.
Very busy, high stress job
Younger generation has no work ethic.
The pay and compensation was low for the area i worked in, asked for a lot without wanting to give the pay
Everything including management. Only 30 minutes for lunch
Corporate management doesn't seem to care for their employees. We're just numbers on a spreadsheet to them. The bottom line and profitability is the only thing that matters. Workload for a deli manager can be unrealistic at times. You will need to work harder than anyone in the store just to try an meet expectations. Plan on being under staffed nearly year round.
Unrealistic goals set up by management. I worked for the company for more than 13 years and I was grateful for the opportunity. I had many chances to meet great store and district managers who showed me how to lead and manage. However, if you had a boss who did not know how to lead ,was lazy and demanding, as in my case in the last 5 years I was there, find a way to transfer to a different district or store. My DM would never be at the store or pharmacy whenever we had inventory which is unheard of. I worked for Giant for 5 years and I had a different DM before her, they were ALWAYS present when we had any big or important events. I am not here to be ungrateful to those who helped me to be where I am today. I do miss my days working at HT. I was a manager from the start and worked all the way until my Mom passed away then decided to step down. At the time I asked for extra time off but was not approved so I decided to step down and eventually let go a few months after stepping down . I am in a better place now and I am doing well. I just hope my colleagues will not have to experience what I experienced and I hope when you decide to work for the company , luck will be on your side in terms of having a good DM who also knows how to lead.
Nothing negative to say now
Having more hours would be nice but online shopping is more limited than other jobs.
The work was boring, and I didn't feel like I was doing very much.
Not as organized as I would have liked.
Non competitive pay, on call days
The pay could be better
Overtime thru the roof, Management sometimes doesn’t listen
Oh where to begin? ~Pay is crap. They don't care about how much they use you in different departments. Pay was low and sometimes lower than others when you've been there longer. ~Tried going into management but got kicked out of the system even though I had great remarks and several managers asking me to apply to be one. ~ In a months span 4 different people in my department called out, but when I did because I was puking I got denied and was told to cook people food (thankfully it was only food poisoning). ~Got a part time seasonal job asked my department manager if I could call out for one night only since it was going to be a long day at the other job didn't think I could make it in since i was scheduled for both the same day. She said that was fine she over staffed that day anyways admitted she accidentally put me on for that night. Next day to work was called in early to help with inventory in another department and the store manager said ""IF she comes in"". I laughed since I gave them 3 years of my loyalty. Quit that night which my seasonal job became my full time which lead me to where I am now.
Controlled overhead by Kroger ; evasive management for pay raises ; expanded roles but not pay
They have proper protection gear but they don't give it to you unless you ask.
You’re on call which is extremely inconvenient
I am not a fan of retail hours.
Short breaks, less than 15 mins
But it all comes down to who your manager is. We were short-staffed and management did not make clear up front the expectations on finishing before the store opened. There are issues of scale at this specific store. It was never built to handle as much product as it did.
Management sucks on the store level
Lots of turnover with part time employees
A lot of stuff , managers not caring and understaffed
The management and organization was all very poorly managed and handled. The company also underpaid it's employees while the cost of living rose.
Very understaffed, new workers will leave with short notice.
I do not have any now.
Unrealistic goals set up by management. I worked for the company for more than 13 years and I was grateful for the opportunity. I had many chances to meet great store and district managers who showed me how to lead and manage. However, if you had a boss who did not know how to lead ,was lazy and demanding, as in my case in the last 5 years I was there, find a way to transfer to a different district or store. My DM would never be at the store or pharmacy whenever we had inventory which is unheard of. I worked for Giant for 5 years and I had a different DM before her, they were ALWAYS present when we had any big or important events. I am not here to be ungrateful to those who helped me to be where I am today. I do miss my days working at HT. I was a manager from the start and worked all the way until my Mom passed away then decided to step down. At the time I asked for extra time off but was not approved so I decided to step down and eventually let go a few months after stepping down . I am in a better place now and I am doing well. I just hope my colleagues will not have to experience what I experienced and I hope when you decide to work for the company , luck will be on your side in terms of having a good DM who also knows how to lead.
You will be working with people who probably don't care too much about their job so you'll most likely have to deal with lazy or stubborn co-workers which can be a bit difficult every now and again.
I cannot think of any now.
Workers receive low salaries unless manager
Don't work a harris teeter
-Will get pretty mundane after a while unless your into retail jobs -Occasional Holiday and Sunday Rush
Sometimes management was more concerned with satisfying corporate.
Not a lot of one on one training some bad attitudes
- they only let 1 person be full time - so you get like 30 hours a week - at the end of the day I would bring home $54 😭 - everyday you have to redo the exact same stuff but there are always new problems - the staff were either depressed or complained a lot - you'd get karens everyday - if it rains you will have to deal with being wet all day - you have to clean the entire store - you are given too many tasks but not enough time to do them properly - they only keep a minimal amount of people working at a time so there's never enough people to actually complete everything so a manager ends up having to work longer to finish it all
You get limited technician help. It is based on the number of scripts filled.
No teamwork. Everyone is for themselves
Increased expectations with minimal support.
reorganization a lot of changes all at once not all for the better
Lots of work for not much money
I don't have any cons.
No cons from my experience

Hard to get raises. Holidays and Weekends required.
A lot of stuff , managers not caring and understaffed
The management and organization was all very poorly managed and handled. The company also underpaid it's employees while the cost of living rose.
Breaks could be a bit longer (15mins for shifts as long as 6hrs), can be slightly overwhelming if too few other baggers are present.
Get better with the policies
Management sometimes could not be as helpful
Not all people working there are nice
some things the store takes seriously like theft and alcohol sales are unfairly blamed on young cashiers who are literal teenagers not well trained on these issues.
Very little hands on training for the amount of things the bakery area is expected to cover.
1). Management for a big Corporation is as predictable as it gets, treating you like a wage slave- expecting YOU to cover shifts for other people or mess-ups THEY do. As a side-note, they DO NOT post any wages on any advertisements(I mean look on Indeed.com, it's honestly funny). On top of that, as you're being interviewed, nothing is said about your wages- they just expect you to guess/not give a crap about YOUR WAGES. 2). Highly manipulative Management Team, very uppity and bubbly but in reality they want nothing to do with you and expect you to go above and beyond for nothing in return. 3). This goes for any of the roles, but especially for Deli workers and Meat Clerks; You don't get 'taught' anything, they show you the bare bone-basics of where everything is, then send you on their marry way. You're then expected to learn everything there-after. 4). As an Employee, an Associate - Management EXPECTS you to do petty tasks without and reassurance that you're doing good work. They just kind of want you to do needless tasks to cover their own butts. If you have question these tasks or ask them why your the one to do said petty tasks, you'll either be shamed or you'll be one foot closer out the door. They give you these responses typically, on the line of, ""You have a job, do IT"" or ""Because it's your job"" - kind of attitude. 4). This ONLY applies to Meat Clerk and """"being risen"""" up to be given the opportunity to use the Slicer for the Meat Department. But THEY WILL try to manipulate your current drama-infested situation into a position that is A) Worse or B) Completely screw you with a contract that FORCES you to stay there for a guaranteed 2 years. Unless you want to cough out $10,000. 5). Your Management Team will be constantly over your shoulders on Mystery Shops, expecting perfect 100% every single time. So help you god, if you mess-up one Mystery Shop, they'll be one your case about it instantly OR they will use that AGAINST you for any further raises. Possibly both depending on your Manager.
Poor management. Management don’t really care. employees do whatever they want.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TaskUs-Reviews-E350702.htm,"Awesome workplace! I enjoy going to work everyday.
* People are friendly from Operation Managers, TL, QA's, Trainer and Co-teammates * Food forward really helps people minimize their day to day expenses. * the activities and events are well thought. * TaskUs as much as possible is trying to meet the employees request to further increase its credibility and empowering their ""People First"" Value. as of the moment this will be the only thing i can say for TaskUs, since i haven't been that long for TaskUs. i'm still feeling what kind of company is TaskUs. i will update this in the future
- Unlimited PTO out the gate - Fair pay - Livable pay - High commission earning potential - Lots of room to move up in the company in sales - I feel cared about and important here - Senior leadership and management is awesome - My direct manager is awesome - Our service is great and I can actually believe in what I'm selling - lots of creative license into how you sell
- The insurance is pretty good. - The people are great for the most part.
Their tagline is ""people first"" which is evident from their care to its employees.
I loved the environment that Taskus provided
I was able to use the experience I got from TaskUs to get a job that pays 51% better.
They do offer some work from home campaigns which is really nice if that works best for your life right now/in general. You also meet some very nice people you wouldn't have interacted with otherwise. Equipment provided. The pto policy is pretty nice too.
The work environment is great. Not to mention the benefits. The people are nice too. Overall, it's really great.
WFH, that’s about it. Nice coworkers.

Low salary packages that does not coincide with the inflation rate.
Laid back atmosphere Facilities is being run by some awesome dudes One HR rep truly cared about the employees Dress code is basically don’t show your bits Insurance is some of the best around. If you get with the right OM, they’ll show you what true leadership is. I was fortunate to have an amazing OM.
Work from home is convenient
Diverse company Opportunity for growth They are supportive of your needs and wants throughout the work day and also with HR Great teamwork on teams It's nice to have weekly progress and improvement reports
Flexible, wfh options, great pay, great benefits, and ridiculous colleagues.
They provide equal opportunity to everybody, I love the benefits as well as the care the company gives to its people.
Made some money while I worked there
Great people Will work with you Unpaid time off Pto Birthday pto

task us ist a company that offers plenty of options for there employees to grow and learn. many protection that help us take care of our own safety
Used to be a good place to work.
Don't have to speak to customers or do any physical labor.
Positive culture and environment that's why I joined Taskus
Some really great people - and international employee based compromised mostly of honest and genuine teammates.
Easy goung and understanding HR
Everything was so fun, the people help a lot to create a good environment, the information and the processes were explained in the best way, I gotta say I will miss this training since it has been probably the better training experience I ever had
Benefits are average compared to other companies.
The teammates are amazing! I did learn a lot during my almost 4 years here.
Good pay and benefits.. what else matters?
Taskus is perfect where we can achieve more growth
- Pay is quite good for the position - Set hours to a weekly schedule Monday through Friday
Work can be fun & inviting some days.
TaskUs has provided me with a warm welcome and my supervisor Jordan has been nothing but helpful and encouraging! Learning about the opportunities for growth as a BDR promotes an exciting environment.
Easy to advance quickly if you want to
Had good work times and holidays paid
Pay, environment, employee appreciation, end of year party
Great acceptance of people of all backgrounds.
working at task us in a great environment and lots of fun.
Working here in TaskUs so far is great, a people first company.
Diversity and inclusion, great clients, benefits and salaries are above the average.
Learn a lot in small amount of time. Pushes your limits to be self reliant and be creative in problem solving
pto would be if you didn't have to get approval to use your time how you would like to
Great people all around you. Really get to be yourself while still having that professional environment. They are all about growth as a company but also as an individual! They truly care for their employees.
Lots of folks care. Like sincerely care, not just about the needs of the business but about the people of the campaign. Jon King is the best part about TaskUs. TaskUs will give you the tools, connections, and experience to grow your career. If you view it as a stepping stone, it does its job. If you give it your all, you'll leave disappointed.
Nice people to work with.
TaskUs is an okay place to get in entry level - you can get promoted from teammate to TL quickly. Bigger campaigns are usually easier to do this with in some ways. Really small campaigns are not.
Good place to be, you can feel save to be yourself, good organization in the events, good equipment, comfortable work settle.

TaskUs is more focused on meeting clients' demands than on ensuring the well-being of their workforce.
The pros of taskus is that they are able to allow people who don't have past experience. There are benefits that other company don't have. Free food and good environment.
Working culture is too good
Met some amazing ppl there!
Decent pay and very cool work environments..!!!
wonderful opportunities for some campaigns. People-first is honored for day-to-day needs such as appointments, and PTO. A generally respectful culture exists, friendly staff and team management.
The company has employee diversity.
The company itself is good, good starting salary for newbies, with a clear career path pushed by the company
With a span of 6 months working here in Taskus, I have witnessed how Taskus embodied their culture and prove to us employees that they are really a People First company. As an employee of Taskus, I can see potential career growth here not only because of the management who continuosly encourages and supports the employees but also because of the good incentives and benefits they offer, the employees will be motivated to do their job well.
WFH was great! Super lenient, great work home balance. Team leads were awesome!
Incredible culture, fair benefits, competitive pay, and a family-like team!
Handy skill development, cool coworkers

","needs a proper smoking area though.
* training is a bit rushed, training should have more time or days. especially for those campaign who have a lot of information that is needed much more attention. * for recruitment team, there should always be an assessment for every campaign regardless if they're from external or internal hires. because this is a serious matter and will affect the capabilities of any individual working for TaskUs. they should always check the skills set of any individual and must always put the individual to a particular campaign that is within their skills and capability. not just because they needed the man power to a particular campaign. so in this way it will decrease the turn-over rate of the company. * tools and equipment should always be the priority especially before training. it is a challenge for both trainers and trainees to understand the campaign. as of the moment this will be the only thing i can say for TaskUs, since i haven't been that long for TaskUs. i'm still feeling what kind of company is TaskUs. i will update this in the future
- After going public lots of stakeholders want to put their input in now
- They don't believe in raises, never received a raise in my 4yrs there. - Lied about permanent remote jobs, more than a hand full of coworkers stated they were promised remote position. - they let the campaigns take the reins in how they see fit. - Out sourcing jobs across the globe, casing people to be without a job. - Management is NOT organized at all.
Since I'm newly hired to this company, it's kinda disappointing when our wave have to be reprofiled to another account due to some reasons.
There was no room for promotions or pay raises depending on the campaign you were assigned to. Lack of communication between management. always changing QA metrics.
Everything. The company routinely lies to its employees. They guarantee things and then backtrack and gaslight you when questioned. Their “management” are people they picked up off the side of the road. They fake Glassdoor reviews (if you don’t believe me, filter by most recent and see how many glowing 5 star reviews they have on a daily basis from the Philippines…) I had hindsight advantage enough to know that my friends/family that worked here had stolen wages when attempting to quit. For those not in the know, if you try and leave TaskUs, they will send you an email/letter saying you have X amount of days to follow their demands or they will reduce your already terrible wage to minimum wage. I’ve met people who gave into these demands and got minimum wage anyways. My advice? Don’t give them two weeks noticed, just stop showing up because their NDA doesn’t let them disclose this to other jobs, and don’t return the equipment to them. Make them come pick it up. And don’t sign anything. Overall, TaskUs will go down as the worse company I’ve ever worked for, and I think it would be impossible to match. Ignore every 4-5 star reviews because they’re either outright fake, or exaggerated by the people TaskUs deems are “worthy” enough. Filter by the 1-3 stars and you’ll get more in-depth responses to what I’m saying here.
No job security, no transparency or honesty from management, the clients of each campaign have the power to make your life living hell if they want and no one will stop them. No matter how valid or legitimate the complaint or concern, you're dismissed and gaslit. Somehow it's always your fault and something you can do better. But if you do well, you'll only be rewarded with more work for no extra pay. And if you have an issue that just impacts you management will not do anything about it unless you constantly nag them. It's fine for a transitional job, or for a chapter in your life. But I don't know a single truly happy employee. Stay as long as you need/can and look for better elsewhere.
I just have a problem with the sudden changes in schedules. Sometimes, it takes too long for schedule swapping.
Management is severely lacking in ownership, empathy, & protecting their staff. HR is full of bitter, hateful people who like to attack anyone with a problem. Benefits are poor & cost too much. Getting a raise here, even when promoted, is near impossible. You get told you’re already making too much, so they give you a tiny “bonus” instead.

Depending on the campaign you are going to work on, you are not able to take your holiday off, in addition, you are not allowed to take your holiday on another day. You will need to use your PTOs to enjoy your holidays and this is not told to you during the interview process. If you take PTO on all federal holidays, you will have almost no PTO days left during the year. No bonus or compensation for yours efforts.
Lack of communication, campaigns can shut down on a whim without as much as a warning leaving dozens without a job
- Team members were told they would get amazon gift cards as an award for performance. Never got them 6 months later or ever. - Require you to rate them on glassdoor during onboarding to give them positive reviews. - Low pay - Very little chance for advancement or/and pay raise. - To be team leader, you need 1 years of leadership + degree for 40k. - Several campaign closures so you never know if your campaign is next with little chance of being moved to different campaign. - Too many different systems for everything that leave you confused with obsolete systems still available (ie - Pay, benefits, schedule, time off, IT support, HR, etc) - Leadership will ignore you and promise they look into incidents and HR will not follow up with you about EEO complaints.
Share price (and vesting share based compensation) have suffered recently.
The hours can sometimes me off
not really much i can say negative about the company.
Listen, I understand landing a job here out of necessity. But please, please don't stop job hunting after being hired. This place is not a job. It is not sustainable. They are fully aware of it; they don't care. The attrition is literally built into their business model. Don't try to be the difference here. It is a necessary pitstop, but you still need to keep working on applying elsewhere to get out of this place. Do not let yourself get complacent. I truly don't have enough bad things to say about this company. ""People first"" is a lie. It's a scam to you and a scam to the clients. They bend over backwards for clients with absolutely zero consideration or advocacy for their team. They charge their clients so much, and absolutely none of it trickles down. Employee's don't need free coffee or pool tables; they need livable wages. Please don't let yourself get comfortable enough to settle, because this place will neverrrr pay you enough to live on.
Micromanage for remote Team leads vary widely
Low compensation considering the work required per day
Where to begin. TaskUS has a company ""pillar"" about radical candor and truth that they boast about when they hire new people. This could not be further from the truth. The upper management constantly lies about its daily practices CONSTANTLY. When they would hand out ""merit bonuses"" (it's in quotes because they made it seem like 1-2% after 2 years is such a gift), they would tell us it was based on reviews, yet team members who had the same scores would get differing amounts. And if you fell into the mid-level management group, your expectation is to agree with everything and follow blindly or face consequences or even termination. They do NOT like any kind of free thinking so beware. They micromanage EVERY part(and I mean every hour) of your work day life and make threats if you don't fall into line. The culture is non-existent and tone deaf. Even when attempts are made, the teams are so afraid to say something wrong, even in a team building environment, that it becomes uncomfortable and anxiety-filled.
Training needs work Getting to know the platform needs work Study Material needs work
attendance policy is trash, no sick leave Leadership is uneducated on policies and as a result you can end up on a final warning/termination. They play around too much with bereavement. when I first started here my cousin passed away and I was denied bereavement and about 6 month later a friend of mine cousin passed away and she got approved for bereavement. This past week my dad passed away and leading up to it I was led on to believe that I have job security to help guide my dad as he declined. I was met with a final attendance warning and then when my dad actually passed away I was told I had to come into work the next day and apply for bereavement and if I did not have time off to cover the time requested I will be terminated. There not very much room to move up and that says a lot because they regularly purge people and blame ""company downsizing"" (RIP the training department.)
Try to increase the salary cap or give additional allowances to entice retention of good agents
Super shady management Leads were asked to lie and say they rated their employees lower than they did by the site vp Would not answer questions about severance in writing Very difficult to get in touch with anyone after leaving the company even in regards to company related questions Several people working at this site are on government assistance because pay does not match the cost of living for the city, meanwhile Bryce is sending out company wide emails talking about record profits This site has no child care, several campaigns are leaving, and as mentioned above, the pay is not near enough for the area. However, the very first thing you’ll see upon walking in to the building is two large televisions playing videos about all the perks (childcare etc) in the newer sites being built overseas. Talk about a slap in the face.
No raises for employees even tenured
TaskUs is supportive but their contracts with certain clients are not so much. Even when doing a service or working with big business names, they do not have specific protections for you when interacting with these clients. Bad attitudes at some points are to be expected, but once a company has shown you that it's their culture to underpay and stretch their employees thin that is not a recipe for retention. No one is dealing with that environment while also being underpaid and it's not the employee's responsibility to work harder for a $15-$25 gift card to anywhere.
I don't think TaskUs has any cons.
I haven't experienced any downside yet.
The absence of consistent employee loyalty and longevity was evident as campaigns were shifted overseas, resulting in frequent reassignments. This led to workforce uncertainty and instability, with layoffs, favoritism, and push-outs not uncommon. Toxicity permeated Human Resources, Team Leads, Recruiting, and Management. Finding supportive and effective Team Leads proved challenging due to detrimental behaviors affecting team morale and productivity. Instances of gossip, rumor-mongering, and toxic behaviors fostered a distrusting and disillusioned atmosphere, negatively impacting team spirit and employee well-being.
My only bc was working nights
In my opinion the small and only inconvenience task us can have is the schedule, because i study and work at the same time and if they had a half time it would work better for me.
Without proper on boarding process, a person might get overwhelmed and will probably end up adversely
So much information to learn in 4 weeks of training I felt like we crammed in as much information to learn the product, that it was not easily grasped and was a little overwhelming. Fortunately, everyone onboard is very knowledgeable and supportive.
No bad comments, best team
Not any at the moment.
Everything - don’t work here They don’t treat you with respect. They lie and don’t hold anyone accountable.
Poor leaders in recent times
Not flexible Not many shift options
Pretty much everything else, the company doesn't care for you if you're in america.
No raises, no bonuses, high stress environment with demands from leadership, no over time
No pay raises. Mundane work. What you get hired for can change real quick.
its just been a cople days seems i been at the company i haven't really see any down said
They to investment from Blackrock. And then the only focus was bottom line.
Frequent layoffs and constant worry about losing the job.
There is no down sides working with Taskus
Uncertain financial prospects and several rounds of layoffs lately. Out of control corporate bureaucracy and increasingly out of touch executive leaders.
No cons that I could see
So far I just will recommend maybe having a 2-week nesting for the next time
not given the tools necessary to be successful no favoritism just a lack of empathy no support or communication
TaskUs is not frontline first like they claim to be. They allow the clients to dictate who should be fired, even when the reason is unfounded, and who can move to a different campaign. A new campaign opened up, that paid $2 more per hour than my current pay. I wanted to switch, but was told I was too valuable to the client. Even though I am so ""valuable"" they couldn't bother to pay me more. Now my campaign will soon sunset, and there's nowhere for me to go. I have spent almost 4 years being an exemplary employee. I exceed expectations and always go beyond what is asked of me. All it's earned me is a $.34 raise. TaskUs in the US does not care about it's employees. They're more concerned with growing their sites outside of the US since it's so much cheaper.
I enjoyed working there. No notice on layoff
I would like to promote task us
- Not many overtime opportunities - Leadership failed to communicate most times regarding changes to position - Workload would fall onto other employees whenever teams would go into meetings
There’s an obvious trend of TaskUs caring more about the Client than it’s own employees which causes most employees to feel neglected or unseen/unheard.
First week did not come across any downsides!
Terrible management, lack of stability, higher ups only care about clients and not their frontline at all. No pay raises unless you are promoted and even at that some are lateral promotions meaning no pay raise.
There were too many lies and misconceptions going on. Couldn't trust them
Management can be too much
Lack of clear communications within the depart that are suppose to work hand in hand to help improve the workflow. Constant changes that are not noted properly which then causes constant confusion. No way to report HR when we are ignored or emails are not answered.
there is no pressureand the atmosphere is very warm
No cleansing period for tardiness.
Lack of structure, everything is urgent, leadership might be disrespectful when under pressure, global standards are too complex and lack of flexibility per region, unrealistic goals.
Opinion but lack of stability in any internal structures, but mostly resources and management focus on offshore not onshore. Believe when you see no growth or North American representation in any advertising, site or employee marketing material. Sadly the smoke and mirrors costs a lot of great talent their jobs, promotions and growth.
not the same company it was before it went public.
Sometimes training can be limited in resources.
HR is just terrible at their jobs. An HR rep blatantly sexually harassed a member of leadership and managed to not only keep her job but continue to be the mouth piece for HR. There were multiple complaints over multiple situations. The worst case of people management I've ever seen.
Moving above teammate means being treated worse.
TaskUs fails to meet their own company culture, care for employee standards, and leaves management with no support for as long as they can until the client complains or notices. Frontline first will only go as far as they can promote it on social media or in stock updates, but when it comes to team or lower management needing support, there is none. Once you reach promotion to TL, your work life balance tanks, and TaskUs does not have sufficient onboarding or training to help new management. It's like they expect people to know how to do a job that no one explains.
The telecenter is too far from the city
there is no pressureand the atmosphere is very warm
Lack of structure, everything is urgent, leadership might be disrespectful when under pressure, global standards are too complex and lack of flexibility per region, unrealistic goals.
N/A so far so good
The companies they work for are hit-and-miss at times.
The schedule from 11 am to 9:15 pm to which I've been changed when I had signed in the contract from 6 am to 4:15 pm, I hope that as I talked with the team leaders, I can be changed back to the other schedule as soon as possible
Opinion but lack of stability in any internal structures, but mostly resources and management focus on offshore not onshore. Believe when you see no growth or North American representation in any advertising, site or employee marketing material. Sadly the smoke and mirrors costs a lot of great talent their jobs, promotions and growth.
not the same company it was before it went public.
HR is just terrible at their jobs. An HR rep blatantly sexually harassed a member of leadership and managed to not only keep her job but continue to be the mouth piece for HR. There were multiple complaints over multiple situations. The worst case of people management I've ever seen.
Moving above teammate means being treated worse.
TaskUs fails to meet their own company culture, care for employee standards, and leaves management with no support for as long as they can until the client complains or notices. Frontline first will only go as far as they can promote it on social media or in stock updates, but when it comes to team or lower management needing support, there is none. Once you reach promotion to TL, your work life balance tanks, and TaskUs does not have sufficient onboarding or training to help new management. It's like they expect people to know how to do a job that no one explains.

The telecenter is too far from the city
TaskUs fails to live up to its promises and falls short in several critical areas. From their lack of ethical consideration and exploitative work environment to their inadequate client support and transparency issues, it is clear that TaskUs prioritizes profit over the well-being of their employees and the satisfaction of their clients.
The production floor are mixed up like us we are from Room 13 and in front of us and at our backs are Gusto employees. We are distracted by their voices especially when they are calling. Cons also is the disputes, like my teammates that are having, they do have overtime works starting on November but up until right now they still did not have the right pay or they still didn't get the money that they worked for.
I don't judge any cons. here only you have to work and getting paid with alot of experience.
Poor management Bad communication no one was ever on the same page High turnover rate No raises or bonuses
Worst upper management EVER, TaskUs hires morons that don't have a clue what it means to support your team. Unbelievable the quality of people they have in top leadership rolls. Zero support in most cases, no ownership in their personal responsibilities! If you want to work extremely hard and long hours without recognition then TaskUs is your place to work. Have a nice day!
Job security and sunsetting campaigns
The expectation to do more with less is not only a core value, but a daily way of professional life. Promises are made for promotions, merit increases, and support, but they are never truly actioned on. They take advantage of good employees and keep the ones that are not.
some accounts are mismanaged, they focus more on micromanagement and not the results
I don't have any negative insight for this company because I really have a RIDICULOUSLY GOOD experience here.
Pay was not great Laid off after 1 1/2 years Operations manager changed 3xs Team leads changed 3xs Outsourced my position
TaskUs has a number of clients that they work with, and sometimes a client's work doesn't align with the company's core values. Regardless, TaskUs does whatever they can to make working hard as fun as possible.
- Terrible line of communication - Constant policy changes (week to week basis) - Highly stressful since they threaten to fire employees over things that are out of their control - They once almost didnt give me tuition reimbursment due to THEIR HR team's lack of knowledge on it - I am trying to get my w2 and theyre literally not answering me at all - They're refusing to give any raises yet can afford to buy hot air balloons to promote the company Overall, if you land any job in this company, DO NOT stay long, outsource to a better job ASAP
Outsourcing to reduce costs despite huge profit margins - claim is people first, but not at a corporate decision-making level. Limited growth potential. Limited focus on innovation. Salary increases don't happen.

Hard to say there is something wrong Maybe homeless problem Maybe some criminal activity
Salary is lower than what most students deserve
This review is only for the School of Public Health, as I'm sure other Schools on campus are a better place to work for. There is toxic leadership at the highest levels of this School and very talented, skilled faculty and staff have left over the last few years because of the way in which the senior leadership ""leads"". They put their own priorities over that of the students and other constituents, trying to stroke their own egos and legacy build. They claim to be an anti-racist organization"", which is a purely performative. They consistently and unethically do what's best for their own interest over the most marginalized, while falsely claiming they're doing this for the School and students. Unless you are okay with senior leaders who are bullies, avoid working here at all costs.
I've experienced no cons here.
As a work study student, it might be difficult to get more hours depending on which job you get
Progression can sometimes be solely dependent on professors' preference.
Lack of good insurance options for student employees Slow salary increase
Only downside was late night shifts
Monotonous work, many students to grade for and not a very active engagement.
Not much room for advancement when you have a certain title
Environment not good, too crowded
none that I can think of
Nothing I can think of
Can be bad if you get a PI who is a bad manager, since you're essentially stuck with them. Most professors at Berkeley seem to be pretty good about this, though.
- Hours got cut short due to team expansion
I never wanted to leave.
Admin process is very slow in general
Not fun in the cold
I experienced no cons at all.
Just the relatively high cost of living in the Bay Area, and bureaucratic processes that can sometimes slow down decision-making and implementation.
must say it takes a lot of time
The work can be slow and sometimes you don't get interesting results.
it's a very very competitive program
Occasionally has out-dated standards for measuring progress
May not be the highest paying. Bureaucracy can make onboarding a long process.

None that I can think of.
High rent in the Berkeley area, no pay for academic intern
Workload is not prpoportional to pay
Not fun in the cold
Low pay, sometimes heavy workload, no bonus or benefits for part time employees
You get minimum wage and continue to get the same amount
I experienced no cons at all.
Very busy so it's hard to find time for professional development, a bit exploitative -- they'll keep piling on work but with very little acknowledgment of that and no pay increase, a lot of people don't know what they're doing and not everything is well-documented, a lot of politics and preferential treatment for certain backgrounds, job security is not great depending on the department, departments range wildly -- I strongly recommend looking into the specific Department you plan on applying at to figure out if it'll be a good fit for you and also, if you can, try to figure out what people in the role you're applying for used to get paid by searching the University of California salary database to get a feel as to how much you should get paid and aim high.

Cost of living in the Bay area.
Graduate students should get paid more.
Can move slow, low mobility
Workload fluctuations, academic environment has a lot of egos, low pay.
Low pay, no advancement unless you keep moving departments. Hard work only gets you more work, while colleagues chill. Students are very privileged and moral integrity is not to be seen.
About 10% of the staff's priority was on social justice work first, their jobs second. Extremely stifling environment to work in if you were around them. You had to be aware of what you could and could not say, and what opinions were acceptable. You could definitely lose your job or end up in trouble with some employees for having the wrong opinion. This was supported by leadership.
Pay increases don't really cover cost of living, so you end up being paid less and less year over year unless you move around within the org.
high cost of living in bay area
Pay No Good when Comparing with industry
Don't expect the salary. It's for learning not making money.
Underpaid, can be difficult to keep boundaries as a resident while off-duty
- Work load can vary considerably for the same position, depending on the course and the professor. Be sure to do your homework. - Can be an immense amount of grading work. Again, do your homework and don't be afraid to let your professor or the union know if it's more than in your contract. - Can pose a serious distraction from your own course load if not managed carefully. - You will likely have to deal with a LOT of emails and issues from students. Set up a separate folder in your inbox and plan to go through them daily to keep them from piling up. Don't be afraid to send some emails up to the professor if you don't think you can answer the question adequately.

","Not much to complain about
I was laid off after 1 and 1/2. Along with many other employees some who had been here 29 years… They gave a terminatiom date 4 month out which at first I thought was them being nice and giving time to find something else. But it became clearer that was for their benefit only so we can help with the knowledge transfer. It also seems as if this was planned for a long time.
PPD was great to work for until they were bought by Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS). Prior to being bought by TFS, PPD always looked out for their employees and took great care of them. Job security was never an issue. If a project closed, PPD was great at always finding a new project for the employees that were impacted. Not so after TFS took over. It's all about the bottom line. Numerous pharmacists have been laid off since TFS bought PPD. There is no job security for pharmacists. Nurses fair better because PPD now seems to have a preference for MIS nurses instead of pharmacists (nurses are way cheaper). Really a sad situation for what was once a great company to work for. Even worse when considering that the original company was ""Ask The Pharmacist"" (ATP), before being bought out by PPD. PPD still treated pharmacists well, but there was definitely a switch to having more MIS nurses than pharmacists. Then along came TFS. Now look and see how the pharmacists are treated. :(
Amount of phone work depends on the project you are assigned
After acquisition by Thermo Fisher, company is more profit minded than people minded.
Salary is way less than current market
1) Promotions, other than CRA level changes, are scarce and competitive. 2) Salary is on the Low end for experienced and seasoned staff, yet some improvements have been reported. 3) The vast majority of staff are female which is nice, yet male counterparts me feel uncomfortable at times, particularly when seeking career advancement and/or promotion. 4) Significant internal changes, including established employee layoffs, by upper management in 2023 have unsettled and alarmed many.
Salary is relatively low compared with other CRO.
Promotions are slow leaving you in the same role for 3-5 years
This company was okay before COVID, it was an easy job, boring but stable. But after COVID the workflow increased due to the quick demand for treatment and vaccines. The company did grow and increase in revenue but the wages did not increase. I worked there for 3 years. I did a lot of overtime, which is common there, and people barely got livable wages. I only stayed because I needed a job during those COVID times. The company still refuses to increase wages even after being absorbed by a larger company and competing research labs pay an additional $7-$10 for entry level. If you do work here, remember you can always leave for more pay and a more secure work life balance at another company. It is also difficult to transfer unless you know someone in a higher position or another department, hard work means nothing here because supervisors do not monitor you.

Senior Execs are the most entitled I've seen in my 30+ years of corporate experience. They are cordial, but the arrogance and way they talk down to you is deplorable. Maybe it's the pharmaceutical market segment, but what 50+ year olds find sense of self-worth by displaying their PHDs on the wall. Pay levels are below market and miniscule annual increases only keep it that way. The TFS acquisition process is sub-par at best. A year and a half post-acquisition and there are still disparate financial tools, HR tools, and the integration is proposed to take at least another year plus. This lack of integration practically creates daily issues with those down stream from the top levels and are time consuming to say the least.
Salary is relatively low compared with other CRO.
Promotions are slow leaving you in the same role for 3-5 years
Comparatively low salary, annual increment is low
Having to deal with two managers. Reprimand if you talk about other employment with the consulting company. Low pay.
PPD was great when it was a privately held company. However, it is clear that Marc Casper does not care about his employees, only about acquiring more companies that he knows nothing about and doesn’t care about running well. There was recently a round of layoffs which was not communicated well, and the day after, an email was sent out announcing that Thermo Fisher had acquired some company for a billion dollars. Such poor and insensitive timing. My team’s morale has suffered greatly due to these layoffs and everyone is in fear that they’ll be next. In terms of the day-to-day, your experience will be highly dependent on your direct people manager, your client(s), and oversight director. If you have a good combination of the three, your work life balance could be ok. Even if all three are good, processes are constantly changing and it’s impossible to keep up with. I spend more time trying to figure out how to do my job than actually doing it. It also takes forever to get anything done because resources can only be requested just-in-time, even if you know you’ll need a resource months in advance. You don’t get a resource if you don’t escalate, which defeats the purpose of escalation. Every ethics submission is late due to not having resources on time, ICF reviews take an extraordinarily long time, CRAs are not assigned in time. As a PM I am running out of excuses for why things are taking so long. It is embarrassing when I could do a submission myself in 5 minutes but am not allowed to due to some obscure internal process that only certain roles are able to do. We are so desperate for new business that every bid is a “must win” but project teams are not set up to succeed after studies are awarded. Budgets are not initially bid sufficiently to support the work - we overpromise and under deliver. Benefits have also worsened since the acquisition. Previously, PTO started at 22 days and we could roll over up to 80 hours, or sell back unused PTO. Now it starts at 15 days for new hires and no more rolling over or sell backs. They also took away MLK day as a holiday - who does that? Thermo Fisher claims to value diversity and inclusion but then takes away the only holiday of the year that celebrates civil rights. There is so much more I could say about how awful PPD has become - stay away at all costs.
Company is cheap and doesn't give good raises. Hard to move up in the company or ask for more money without an offer from another company.
Can’t think of any cons
Very little room for growth in the call center setting. Corporate issues delays promotions.
The larger PPD got, the more Toxic managment became
Not a lot of room for growth
Work can dry up resulting in Layoff
Work-life balance can be challenging as workloads are too high. Salaries for longer tenure employees is too low and not keeping up with new hires. But the largest con has been the acquisition by Thermo Fisher and how it has changed our culture. Not impressed with their leadership and how out of touch they are with the needs of PPD employees. As the acquisition is fully underway, realize how outdated many of their talent processes are. Feels like we've taken a big step backwards
Too many VPs, the org chart is too top heavy to get anything done.
Lot’s of travel, poor onboarding process
None everyone is nice and jibd
after thermo fisher took over, things went downhill fast. taking away PTO days, and PPD employees are paid less than ThermoFisher employees.
Pay is not proportional to the workload
High stress working with scheduled substances
Sometimes hard to get the PTO wanted especially on holidays. Seems impossible to get a promotion to MISII. You have to go above and beyond your job description to even get recognition. Repetitive work.
You WILL be overworked and underpaid. You WILL be lied to by upper management. You WILL be blamed for everything even when it's out of your control. You WILL NOT be trained properly or supported by upper management.
Thermo Fisher Scientific buyout of PPD has led to layoff and loss of PTO/holidays
Now that ThermoFisher has taken over, the culture has gone downhill. It all depends on who your LM is. Everyone talks about flex promotions, but they do not happen unelss you have the right backing. Work life balance is not balanced amongst colleagues. Team work is promoted in theory but everyone is too busy. Some are overworked, others want to work and not given opportunities. I've switched managers 4 times already, and there is just no feeling of loyalty. It seems very dependent on who your team is, how successful you will be and how many opportunities are provided to you.
No consistent pay raises. Favoritism.
Workload is insane. Poor management. Lacks training.
Under paid. Unless you are promoted which is really difficult, or leave to go to another department/company, your rate will stay far behind industry standards and even newer hires. Has gotten too big now. Everyone is a number and focus is on the shareholders.
A lot of work but good work-life balance
Too many managers telling same thing, constant changes, not very good at communicating
-Pressure from higher up (clients) leads to downstream pressures that can't always be handled given the resources the people who work in the lab have -Organization could use work -Moving up levels comes with what seemed to be an imbalance of work (expectations were much higher than the position itself would suggest)
SOP heavy with very little flexibility client-facing Too many systems for everyday work Focus on profitability to the detriment of fostering team culture/engagement (I recognize this may be team-specific) Employees must strongly advocate for themselves to get work-life balance. You must (learn to) be ok with there permanently being more work than you can possibly get done The value of 'intensity' can negatively impact employee work-life balance
Hard to grow within limited resource
Lousy and non-supportive management that backstabs subordinates
low pay. awful management. zero coordination and support.
Too many processes and systems to learn. My manager unfortunately was not very supportive or skilled in her role, which made for a difficult onboarding process.
Workload can be overwhelming at times.
don't give a crap culture. Profit over people.
Tech work can be monotonous and repetitive, not particularly challenging or engaging.
You WILL be overworked and underpaid. You WILL be lied to by upper management. You WILL be blamed for everything even when it's out of your control. You WILL NOT be trained properly or supported by upper management.

When PPD was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific the culture shifted and felt more transactional vs a team feeling.

No complaints at this time.

Work Life balance can be hit or miss
There are brand new associate scientists that make about $4/hr more than people that have 2+ years in that same role. Some of them even make as much as the next position above them. Even the jobs listed online for the same exact positions I'm in are being hired for a higher salary. Apparently, you might as well quit and reapply for your same position if you want a raise, because when you ask a manager for a raise, they'll tell you they don't have the budget for it. Thermo-Fisher's acquisition of PPD also limited the amount of PTO you can accrue and gives us less holiday time off than PPD did pre-acquisition.
Corporate is trimming the fat to line thermo fisher pockets, causes strain on day to day work when there isn’t enough money to improve the situation.
Have to complete internal trainings constantly
So far I have run into very few challenges or ""cons"" to working here. I will say that in general, working from home can be a little more confusing when you're onboarding and settling in. You have to be a little more proactive to make sure you have access to what you need, and all of your information, benefits, computer programs, etc are in correct and working order. There is always help available if you need it but not everything will be spoon fed, you may have to go looking for answers.
Not best for work life balance High pressure, stress, tight timelines
Working with PPD was a good experience initially but I noticed it was difficult to move up or be recognised because of the size of the company.
-middle management feels like just being a mouth piece for upper management so that all the analysts just hate them -promotion opportunities became non-existent -my position just felt like being in a gerbil wheel, week after week
Lower pay than I think
I think it depends on which department you work in since experiences seem to vary quite a bit. Cell lab sometimes has high turnover rate, due in part to lack of work-life balance and people getting burnt out. There was significant turnover (>40%) across the board for analysts up to senior management in a recent year. If you like to make work the center of your life, you'll probably do well and get promoted. But, it is often expected if you are on salary that you will work over 40 hours on a regular basis. Management might not outright say that, but if you actually want to get done everything that you're responsible for, it often ends up being some long days.
Variation of assignments, and can be a lot of travel
High pressure Low pay compared to industry average Raises don’t keep up with inflation Good managers are hit or miss, depends on the team you’re on Promotions above Associate Scientist level (2+ years) are hard to come by.
Turnover sometimes will bolster the workload for other analysts
High travel, long hours, slow expense reimbursement.
Very fast paced and heavy workload
Workload can be pretty heavy
Negative changes to corporate policy since the Thermo Fisher buyout.
There are not many cons.
poor benefits and low salary
Micromanaged, overworked, pay is insultingly low
- You will be hired as an entry-level analyst and given scientist or senior scientist-level work without providing enough training. - Management is very micromanaging and will be expected to stay in the lab for 8 hours or more during your lab time. - Will be expected to do several complex level testing without promotions. - Slow promotions with high expectations for the quality of work.
Compensation is not competitive with the market
There is not a community at PPD, Everyone is worried about a promotion rather than focusing on the overall team progress.
Working in a matrix, being line managed by someone who has never worked in your job position
They expect you to use old custom built software that has little to no documentation and they get mad when you don't know how to do scientific calculations on it when the job you were hired for was to help with oracle and Linux. They underpay criminally and if you're on the tech side it's easy feel very stuck bc they use tech from the 80s and 90s and you never move up in the company either. The project management structure is cruel and makes no sense. I was expected to work 80 hours 2 weeks after my dad died bc a deadline was suddenly moved up on me. We later ended up postponing anyway bc some testing that was the responsibility of another team had not been done until the last minute and the test failed. If you're in tech avoid this place.
low pay slow pace promotion
Very busy and sometime sponsor demands are difficult
Poor upper management. Management was very unwilling to promote.
Difficult promotion , not based on performance
I want to be part of this group for at 2-3 years to gain my momentum & confidence in this field.
No sops No training Trial managers MIa
Pay is not competitive. No matter the length of time working there you will make the same as a new hire with no experience. Management plays favorites. Management and HR will do nothing about harassment.
manager not understanding, no career progression
-Toxic management overall -low pay for industry -toxic/cliqy work environment

","None to say really none
Your happiness is almost solely based on who your VP. AMD is full of amazing people, but a few VPs are nightmares. They will treat you like crap, and you will like it. Because VPs are a rank that are untouchable. No matter how many cases of abuse, threatening, throwing people under the bus for their own decisions, misconduct or anything you take to HR nothing will happen. They will be allowed to burn person after person out. And that's just okay. It's a bit hard to be fair to the whole company, a lot of teams rant and rave about the amazing culture And community they have, but it's incredibly team dependent which is very disappointing
The job can be quite monotonous and boring. I've been in the position about 1.5 yrs and before I accepted the job and from the interviews I got the vibe that the skills I would learn would be more relevant but the job sounded super boring and the interviewers sounded tired. After going through the experience I can say my first 6 months I was pretty excited to be working here, but it's gotten worse each half year. Mainly the projects take a really long time, either to get going or to wrap up. There's always a reason for delaying it getting going, so a ton of time is spent on preparation but we don't ever seem to be confident that everything will go 100% smooth because it inevitably never will. Then the projects that need to be wrapped up either take longer than expected because people don't know what to do well enough, or it hasn't ever been encountered in exactly the way we are now, those are sort of unavoidable but what is avoidable is getting everyone to agree that the solution we came up with is good enough and meets the targets we set so that we can close the ticket, get off the ship and work on the next thing. That really needs improving. Also, the most obvious thing is we have too many meetings. I mean if you google how many meetings people should have in a day, the recommendation is 3-4 but the minimum is 4 and can go up from there, really 5 if you want to be involved in everything, and that's just being present where you need to be. You could certainly spend your entire day just attending meetings and that would not be very productive.
Very corporate mentality while insisting that they are progressive
- You need to have some knowledge or general interest in the hardware.
Siloed teams-depending on the organization
- credit theifs - management lies. They had layoffs less than 2 weeks after the CEO promised on a all hands meeting that there would be no layoffs. - Its easy to get overlooked and hard to be heard - Direction and planning is poor
Thoughout my career, I have worked domestically and internationally - across multiple Fortune 500 companies, and I've never worked for a company as toxic and broken as AMD. They are desperate and hungry to be in the leagues of major tech companies - but at their core, they are extremely dated and broken in bureaucracy. The culture is so toxic, they suck the life out of you by priding themselves on working weekends, skipping holidays and precious family time and celebrations with the hope and prayer for a year end bonus in exchange. This company has the opposite values of any company I'd like to work for long term. There have been so many former employees that have gone to HR about management violating ethics, policies, etc., but the reports are immediately silenced and discarded. The same toxic management continues to prevail, at the expense of so many who wish to escape. Very scary company - stay away!
Not as fast paced as initially thought
Pay should be better and more comparable to other tech companies in Austin

Low TC, If you got a bad manager your faith is locked
Together we advance is not integrating in day to day activities
I was laid off without much warning.
Under the mindset of setting unrealistic targets without a chance to hit does not motivate sellers. Sales reps no longer receive commission checks from this company and nearly 90% of the sales reps are currently looking to make a move. Without a driven sales team AMD is likely is soon face difficult times ahead, regardless if they have the best products in the market. Potential candidates, you will be placed on a 60/40, in order to get anything you'll need to hit 70% of your target. No one hits 70% so you'll want to be prepared for only get paid the 60%>
Slary uncompetitive relative to Intel
Underpaid, by far. Uses the justification that they try to stay around 60-70% of the median pay for a particular position. How can you aim to be the best in the industry when you don't pay anywhere near the best in the industry and you aim for a D average on the pay scale? Shady management practices. Several people I know were told by their management not to discuss their pay with other employees. Managers play favorites and it shows, greatly. Raises are essentially non-existent. We are told that the company pays for performance, but a good performance review will net you a pay raise lower than the rate of inflation. Promised promotions never come, they are always handed to the manager's favorite.
They don't actually have the culture they portray. They don't have enough staff so you rarely feel supported to take time off. New managers are hired that treat teams/people horribly and create a toxic environment.
Sales target is very aggressive target.

Global company means you’re working odd hours sometimes.
Too many people came in recently and impacted the company culture, increasing competition severely. Too much worry about catching up on Nvidia and thus disrupting the company culture and harmony. Managers can easily lay off whoever the want, no matter how talented the engineers are.
Slow to increase salary even those who have been loyal to company for a while
Monotonous nature of work at times.
-Executives do not care about employees -The most outdated HR processes and tools myself and others have experienced in our career -Leadership is not invested in employee’s success -Leadership puts company at extreme risk due to lack of knowledge of labor laws -Toxic work environment -Lack of support and collaboration across groups
Need improve process and product development detail (design and test )
High turnover for FAANG companies makes knowledge-sharing difficult.

The stress and work load is shaving years off my life. It seems like you might be able to tolerate it once you learn everything in your module or area but I doubt I will even make it to that point. There’s a confluence (wiki) page for everything but it’s just like a stack of disorganized papers and makes it useless trying to find needle in the haystack. The status updates and meetings are constant with barely anytime to do the actual work. The number of managers circling around engineers like vultures is excessive. I have about five managers and they all pull you in different directions. Some people should stay engineers or ICs and you don’t need so many managers whose only job is to communicate to upper management. I’m drowning and soon as I collect enough pay I’m jumping off this ship.

-The title and the job description that are posted are often not really the representation of the real job

Long hours, hard to make time for vacation
Sometimes the tech industry can be volatile
The GPU department is understaffed perpetually, which makes for bad work life balance. Promotions are limited
The work environment can be a bit too laid back.
It is too easy to get written up
Each BU is different. The embedded BU is unorganized, a lot of duplicate efforts, unclear career path, unclear expectations, upper management thinks the yearly employee survey results is king but they miss a lot of context. The upper management thinks it is doing a good job because of high revenue, but this is only because they are lucky enough to have great sales people, not great leadership. Interesting embedded products that are just repackaged from the server or client groups, with little embedded-specific value added but marked up in price by significant margin levels.

First off free membership, who wouldn't want that? That was the main reason I applied along with having a simple summer job where I was on my feet. Management was respectful and fellow workers were kind.
The coworkers and members are the best part of the job, very organized company as well
I chose Planet Fitness as my Gym prior to becoming employed because I embrace their Mission Statement. I am passionate about assisting others in finding their own worth and empowering the light inside them. There is no excuse for judging others and/or body shaming - being healthy and fit truly is less about size or body shape. Some of the fittest people I know are not your typical Cover-Model prototypes.

Great Place to Work at
You can workout for free
Free membership, interact with the community.
Firstly, I am a female and was always closing which was at 10 pm, 98% of the time with another female. I felt so unsafe with the crazy people inside of the gym. The manager always left between 4 pm and 6 pm.He scheduled the guys to open! which I felt was stupid. I then became assistant manager and was moved around to about 4 locations within 2 months! Lastly, I left because I felt the last general manager I worked with was racist!
Fun environment Decent customer base
Free gym membership, run of the gym at anytime.
I enjoy the friendly environment, Job flexibility. There are also benefits including IRAs available along with PTO for all employees. At this location, the owner is involved in everyday practices and includes hourly and salaried staff with ideas for creating an enjoyable workplace. The company strives to help all employees move toward the direction of each individual goal in and out of Planet Fitness by providing resources and opportunities.
Good company, good with scheduling and do able tasks.
Straightforward, scheduling, easy to learn
Very easy job I love my co workers Free membership
Extremely respectful and collaborative environment with no micro-managing.
Fun Good people Never the same
It was more like family than coworkers and it was always fun to go to work
Farm team growth Developing relationships with your customers/members Fun environment working in a Judgment Free Zone gym Free gym membership Mostly stress free environment, most people are there to enjoy themselves and exercise
Managers were easy to work with.
staff members people general atmosphere of the place was positive
Coworkers were always great, the pay was decent for a full-time college student working part-time, and the job duties were not exceedingly demanding (selling memberships, check-in guests/answering guest questions, rotating cleaning portions of the gym).
Great work, nice environment, usually calmer by night shifts.
Lots of training opportunities. Great place to develop professional skills, customer service and leadership.
shifts were steady and didn't fluxiate great team there. learned a lot of how to deescalated situations
The best reasons to work at planet fitness is the fact that it is a judgement free zone, with high expectations and the company carrie’s business aspects that are crucial for financial growth practices. The end goal is to increase sales and that will ultimately increase financial gain this is the best business practice to ensure. This is just what I do every day at my planet fitness we drive success and mentorship. We drive happy culture and strive to pursue the best customer service in town.
My coworkers were awesome, the gym itself was not the best and the pay was minimum wage but the job was easy and reliable.
It was a Steady paycheck I guess.
Very flexible and kind staff
- easy -good environment - friendly staff - friendly members for the most part all you have to do is clean, great people, and help with billing problems, the day goes by quick and the schedule is flexible
Fun coworkers and environment wasn't stressful
Super laid back work environment
You get bonuses based off retail sales (if in a franchise that allows) You get raises based off performance reviews SOME opportunity to move up Shifts are good if you work hard (dibs on 7 A.M - 2 P.M, or 3 P.M to 10 P.M)
Pretty easy work, mostly in charge of signing people in and signing people up. Some cleaning required.
Train trainer training trains tren
A few nice guests there.
Great environment with a lot of resources to help build your leadership qualities.
Calm atmosphere and garenteed 40 he work week
Gym environment, friendly people, great atmosphere for people who don't really want to exercise.
Great company culture and great benefits
If you want to work with a bunch of lazy people work here.
Awesome team dynamic Option for full benefits and 401k Free Black Card membership
Free membership for all locations.
Great Members Okay Amenities. Not much else
Keeping the gyms clean and the members satisfied, the 30-day review prevents people from coming in for a quick paycheck and work for that extra $1.25 raise. The actual work is great, low-stress, easy, and satisfying and the majority of the employees are amazing people.
Most of the staff was friendly and easy to work with. That goes a long way because it's really the other associates that teach you how to work efficiently and what's realistic to do with the time that you have.
Good coworkers if you’re lucky, free membership to use if you workout
If you worked there you got a free gym membership which was good to have.
The team over at Planet Fitness in Marietta, OH are really great people. They are very knowledgeable, very helpful, always courteous, and always kind. They are readily available to pick up where someone needs help, and are willing to go above and beyond what is asked of each other in order to make the club a great place for guests and workers alike.
The only pros about this location was that they were flexible with their scheduales.
","The higher ups weren’t very strict
Dealing with human bio in the locker rooms and gym floor without real concern for the physical well being of the staff. We had PPE gear as well as cleaning supplies but for the pay it seemed unfair to the employee to do the right thing in such gross situations. There are also risks working in the space of people being keyed up to workout and establish the rules of the company in a meaningful way without some level of fear for safety for all in involved. You also deal with first aid/interpersonal situations that could be overwhelming for some individuals. If you really want to establish a clean judgement free environment the staff really needs to be trained on handling safety issues overall and communicate as a team as there times where discernment on possible threats to the peace and safety of the building do occur which is also a toll on the mental health. In my franchise in particular there was a positive free resource for mental health and life support you could utilize which I think could be promoted more.
Upper management pretends to care about you. My upper management was rude and condescending. Did not actively listen to issues we had at the club level and then when the issue inevitably came to a head all blame was pushed onto the management team for letting it get to that point. My club had next to no issues, a great team, and members that really cared for our staff. That doesn't mean anything to upper management. During visits from other higher ups, we were told everything was great and the club was doing amazingly well for the location. During our immediate supervisor visits, we were told we weren't doing enough to get memberships and that we were too lenient with our staff. I would never work under that specific franchise again. Some locations are open 24/7 yet only have 1 manager. At all my previous jobs there were at least 3 managers (GM, day manager, night manager). Expect to be answering calls from staff any time of day and on weekends. Also the PTO is a joke. 3.33 hours per paycheck for vacation time. 1 hour per paycheck for personal time. No one should have to work 4 months to get one full personal day.
No cons I have to say bad about the job itself. -just not a lot of career opportunities except for opportunity’s to progress in management. -great job for part time regular employees trying to save up to afford a place on their own or in school, great side or secondary job for non-management employees but probably not good financially as a primary job in terms of a career job unless your full time with a general manager position or any higher positions after that in management. If you want to be able to afford to live on your own and make planet fitness a career job for you, then working your way up in management would be your best option!
Low pay, A new hire can make more than an employee who has been there for +5 years. Raises may go to $1/hour more, but that's probably the max they will give you if you have an outstanding performance. You have to do way more than just greeting members, you may even have to mop half of the gym by yourself on occasions or clean bathrooms.
Horrible management, seriously only a good job for college students or someone who really likes having access to a gym. Micro Managed and very clicky job environment. I was hired to support an employee that was not performing too well working the overnight shift. They fired the person that trained me and who I was supposed to support and then never hired anyone else after that. Essentially after my 1st month on the Job i was doing the work of Two people and then I started to get written up because I was not performing my job well. Literally a joke, I quit after my second write up because of the poor management and 3rd month on the job.
There is a disconnect from the support center to the field sometimes and that can cause tension and confusion but they continue to try to work on this.
Long hours, mean people, cleaning
- Low pay and no incentives or performance bonuses - Strict higher management
Unnecessary tasks for little pay Can be repetitive and boring Strange customers and dangerous situations
The pay. The pay at least at my franchise is not a fair wage for the work that is expected of us. Our turnover rate is absurd and they continue to do nothing about it. Instead they open up car washes? Not a livable wage.
Some of the members are rude and demanding, as with any job in customer service.
standing the whole time 30-minute lunch break
worked for the company in total 3 years one of them being a team lead, the turn over rate at the location was 100% and upper management could not care any less. a majority of staff doesn’t care about cleanliness and doing their jobs. was injured and was on L&I and was harassed by my manager to get the paperwork (i had already gave them to her but she lost the paperwork due to another staff member CLEANING HER OFFICE FOR HER, and they shredded it, that paper had my full social security number, my full address and tons of other info) upper management in corporate sent her to a different state when finding this out instead of firing her they put her up in California with a brand new house and job.
Depends on other franchises, but one specific franchise called Black Duck Partners did a major oopsie and screwed everyone in the franchise. Bring back flexible hours or at least increase the pay to accommodate the workload. Having 4 people on a shift working together on a weekday instead of 2 people a shift because one person has to man the front desk while the other has to clean the whole and burn out quickly. The workload is crazy high for little reward especially when cleaning is very strict with the inspectors. Most locations lost 60-90% of their workers because of the forced schedule change. Some locations primarily have adults or college/high school students. Some high school students can't even work with the poopy hours because most of the time they get out around 3 PM, but the shift starts at 2 PM. Having one overnight is a terrible idea because it's a liability issue and if one overnight gets sick or is unable to make it in? Either way whole situation is just poorly planned out and damages have been done now. So most locations are short-staffed and stressed out because of the workload. Can't blame the managers for the terrible awkward hours that have been forced upon them by the higher-ups. The flexible hours were fine where it was so why break something that's not broken?
Low salary, especially for the amount of hours required.
They fire managers that are liked A regional manager was fired because he was deemed ""annoying"" to other regionals and the president of the franchise The workload is too much for little pay They expect the place spotless 24/7 If you're on your phone for more than five seconds there's a chance you get written up, even if everything is done If staff speak up about a problem they're put onto the bad list and instantly a target to be fired I've worked here for 2 years and have never seen so many people start a job then quit a week later because of how ruthless, aggressive, and disrespectful upper management is If there isn't a female on staff at all points of the day then they will more than likely call someone in to work even if they have the day off
members can be extremely rude some shifts are worse than others (hours wise) may be working alone when it gets very busy
No designated break times/break area Have to take breaks during downtime; no clock out for lunch break & must attend to customers during “downtime” Constantly leaving new hires alone at front desk Horribly understaffed High turnover Low pay
Depending on who’s on the staff, you might work alone
Low pay rate ma barely qualify for any bonuses

There is a lot of cleaning involved.
The hours, you always have to change your shift
- Micromanagement - Tight budget on everything. Manager is allowed to spend $100 on employees only. - Tight retail hours, which look okay on paper but is extremely short saff when someone calls out. - Maintenance & repair take forever - Customer service and Karens
Lot of cleaning required. Frequently asked to work on days off.
Pay is terrible Management wants you to move heaven and earth
horrible pay and horrible hours
Corporate wants you to know you are replaceable. There's no incentive to stay with the company unless you're goal is to get into corporate, of which there is limited opportunities and the road there is not worth it for the pay. As seriously as you may take your job, and how dedicated you are to helping your clients reach their goals, corporate makes it feel like it's a job for kids with how they compensate you and acknowledge your accomplishments. The turn over rate as a whole is high and it honestly feels like they prefer it that way.
Customers can be unpleasant and unkind.
short staffed, other than that good
Not as much overtime available and difficult to accumulate PTO
Low pay rate ma barely qualify for any bonuses
Favoritism Poor management Not enough hours
Members can be rude but that comes with any customer service job.
No pto, and varying shifts due to coworker’s availability.
If you’re a woman, don’t work here. The usual flirty members aren’t the concern, but there is a clear boy’s club within management. Multiple complaints about the women’s room will go unchecked. Concerns about not feeling comfortable with certain male staff members, are ignored (you’re actually gaslighted by management. They will tell you, you’re overreacting or the individual in question is “trying” or is “misunderstood”. Some have even been told that the constant complaints of the strained workplace environment, would not be accepted by corporate (none were ever brought to corporate’s attention). Essentially, looking like everything is fine, to corporate, is worth the safety/comfort of female staff. If we were given HR contacts, HR would be contacted. Since that wasn’t the case, most of the staff that was there prior to the management change, has now left; not because they dislike the job, but because of the unfair/unsafe environment fostered by the managerial boy’s club.
It's a cleaning job. Advertise it as such. Front desk employees get regularly bullied for company policies we have no control over. You never know who will wander into a gym. I have never been harassed at any job more in my life.
I wish the pay was higher
The club is open 24/7 and is open on all holidays with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Eve until 6 am on New Year's Day.
Back office sucks so bad
Our teammates struggle to make their living expenses each month, and it is hard to keep a solid team when they cannot afford to work here anymore. Tasks are continuously added to our list without any 90 day evaluations for pay raises. Us Managers struggle as well with living expenses. The pay does not amount to the stress we are in to meet our KPI expectations as well as cleanliness.
Slow Paced, repetitive, turnover, scheduling
Limited opportunities for growth and I did not feel that the pay was adequate for most positions.
Rude customers Long nights Sometimes impossible goals
A lot of cleaning throughout the day
None. I loved this job.
Corporate would rather spend time critiquing minor problems or cause you to fail then praise you for succeeding
There is nothing really bad about working here.
None such a great job no disclaimer
the hours that they gave you
They don’t pay enough to survive on your own
Bonuses aren’t always a guarantee. Low staff retention rate.
I loved my co workers!
Pay is terrible Management wants you to move heaven and earth
Low wage. You will perform housekeeping duties- yes, cleaning machines and bathrooms.

very unprofessional management People make their own schedules Get stuck working alone all the time

Rude customers Long nights Sometimes impossible goals
The GM never had my back when customers would act out but did something about it if it was someone else.
A lot of cleaning throughout the day
None. I loved this job.
pay was too low people stole cars
Sometimes the position felt sales-oriented, angry guests trying to cancel their membership, short breaks, and the requirement to recite a script over the phone no matter what the caller was calling about.
Nothing so far, but some locations aren't as good as others.
Not much room for growth within the company
a lot of detail cleaning
There are no cons. I love my job.
Dirty, understaffed at times, difficult gym members.
Job is 80% cleaning and Manual labor instead of just sales They test you on your knowledge with anonymous phone calls The gym is so affordable that you deal with the worst sort of people
There are no cons in my opinion.
- it is customer service so you have to deal with people who don't remember what they signed up for and for those that try to get political too
low pay disconnect between management and employees
Upper management had SUPER unrealistic expectations when they would come in to supervise
Lots of gossip and drama, it is a very social environment Can be enticed into working overnight without additional compensation Management only needs Planet Fitness experience and no prior management experience.
Low pay but that’s expected
Pay pay pay pay pay
HORRIBLE management, low pay, no room for growth.
You don’t receive enough pay for the amount of work you compared to other gyms in our industry.
Lack of growth in position.
Too many rules, not for people who like to workout
Long work hours during quarter and year ends
-they dont recycle the thousands of bottles that are used every day in each gym -ad was for full time and only gave me part time -the recruiters and training are less qualified than the part time janitors who did absolutely nothing -equipment is cheap, frequently breaks, and takes weeks to get fixed -the janitors did nothing and I had to clean everything or nobody would This place needs a coup..
Lots of member complaints Low employee pay - leading to lots of turnover/call outs/no shows/late arrivals & openings 24 hour facility - drug overdoses overnight and safety concerns
Many responsibilities for little pay.
Not a good work environment Dirty
Planet Fitness does not care about its employees or lower management whatsoever. They cut hours and have gotten rid of full-time employment in order to not pay benefits or lunch breaks. They implement policies that do nothing for the customers but hurt their employees. They look for cheap fixes to problems rather than attacking at the source (i.e., equipment is always broken but instead of replacing they keep buying parts that never keep it functioning for more than a few uses). Upper management, like regionals, micromanages and ignores the actual employees in the stores when asked questions and they expect one person to work an entire 8-hour shift and keep the gym clean by themselves. Additionally, there is no maternity leave even for full-time employees, instead, they have them use their only two weeks of paid vacation and then expect them back at work, leaving their two-week-old infant at home.
Management might get pressure from corporate and a bad manager will unload that pressure unfairly onto you in a way you can't realistically achieve- not with the resources you have been given.
A lot of cleaning, not much room for growth, little raises, low pay
Makes employees clean a lot. Job description says ""Front Desk Agent"", but they really expect you to also be a custodian also.
I wouldn't recommend the job as a main career, as the pay isn't the best.
Management has the worst communication skills, they will leave you in the dark about everything. They dont train their employees the best, they micro manage you and treat you like a little kid! They never reward you for going above and beyond for the work you put in. Managers are disgusting with how unprofessional they are.

","Nothing , this is the best job I had
Nothing to add at the moment
Not climate controlled, it's 95°-115° most months of the year, and can get quite cold in other months. Very dusty and dirty place. Hard to move up the ladder unless you know someone, or kiss backsides. It is physically demanding and hard on the body. It's not a difficult task, just demanding and potentially dangerous with various chemicals if you're not careful.
Cost pressures cause good projects to get delayed or cancelled due to funding. A lot of new operators make running they equipment more difficult.
I don’t like that the hours are not fixed.
Polymers is a dead end for R&D discrimination - sexist, and will be treated differently unless you are white or black. Zero care given to those with disabilities and retaliation is taken if you try to speak up gaslighting - management will say one thing and another the next day, lie to you and HR will back them up. They treat you like dirt then right when you're about to quit they give crumbs and false promises to get you to stay bullying - management gangs up on technicians and ""make examples"" of those who try to ""speak up"". I saw someone get physically assaulted and there were no consequences. Those with disabilities are spoken down to and kept from becoming full time hires
Poor pay for non-salary employees, had to work through temp agency
A lot of opportunities but really need to know the people to move ahead
None that I can think of
Dirty Hot Flare up allergies
Low pay No benefits if you are on contract work pressure
Limited diversity in upper management
no major drawbacks for basf
Not much room for advancement. Pay is very slow to progress, low percent cost of living raise, and top pay is unrealistic. Depending on what unit you’re in dictates your work life balance. Some have very little overtime, whereas others are very demanding with constant forced overtime and months of blocked vacation dates. Every year something new to save money is taken away from us. Instrument techs are very unappreciated for the amount of extra work that is given to us and mostly goes unnoticed.
competitive pay with operators around site.
You are just a number
Political management. BASF = Better Ask Someone First.
No cons that comes to mind
Highly bureaucratic and sometimes hard to get things done. German-centric organization with directives within the regions coming from the central Ludwigshafen headquarters. You can grow within the org but they have their own, internal, executive grooming program so you are limited in growth unless you are part of that club.
Reorganization on a regular basis
Usually they do lots of M&A or separate the company which gives employees some uncertainty but a really beautiful company
Wide disconnect between trench level employees and upper management. Company does not always deliver on promised compensation.
Political management. BASF = Better Ask Someone First.
I can’t really think of anything. I have seen good and caring people there. Yes, like all other companies they have layoffs which obviously is painful.
The biggest issue at McIntosh is the majority of the employees are going to retire 10 years or less. Those employees have gone through so many rounds of layoffs and plant shutdowns that they are just wanting to make it to retirement. So, those people do their jobs with bare minimum effort and the newbies have to pick up the slack. I guess it is earned. Do not expect to have a computer or email your first week on the job. Unless…your manager was proactive about it. The company is too over layered with management and dotted lines. The buck is constantly passed from one person to the next. It seems like very few people actually “do” anything at all except the operators, chemists, admins and clerks. It’s rediculous at times. There’s so much red tape to get anything done. For example, it takes 20+ emails to get material samples into the plant before anyone knows what’s going on. Business has slowed so much that a unit is having to shut down for a few months and management is telling us not to worry. Ok… It’s tough to get people onboard to make lasting changes or get anything done even with constant barrage of meetings and updates. I’m not sure what the other divisions are like. I get the impression that they may be better. BASF literally built its main verbund site in Germany to operate on Russian natural gas. Now that’s shut off. The company is continuing to invest in China…who is becoming more antagonistic towards the West.
Poor work-life balance. Long hours plus potential to work everyday
There are not many cons, maybe a little transparency would be good.
Every reorg changes the strategy.
Poor culture and that’s about it
Headquarters in Germany culture is different there
There are not many cons, maybe a little transparency would be good.
toxic manager and no products in the pipeline.
No way to advance through work ethic or performance. Have to be in the pocket of management and have grown up with everyone. If not from around here you will always only be a shiftworker. They will not give you any opportunity to better yourself and climb higher if not a local boy or girl. Union is non existent. Top USW reps only show up to make sure people keep signing up and at contract time and then still give away benefits.
Every reorg changes the strategy.
Some of the managers create a toxic workplace and upper management ignores the situation. There are no development or growth opportunities and technicians are treated like lesser people.
Big corporate structure. Very little communication
Headquarters in Germany culture is different there
Administrative red tape, outsourcing jobs from US, relationship between functional roles and businesses is poor, executive leadership, internal politics at senior levels.
Sometimes size is a problem with communication and standardization.
Pay is on the lower side compared to other chemical companies or similar jobs.
No real drawbacks that I can think of
toxic manager and no products in the pipeline.
Timeline getting things done or making changes can be significant.
No way to advance through work ethic or performance. Have to be in the pocket of management and have grown up with everyone. If not from around here you will always only be a shiftworker. They will not give you any opportunity to better yourself and climb higher if not a local boy or girl. Union is non existent. Top USW reps only show up to make sure people keep signing up and at contract time and then still give away benefits.
Nothing bad to say about it
Some of the managers create a toxic workplace and upper management ignores the situation. There are no development or growth opportunities and technicians are treated like lesser people.
Disconnected senior leadership, poor pay advancement beyond initial salary.
Work was often monotonous, but that was just the nature of the work
I didn't like the location. It was remote and the only big town is Corpus which is like 50 miles.
Not many to choose from, very careful and involved field of work
Big corporate structure. Very little communication
Some of your experiences will vary wildly based on manager and if you are in a field/office location.
I don’t have negative feelings about this company.
Equal grow opportunities only up to certain level.
Location is in the middle of nowhere
The parent company is tied to the German economy, which is under pressure
Changes are slow. Promotions can be slower depending on the group you’re in or if you’re not open to relocating
The matrix organization sometimes makes decision making slow
Felt upward progression was harder to achieve for a greater part of the population
Extremely demanding as well. Objectives are written such that thaey are rarely completed 100%
Matrix management can lead to confused lines of authority.
long working hours no competitive salaries
Managment lacks vision and a coherent plan for the future.
Management is bad. Union should be stronger.
There are no cons to working for BASF.
Lots of red tape and hard to get things done.
A long daily drive with heavy traffic
Stuck development takes awhile boring sometimes
Working in direct sun light and having the possibility of a heat stroke.
high German focused and very little for minorities
Management sucks, especially when they think they know what they’re doing but don’t. It’s a small plant so you can’t even go above someone to get something fixed.
Does not have competitive pay
Matrix management can lead to confused lines of authority.
They will work you into the ground with overtime. Stay away from BASF, McIntosh, AL. This plant is ran by idiots, especially management of Area 1 Synthesis units. Except production manager Gary Lafon, he still have a brain.
long working hours no competitive salaries
Managment lacks vision and a coherent plan for the future.
There are no cons to working for BASF.
A long daily drive with heavy traffic
Stuck development takes awhile boring sometimes
Bad politics Poor management and jealousy between peers, toxic work environment Labs are dilapidated Overall I would not recommend anyone to work here
Working in direct sun light and having the possibility of a heat stroke.
Difficult to move to higher positions
No trainings, only some in-house trainings Technology positions must turn in timesheets monthly Sometimes you are asked to work on things that are not from your field You just get a job...no a career
Pay was fair, but other companies paid more.
Promotions seems rigid Communication lacks some
Racist people that are haters and dumb
Program can sometimes be disorganized Requires some effort to steer the program to what your career interests are
sold business to smaller company
Leadership Turnover every other year
Very hot in summer. But company provide water & downdraft air conditioner for workers. Very cold in winter. But company provide coats. 12 hour shifts for production workers
Big layoffs during pandemic, laid off 20% of the company
Hard work in chemical plant
Pay is a bit low
Company loses its ability to innovate with so many restrictions from “supporting” groups such as procurement/IT/Saftey. Getting anything done becomes a headache and a burden. Getting a PO for a vendor who is the best for the end result is an enormous task when you have to get them through a system called Avetta, then you have to fight procurement on thier recommendations who have no clue the end result of the preferred vendors output. They only understand the input to the vendor - aka how much money. Don’t forget you get what you pay for. Imagine the money that could be saved yearly by not having these “support” groups. Any money saved by getting a cheap vendor is offset anyways by the departments yearly overhead, but the added work and frustration caused by having the non technical group try to steer the technical folks on whom they deem as the best supplier could be a great step in allowing for more freedom to do one’s job.
Poor employee morale. Dirty/out-dated environment and equipment. Gap in communication from operators to site leadership.
The office politics and bureaucratic going-ons
I rotate and that is a little difficult.
Not the best experience with recording data/information and translating that to new employees.
Last couple of years, people started to express their political views openly and became aggressive over minority people. Leadership is inexperienced and enjoy pleasure travel and call them business. HR doesnt care about racism or complain. All those trainings are jokes.
Excellent company to work for!

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sysco-Reviews-E634.htm,"Great company with work life balance
The pay and customer relationships
Lots of flexibility in my schedule, some great co workers, great boss, not too corporate - even people at VPO and President levels are down to earth. The Safety Department has officially been turned over to corporate which was probably the best move imaginable for the safety and health of Sysco as a whole. The Sysco corporate safety team is really trying to make a difference and they genuinely do care. Sysco corporate EHS team gets a gold star and a A+ for effort in my book. They are really doing what they can to make an impact.

","Sales can be difficult to grow
Long hours, hard work and some customers hard to work with.
At the site level - Lacking professionalism, lacking leadership development and lacking operations buy in for safety initiatives across the entire company. Being in any support role at Sysco (Safety, Maintenance, Inventory, IT) you’re seen as a production blocker or a clean up crew. Sysco is an Operations and Production first company for sure. Safety and Quality do come second and third and this is very much due to lack of true leadership skills within the organization. Things are changing slowly but surely. I do believe it will always be an ops and production first company though. So if you can live with that and if you’re in a support role at the facility, just be prepared to pick and choose your battles wisely. You are either not doing enough or doing too much and getting in Ops way.
IT jobs are being moved to Sri Lanka
Cant think of any, seriously.
all about the numbers, need to hit targets not matter what
Boring, as leadership doesn't know what they're doing, so simple tasks take months.
None Bone Hard Early Driving
You are nothing but a number and your customers are nothing but a number. They care about little besides their bottom line, and their corporate requirements make it much harder to do your job.
Healthcare PPO plan could be better IMO. Limit of only 2 weeks vacation regardless of tenure or or title needs to be revisited. Only offering continuing education by providing CBT is weak.
Out of touch with the industry, their customers, and their sales force. The only people they care about catering to anymore is the stockholders. They micro manage sales people to death with constant CRM management, planned daily sales calls, with management just ""randomly"" dropping in to your planned calls to check on you. They believe cut costs anyway they can, and when you think they can't get any cheaper.... they do it again. They complain about losing market share, and then hamstring their sales people by taking away the ability to use samples, stop allowing specialists to work in the field (due to not wanting to pay their vehicle expenses), and even dont let district managers work in their districts for the same reason. They try to convince customers that Sysco has the best customer service when they have the worst of all of the foodservice suppliers by far. They literally will do the absolute least a customer will allow them to get away with, and then even if a customer leaves over it, they still won't do any more to win them back.
Boring, as leadership doesn't know what they're doing, so simple tasks take months.

Pay doesn’t add up to the new sysco Benefits used to be really good now they are horrible You are asked to do way more than your job description without the pay matching Employees aren’t benefiting only the higher ups They sent us home permanently without any extra compensation & refuses to give any extra money for internet, desk chairs.

Managing your career solo without HR guidence
I Didn’t like management there
Management horrible, two face and don’t care about you, they care about there numbers
Pro not enough. Compensation is lower than market.
Nothing that was not obtainable.
Executive leadership communication and lack of support
Very Busy environment always unexpected
hard work and must be detail oriented
Corp. ran, management conflicts with Corp.
There are more opportunities than there is time
The down side, opportunity to grow. It’s all about who you know
Lots of meetings, trainings and classes. Feels like your on the computer too much.
Long hours. No work life balance in the beginning.
Everything about the job is awful
traveling a lot no company car
Pay was bad back in 1992, five bucks an hour.
Sometimes there isn't enough time to be trained or to train new employees.
Management was absent; old-school attacks and brow-beating at “team meetings”; sexist “you’re pretty, let the men speak” attitudes OFTEN.
Didn’t have good equipment to work with
Poor leadership. All new leaders that don't know what's going on or how to execute effectively.
Better equipment better communication not to many stops
No work/life balance its just work balance ( expect 12 hr shifts 5 days a week) Very physicaly demanding, some days you will feel like you got hit by a train (even when your used to it) Everything rolls downhill and the driver is at the bottom of the hill. The following isnt an everyday occurrence but it is often: Bad routing affects the driver Poor warehouse performance affects the driver Poor management decisions affect the driver And it seems like nobody is held accountable for their poor performance. So essentially the driver is supposed to put up with it.
They fired me while I was on workman's comp after being injured on the job
They have poor management at night
Chaotic dispatch and poor communication
Unorganized, band aid fixes on equipment, wear and tear on body because the warehouse loads the trucks crazy, will be digging through boxes all day,
Work life balance is none of you want to make good money
Better solution and team work could be helpful
Not enough pay for amount of work
Warehouse loads the trailers very inefficiently, a lot of your day is spent sorting out boxes to make your delivery
hard work and must be detail oriented
Corp. ran, management conflicts with Corp.
There are more opportunities than there is time
Hard work to earn your money
The down side, opportunity to grow. It’s all about who you know
Transportation and Warehouse Dept are revolving doors, brought into the union after 90 days so they terminate the majority of the new hires before that. They are ALWAYS UNDERSTAFFED and lean heavily on recruitment and not fixing the internal issues and root causes. Leadership: Very ""old boys club"" mentality from management. Promoted based on popularity, especially in the warehouse. This issue starts from the top. I worked at Sysco for just over a year and I saw multiple VPOs, HR Directors, Transportation Directors, Warehouse Supervisors, Transportation Supervisors, over 100 CDL A Drivers, and 75 Warehouse Order Selectors all come and go. The management would rather hire quantity over quality and always pass the blame to others. Almost zero accountability.
Long hours. No work life balance in the beginning.
12 hour days. 60 hour work weeks. routes often longer than legal limit: 14-16 hours 10-15 stops per day. regularly digging product out side door of freezer. 28 foot trailers regularly packed out overflowing. you are always on your own. expectation is to finish route every day 550-700 cases per day.12k-15k lbs by hand.
They want you forever it is annoying
Pay was bad back in 1992, five bucks an hour.
Sometimes there isn't enough time to be trained or to train new employees.
Everything… prepare to be a slave to long hours, physical labor, and micromanaging. There is a reason while in the 1 year I was there they went through 65+ recruits they either quit or didn’t make probation. Almost all of Sysco drivers are divorced or unhappy marriage because of the long hours. There is a joke that you spend more time with your two-wheeler than your family and it’s funny but not in a concert type way more like a sad reality way. Stay away!
Better equipment better communication not to many stops
- management wants to pretend that customers issues are trivial and only want to help large customers and ignore smaller ones - so many issues in the warehouse and with drivers instead of treating people decent and offering better pay they force them to work longer and harder and at the end of the day the customers and staff are the ones that suffer. - sales job without commissions, people quit and get fired and the other sales reps are required to take on more business with no additional pay - promotions and spiffs are non existent - DSMs micromanage and create their own policies to get ahead and are very quick to Throw their team under the bus.
Sysco requires a difficult work life balance
They have poor management at night
Sometimes work life balance issue , Can be stressful, Too many phone calls sometimes, weird grading system for calls , too specific PTO requests
Better solution and team work could be helpful
Sketchy ""Leadership""... generally shortsighted. Bureaucratic methods. Typical Good Ol Boy Club. Hard to move up & get promoted Overpaid Execs. Underpaid minions.
Our prices makes us difficult to compete in the industry
Long hours, Trucks are subpar for new drivers
Medical premiums are too high
insurance is through Aetna which is not accepted everywhere
Hiring Freeze, Inability to move internally
System is not set up to enable anyone to recieve commission without sticking around to outlast others, no mileage reimbursement
If you exist outside of work or you have a family you care to see, this job isn't for you. That 100% in the Pros section is NOT an exaggeration. If you take breaks, you are not going 100%. Legally they have to offer breaks and so they do. But taking breaks means you're sacrificing your pay. The biggest issue besides these is how prone each worker is to injury due to everyone flying around at top speeds on heavy equipment with full payloads to meet their quotas. The goal is absolute perfection at the fastest possible speed and that's fine, but it guarantees that the position will be further supplemented by machines until the workers are replaced entirely. If you're looking for a career, go elsewhere or prepare to be laid off in a decade when corporate realizes how much they could save by investing in a warehouse layout fit for order selection machines. Yeah the union may help you, but it won't stop the company from upgrading for the sake of efficiency and letting the dominos tumble.
Unknown, I had a great experience
Micromanaged some days Get talked to when your numbers are down but never praised when your numbers are up Too much extra computer work for no reason
Outsourcing has got my job in question.
I think the pay could have been better.
High demand in every position
Do not get much time off for holidays
Pay is low for downtown markets Car allowance is not enough, can not write off mileage Salesforce boxes to check. Micromanagement 7 day a week job
In South Florida Location management is big team yet very unorganized. Your clock starts when you walk in and it can be over an hour by the time you get your route and equipment then somehow deliver to 14-18 stops with no instruction on where to park or what to do for that location. Example i once had to park on a sidewalk blocks from a beach location carry the pallet with product and my dolly to back of restaurant then on a little dolly carry product up the stairs over a thousand pounds of it and that was just one stop. You are not set up to succeed in the job just get whatever you can done at any cause. Many more examples like it. Not something you can feel good about. I worked for a subsidiary company in the NW states with a skeleton crew with much more success in similar role.
home time could be better. says home daily but days end up being longer than usual
Get paid biweekly No assigned trucks You will work!!!
Long hours bad management schedule
Physical work will burn you out

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-Cheesecake-Factory-Reviews-E2229.htm,"They are so amazing and the had a great time working here!
Great pay and flexible hours
Cheesecake is a very diverse company, with people from all walks of life. They have wonderful ideas and concepts for their restaurant. From taking care of their staff to grooming fantastic managers.
Clean, extremely organized, coworkers not too bad
- MOST of the managers are accommodating and will work with you for whatever you need - Can be fun if you enjoy customer service and problem solving - Relatively easy (speaking as a hostess)
You can make a lot of money working here. However, this is subject to change based on how successfully/unsuccessfully management is with hiring. Many cases of hiring unqualified people who rarely make it past training (and staff members are required to train and are given no choice). Overstaffing has been an issue as of late and will likely continue (2023). The work environment can be fun, and flexibility is a plus. Just make sure you set your availability WHEN YOU GET HIRED. Trying to change it once you have been working there is met with push-back.
Great coworkers Flexible schedule Not much more
Good food. Good training. Always steady.
I made a lot of money and you can always get hours
You can change positions pretty often with no hassle or interview require. Once you are in you are in. 50 % off food and some managers will give you a free meal if you do a good job.

Discount on the food for employees.
Money...wait, let me correct that: STUPID MONEY. In other restaurants, customers usually buy an entree each, and maybe an appetizer or bar drink, with the possibility of them grabbing something for dessert. Not at the Cheesecake Factory. Almost everyone orders dessert of some type, and most of the time they just get it to go (order it in a to-go container, take a few bites, then just close the lid). Each cheesecake slice is ~$10. That's 50% of what an entree averages, and it's almost assured that everyone gets dessert while they're there....and the best part is, even if they order it to go, they usually tip 20% as if they were eating it in-house. The money is amazing....IF you are hungry and grab it. There's always shifts to pick up, too. Just know, serving is the best way to make money there. As an example: today was Monday, and I worked 4:30-10pm. I made $200. I could have left at 8pm, but probably wouldn't have made more than $150 if I had left earlier. The money's there, you just have to be hungry and grab it.

Cared about their employees and health
Working for this company has taught me many life skills. Along with patience, hospitality, and it was always a reliable dependable job.
Big company but small feel allows for employees to see many areas of the company and your specialized area. This allows for employees to grow and have opportunities you wouldn't get in a larger corporate office where you may be pigeon-holed into a specific role.
I love the greats foods created and the positive vibes co workers bring. The best thing of all is the relationship I share with some of my coworkers through the cheesecake experience.
Gave me time off when I got sick and diagnosed with my sickness. Willing to work with me when I didn't understand something and had a great work environment.
Take home cash at the end of each shift. Steady throughout the year.
Some great staff and decent cocktails
This is the only place I’ve worked at in the past couple of years that I actually enjoyed. I had to quit due to a pulled hamstring.

Employee morale is high and you can feel it through the organization. From the employee benefits to the celebrations big and small, we are encouraged to work hard and celebrate big! There are a lot of moving parts that keep the job interesting and challenging. The company works hard to appreciate their employees and it shows. Truly a unique and impactful place to work.
","No cons for me - had a good experience
Learn on your own time.
They have such a large menu that it takes an enormous staff. And maintaining such a large staff with the demand here in Utah is difficult. The demand on the staff is so strenuous that when new staff is training. most of the time the staff is forced into working extremely hard shifts before their training is halfway done. And the recipe requirements make it difficult to train staff well for the volume of either restaurants in SLC in such a short period of time. Making the turn over in these restaurants high. And one restaurant don't really even have any veteran staff, mostly because they keep promoting them (which can is good that they're willing to promote). Though once in management it is hard to be promoted because the mentor program they have doesn't exist here. Making it very hard to move up. They say that there is a good work and home balance, but they always need you to stay late....I was working 14+ hour shifts 3-4 of my 5 shifts a week.
Not much opportunity to make money unless you sell your soul and commit to a life long career. Was promised full time hours which were diminished by the week until I was down to one day and told to pick up. Shifts only lasted 3-5 hours. Sections were small. Management played by the book like it was the bible. Rules were very strict. 1 food running shift a week which you barely got any money because they have 2 other food runners on. Tip out was way too high. Was tipping out bar on food sales and food runners on bar sales.
- No tips for hostesses. If you want to move to a serving position without experience, be prepared to wait a long time to move up. - SO understaffed - Guests and even your co workers can be entitled and rude for no reason lol. If you don’t like customer service pls pick another job
Management gets pressured to overstaff servers due to the low hourly rate. In general, the more servers working a shift, the less money you will make. This becomes a problem considering tenured staff (5+ years) is treated very similarly to newer hires (under a year). On the contrary, they are incentivized to save on labor costs for all hourly employees (cooks, dishwashers, hosts, etc.). One can imagine how this can lead to chaotic, frustrating, and inconsistent up and down swings from day to day, week to week, or month to month.
I don't even know where to start. You are a number here, a body to fill a slot. You are not appreciated or valued and if you can accept that you are replaceable at any minute, the company and all your managers don't care about you at all. Lying from ALL managers, no communication, made up rules, run like a prison, breaking the law DAILY, crappy food, they've been cutting corners for years, absolutely garbage clientele getting 5% or stiffed is a multiple nighly occurrence. I feel like I work at an Applebee's in Chicago. Turnover is HUGE. The employees that have been there the longest get treated poorly and don't get shifts because out GM likes new people he can control. Honestly l cannot express how miserable everyone is here. Cheesecake Factory used to be a great company to work for now they are a joke and have zero respect for their long term employees. RUN FROM THIS PLACE!
Managers vary. Money is iffy. Lots to learn.
I worked a ton, traffic, you can't be late without getting written up. They're petty about some things
Poorly treated by customers and managers. No care for employees, really low salary and benefits. Managers will play favorites and some of them like to smoke weed so if there is an employee that can provided free at low cost then their performance don’t matter. Managers will also have sexual relations with servers given hot woman an advantage. I met the CEO and did not even bother to speak to the staff. For the pay you are expected to know everything and do multi jobs at once while getting abuse by customers.

Highschool environment which I wasn’t a fan of
Tip outs to other employees are high
Some of the hours can be long. Side work takes a long time.
The lack of communication between departments (primarily Development Dept) by not sharing critical information/dates in a timely manner causes everyone's jobs to be much more difficult than necessary. It also makes planning very challenging and valuable time expended on projects only to have to redo work that's already been done. I have heard several co workers (in other depts) express their frustration with the lack of communication between depts. We work for a large company with people who care but can often feel like the right hand doesn't always know what the left hand is doing. I understand that I'm expected to work beyond my normal hours when necessary to get the job done but believe there is much wasted time & energy that could be avoided by better communication. I take no issue with working hard, as long as it's smartest way. The work more often than not spills into my personal time.
Very by the book but not many cons
Salary is not empathetic for the activities
Don't recommend for people who can't handle chaos
Managers vary. Money is iffy. Lots to learn.
If it’s slow…they send you home.
Tip outs to other employees are high
Management will push their staff to their limit to get through the busy rushes, denying lunch breaks and even bathroom breaks. Lots of theft in the employee locker room.

“Cheesecake way” of serving can sometimes include unnecessary things
Very by the book but not many cons
Lack of hours. No meal break
Inconsistent messages, actually run by the young hires, lots of backstabbing, holding grudges, child-like environment
Salary is not empathetic for the activities
Don't recommend for people who can't handle chaos
Unrealistic demands on work load, intense cleaning, heavy lifting and restocking. I felt like I was working for a cleaning company or in the warehouse again with all the EXTRA DUTIES they require you to do before they let you go home. They come inspect your cleaning with a cloth and run their finger along surfaces to check for dust. It is highly exaggerated and they make you feel like a child and it is very insulting. I don’t use the bathroom until I get home because they make you sign this waiver when you get hired pretty much waiving your rights to a break. You supposedly get a break only if you work a double shift. That’s the trouble with working for food and beverage places that don’t have a Union to protect your rights. They see that you have been working your tail off all day and they just check in every so often ( the managers) to ask if you are having fun and they are serious! You only see your schedule for one week at a time and makes it very difficult to plan anything in advance not knowing until the last minute if you’re going to have to work.
Typical petty drama and turn over but that's just the restaurant life.
I don't know any right now I just no it would be a experience to work close on hands to learn more about the cheese cake factory 🏭
I have nothing bad to say about this place, my work experience at the winter park fl Cheesecake Factory was outstanding
Orientation Day- They will give everyone else a bag with their work gear forgetting yours. (Your the only one who doesn't get a bag) (Makes you feel excluded) They say they will make you a bag buy you will sit there waiting for days after the orientation waiting for a call to schedule you with your trainer. I had to call this company a whopping total of over 8 times to find out if and when I'm going to start (I declined multiple positions for this one and can't work) (You will need to stay on top of them by just showing to the restaurant because NO ONE calls you back like they say. You show up they Starr trying to schedule you. After a month of waiting for shoes that should have been able to be ordered at orientation but couldn't through the crews for shoes Program and after shelling out 27 dollars for their Food Serve Card you will still see them giving you every excuse why you don't have your schedule. Told them about the limitations of my schedule only being one hour block from 2pm to 3pm on weekdays. I told them this info at interviews (multiple), in conversations regarding my schedule (they promote Flexibility which is why I joined)...Flexibility is a joke with this company and even when you tell them you can't work that time block but you can work their 4pm to 1030 shift and any shift on weekends and they will still schedule you then say tough luck after lying to you multiple times to your face saying they will work with you and be FLEXIBLE. No they won't you ONLY to be flexible to them saying their training people over you and don't know when they will be able to schedule you after you stand your ground on your schedule. I ended up taking back my food Serve Certification after a month of the carnage due to me accepting one of two job offers as a Cruise Line Cook. Hawaii here we come...Thanks CCF...it's been real...NOT...Stay away...they will talk about you like your the problem and never look at themselves.
-gets to be very clicky, one of the worst cases of adult workplace drama or in other words, adult playground for highschool drama. -bartenders now get to choose their sections and beware if a new GM comes to your location, they'll schedule you less hours if you were there prior to them arriving and give you smaller sections. -Guarantee you won't get any overtime because they mass hire servers/hosts/bakers/bartenders -Don't expect getting promoted especially if you bartend or become a Star bartender (Which essentially consists of more responsibility; opening, closing, putting in liquor orders, etc .. making minimum wage pay!) -favoritism
Super busy. Constant lines n busy tables
Can get very busy and stressful
Management is not as invested in the guest experience as they should be, which often interferes with how much money you can make in a shift.
Management will push their staff to their limit to get through the busy rushes, denying lunch breaks and even bathroom breaks. Lots of theft in the employee locker room.
Not really any cons for me personally
Rude customers, busy schedules and constant demands
late night hours can be brutal
Work/ Life Balance is not the best as you are expected to work 10-12 hour opens or close shift
Difficult schedule, a ton of extra responsibilities, a challenge to be promoted, a lot of micromanaging
It's difficult to get evenings and/or weekends off.
“Cheesecake way” of serving can sometimes include unnecessary things
HAZING: bussers, bartenders, some managers, and food runners will haze new servers, unless you are a straight man you need to tip a lot extra in order to gain respect from bussers and bartenders they only started being nice to me after working for a year
Not very flexible schedule. However this is more of a personal conflict.
It can be frustrating and physically exhausting. I average walking about 5 miles per shift. Also, your weekends go from ""relax time"" to ""best way to make money"". Additionally, the restaurant as a whole (specifically the servers) can be drama queens. It isn't the fault of the restaurant or the management...with a staff that large, it's bound to happen.
Unorganized and not ran too well
Expectations not clear and riddle like communication from upper management Lack of flexibility for work model
The restaurant gets insanely busy, and customers can be difficult.
Management sucks and don’t listen to your needs Horrible scheduling
Not really any cons for me personally
-you are worked to death as a dishwasher -for the majority of the time your work will go unappreciated -there is no reward for working hard or doing well at your job except the occasional approving remark -becoming a certified trainer does not give you a raise -you will be made to train new workers even if you are not certified -there is little to no reward for going above and beyond in any regard, no matter what they tell you -all other areas of the restaurant will always be praised and appreciated more than you ever will -the turnover rate is extremely high. Only three people in the dish room remain from when I started. There has been a new trainee every week for the past month
Rude customers, busy schedules and constant demands
night shifts can turn into very long nights, especially on weekends
late night hours can be brutal
Work/ Life Balance is not the best as you are expected to work 10-12 hour opens or close shift
Picking up is not always guaranteed and there is a mandatory 'utility shift.' The hourly rate is severely affected by this required shift. (eg. the food runner pay puts you at the lowest hourly for all of the restaurant's positions)
No cons this is a great job and ahas great management
over worked, low to no breaks, can get very busy and hectic especially if co-workers call out!
It can be very hard work and longer hours. They can work you ten days in a row at times. It's usually 10-12hr shifts. Sometimes you close and leave at 3am, but you need to be back at 7am because you have to open.
Hired to many people when I started so I couldn’t get full time
Communication Breaks Easily Not Enough Hours Unsavory Individuals Sometimes Not Enough Resources
-had to do 2 “help” shifts like runner or breaker, that alone is terrible -late hours -terrible clientele
Long hours but overtime is worth it
Got laid off during the pandemic
Not really any cons, just want to expand my work experience and skills.
As a public company, there are timelines and visibility into company specifics that will put pressure on the Finance Department to close timely and quickly. This is true of all public companies, not just Cheesecake Factory
The worse thing I can think of is management, for me is hypocritical. One moment everyone suppose to follow the recipe, than another moment rely on shortcuts.( depending if it's my shift or not). Too much condescending talk ( from supervisor to cooks) and poor performance due to ill feelings being held on throughout the day. Great people vs poor management.
Wanted me to come in after having treatments and I ended up passing out on the job. Then wanted me to make up the days after the doctor took me out of work.
Marble floors are a killer.
Poor management, high turnover rate including managers, they acted like no one was worth keeping, always out of everything, kitchen was so slow and rude. Worst job I’ve had.
The water was too hot to wash our hands. It was unsanitary.
Busy, alot of work. Not as fun as it use to be. Different employees.
Sometimes low staffed and backed up
Hm, very hard to recall any
nothing really that I can think of
Hired to many people when I started so I couldn’t get full time
Very fast pace. Customers are rude
Long hours, low pay getting yelled at
Communication Breaks Easily Not Enough Hours Unsavory Individuals Sometimes Not Enough Resources
Long hours but overtime is worth it
It’s not like what I thought it would be like to work at a somewhat expensive place, I thought it was going to be like “no reservations” but it ended up more like “kitchen nightmares”.
A very clique centric environment.
Fast paced, no time for breaks, management is unwilling to help unless forced.

The pay has its highs and lows, some nights you can be walking away with upwards of 200, while others you can be leaving with barely enough to cover a full tank of gas.
night shifts can turn into very long nights, especially on weekends
There are none! The weekends are the most money
Side work, co-workers, managers, always out of supplies, our supplies were a 3 minute walk away
It's hard to find them. So long as you stay focused on your task and work with empathy with those around you, the good outweighs any momentarily ""frustrating"" moment.

Benefits * Good pay (it was miles ahead of other ranges when I was job searching). This may be a con for you but there is an incentive bonus for hitting a certain percentage of billable time. I personally like that if I put the work in I get more money. * Can work fully remote * As of the end of 2022 still not much travel required, but that may change * Stock options * Flexible Time Off - the benefit of this is you never have to worry about running out of sick days and you get to access vacation time immediately Culture * The culture is fairly progressive * I like my manager * Generally everyone I meet is pleasant to work with and competent Growth opportunities * You can specialize in what you want. There are many products offered that have a different skillsets and challenges to go with them. You can mix and match. Learning new products is encouraged. * IPS (consultants) Management that I've interacted with has a view of maximizing growth and helping employees build their brand. * Networking and grabbing (virtual) coffee is encouraged. The work * The fact that you can focus on what product you want and get to work with many different clients keeps the work fresh and exciting.
The company has a great cuture and the nice thing is there is a good mix of newer people but also lots of veterans that know how to get things done. Unlimited vacation time but people take it unlike other places that switched to this policy and you look bad taking vacations.

","Not a lot of Cons
None. Top tier company in the enterprise data management industry.
Where to begin? -Broken or no processes at all. No strategies. - No training, hideous communication, and managers who won't support you - Same managers will set you up to fail on projects. If you don't read their minds, they blame you. They'll claim you're not collaborating or communicating properly when it's actually the reverse. - People are rude and unhelpful every day, but you'll get blamed -Double standards - Blurred job roles, and you'll receive criticism for not knowing or doing another role without any idea you were supposed to - HR is well aware of all the problems but can't do anything. - The CEO threw a tantrum on an all-hands meeting about people complaining that he forced them into a hybrid schedule. I remained remote and didn't understand the policy. Of course, I didn't understand most of the policies or actions the company took. - Though a software company, the only thing Informatica actually produces is misery. - They deserve negative stars, as many as a person can count.
Work is relentless but rewarding
Management is really bad and lacks diversity
-Work itself: You will be overloaded and burnt out quickly. No one can keep up and have a life at the same time. Not to mention, you will be expected to do junior-level work. This will actually take up most of your time and will leave little time for the fulfilling parts. And, when you do actually get to the fulfilling parts, it will be so rushed that chances of success will diminish. -Management: Management is under such pressure that you should be prepared to be micro-managed at every turn. But, also they aren't there to help and support you when you actually need it. -Training: Neither I nor my colleague received any training. We face constant pressure from management to excel in all aspects without any formal guidance. They don't tell you how to do anything operational and expect you to just figure it out and if your mess up because you're just trying to figure it out managers/leadership will be mad. -Communication: Communication is poor and your priorities are constantly changing but, too often I'm not told that direction has changed and then reprimanded if I'm not ""on top of it."" Connecting with Team: There is no room for personal conversations or connections at Informatica. It's literally all work and no play. Knowing what I know now, I would not accept a job within Informatica's marketing department. It's a mess.
informatica is a slow company that doesn't value its people very much
Pay is not per the industry standards
Felt very isolated working from home. More emphasis on team building would help!
You have a lot of support
to many changes in the company
Pay is not per the industry standards
This team rolls up to Marketing instead of Sales and this leads to mixed and confusing business goals. Very difficult to advance within the company from this position.
You have a lot of support
Too many priorities is burning people out.
Upper management can't be trusted
Exec leadership is an old-buddies network, when I left was not public (owned by PE) and no shared equity in success (at the time)
Internally, there may be too much permissiveness in letting teams self-direct their projects and programs. There is duplication in roles, internal tools, and projects because leadership doesn't back a single, company-wide solution. Surprisingly, too little top-down direction can lead to inefficient decision-making a resource assignment. Also, much of the company's employee moral boosting efforts are negated by hasty decisions to perform layoffs.
None, none, none, none, none
Seems to be a fair amount of churn in the management team.

bonus structure is ok - not fantastic
Bad cafe and building near lake.
Micro managing , convenient memory loss , managerial egos
way to many business changes it is hard to keep up
Very very few Billable projects across all projects. Managers/Executives upset people aren't working on billable work. Company is starting to micro manage time cards/ time allocations. As much as they talk about promotions. I've seen 3 individuals that should have been promoted and they never do. Training isn't practical
-Informatica is not an easy place for new sellers to do well given how broad the Informatica product stack is and the maturity in space. -Since early 2021, new sales management has up-ended the North American sales culture. Veteran knowledge is being cast aside by new leaders who don't understand the key differentiators of Informatica -There are lot of people who don't care about their jobs supporting sales -Whole-sale decisions are made without including a steering committee inclusive of everyone. The most recent of moving to industry vertical dramatically changed the work lives of many sellers and splintered relationships with customers -Leadership lacks effective KPI's for measuring success which means sellers have prospecting days to artificially create pipeline
Awful communication from higher ups
accounts seem to get reassigned frequently
Often works like a startup with often knee-jerk reactions from executive leaders. Very little cross departmental collaboration. People work in silos. Lots of office politics. Salaries not in line with industry.
Lack of communication/accountability between engineering/sales/product, opaque management, disorganized onboarding
hi, bye, sigh, night, cry
-Since there are a lot of groups over diverse geographies, local groups that are not near headquarters can get siloed . - not enough internal training on different groups and products within the company
Legacy Stack that informatica has to overcome
bonus structure is ok - not fantastic
Could offer better pay and benefits
Bad cafe and building near lake.
They have no loyalty for their employees. They talk about inclusion and diversity but it's not real. It's just a way to check off the box!
the pay is low and you're not told that you rely 100% on outbound prospecting, and you can't choose your accounts
Not a lot of Cons

* Flexible Time Off - there are restrictions around it. Only a certain percentage of the team can be approved for vacation at the same time, which makes the holidays a little tricky. To offset this sometimes the company grants time off to everyone between Xmas and New Years. Also there is a soft cap at 3 weeks. Any time off beyond that needs additional approval. *Healthcare is just pretty standard, but it has options. Though I came from a company with a very generous healthcare benefit so I may be biased. Culture *There is a lot of talking in corporate buzzwords at the C-suite level. It's just not my thing. *Sometimes different teams seem siloed in their individual focuses, which may don't always work seamlessly together. The work * There is a focus on hitting your allocated hours which can sometimes get in the way of just doing your job.
Big portfolio of products so there is a lot to learn when you start here.
Nothing to share as much
Product is lagging with the push to the cloud but given the complex nature of the software & vision it's not something I see being a huge detriment. Informatica still is the leader in the space all around.
None really great place to be
I was the only female of color on my team. My firing manager had no empathy and I had to get on anti-depresents and anxiety meds for the first time. He tried to fire me for 6 moths after a disclosed grueling custody battle. I was hired by leaders who left and he was new.
Bipolar structure and focus is easy more on KPIs than strategic sales
Not a lot of Cons
Constant changes of leadership and company strategy
Nothing to share now. May be later.
Seemingly constantly running into new deadlines, being understaffed, and pushing for more Unrealistic expectations and work culture, despite what's said in the culture at large about work/life balance and being aware
* Flexible Time Off - there are restrictions around it. Only a certain percentage of the team can be approved for vacation at the same time, which makes the holidays a little tricky. To offset this sometimes the company grants time off to everyone between Xmas and New Years. Also there is a soft cap at 3 weeks. Any time off beyond that needs additional approval. *Healthcare is just pretty standard, but it has options. Though I came from a company with a very generous healthcare benefit so I may be biased. Culture *There is a lot of talking in corporate buzzwords at the C-suite level. It's just not my thing. *Sometimes different teams seem siloed in their individual focuses, which may don't always work seamlessly together. The work * There is a focus on hitting your allocated hours which can sometimes get in the way of just doing your job.
Big portfolio of products so there is a lot to learn when you start here.
Nothing to share as much
It feels like they’re 2 (more?) years behind where they should be in their transition to the cloud. Some of this can be attributed their history of acquisitions, requiring engineering effort to integrate. But a reliance on legacy successes may have made them complacent. Not uncommon for companies with three decades of heritage - the innovator’s dilemma.
Lack of efficiency in software development process.
There is absolutely no training, and there are 40 or so different development teams with limited documentation. The culture is very Indian-centric, and therefore cut-throat and adheres to caste system within departments. Non-indians typically leave within 2 years for no advancement and not fitting in. Also no support during US days. Don't walk, run away from this employer.
Product is lagging with the push to the cloud but given the complex nature of the software & vision it's not something I see being a huge detriment. Informatica still is the leader in the space all around.
None really great place to be
The product base is large.
workload is extreme at times
Still to find but none so far! could be more competitive in compensation
Old school Slow processes Lack of open communication from above
Won;t make the money they tell you, the culture is terrible and wish I had known this before going in. Not sure I got the whole truth at the interview, they told me it would take a year to fully understand and by month 3 that was not the case. Many tenured successful people leaving. Its a revolving door and I was looking for something long term and after 12 months many people have been looking to leave. If you like pressure for not doing enough and then not making the money this is the place for you.
Time for promotion was long.
Salary is not very lucarative.
Some items that are still manual can probably be automated to avoid human error, as well as decrease numbers of missed deadlines.
I personally had great experience so I can't think of any cons.

Being a new starter during the pandemic can be daunting and isolating; this isn't the case at Informatica. Well done! The initial onboarding has been smooth with a buddy system and cross functions support aligned for the initial weeks. Self service onboarding system is concise and informative; wider teams are on hand to support and welcoming. You have ownership of your time and efforts; managers trust you to do your part.

Lot's of information to review and comprehend - can see how it might get overwhelming.
Overworked, product issues, silos between departments
Poor leadership (been a lot of turnover lately) Very boiler room Diminishing market respect ( a lot of unhappy customers) Old boys club
The market is in the process of fully understanding the investments Informatica has made in cloud based solutions.
No cons as of now.
I have yet to find any cons with Informatica
you will forget to use the unlimited time-off with work schedules
Nothing that I can really bring up
CSM customer load can be high Certain product issues made job difficult Pay not commensurate with book of business you’re responsible for
The only con I can think of is that you could probably look around and make more money somewhere else but I wouldn't even be interested at this point because I really enjoy working here.
Below Average compensation as compared to other tech companies
Promotions are few and far in between and most people I know are not happy with their salary

pay good good ppl close to home
-organized training program -good starting place to learn the basics -health insurance, 401k, complimentary Wellness Plans for up to 3 pets but have to pay for the tax from your check -discounted feeding program for cats and dogs with marketing rep (Royal Canin, Purina, Hills), free flea/heartworm prevention with marketing rep -opportunities for growth with the company is available -transfers available since there are different locations in the US -
Definitely a good place to start off in the field
Overall a great place to start out if you're a new VA, RVT, or DVM. The daily structure makes it pretty easy to pick up routines and learn how to run tests, use the online software, talk to clients, etc. The best aspect for me is the associate OWP which provides completely free preventative care for your pets (spay/neuter, vaccines, exams, etc.)
owp benefits management pay organized
If you get a good doctor and a good pm, and they work as a team, it can make the job excellent
Great benefits Pretty good hours
great place, wonderful people there
Good benefits for the most part, although the health insurance is not great at all if you actually have to use it. Decent pay.
Good benefits Decent pay It’s ok for newly graduated techs & vets (location dependent) Ok hours 8am-6pm
Benefits Pto Leaderhsip Colleagues Work life
The 3 free wellness plans are great. They also offer health insurance, PTO, and floating holidays for part-time employees. You get paid more per hour for working weekends and evenings (extra $1.50 on Sundays and evenings, extra $1 on Saturdays)
fun environment, rewarding, enables you to grow and learn at your own pace as you need, great starting place for newbies into vet med.
Supportive coworkers and lots of hands on work with the animals.
There ARE great clinics out there with fantastic PM’s who care about your wellbeing and mental health. There is room to grow if you’re willing to learn and put in the effort. You don’t have to overwhelm yourself either. 3 days is FT, so you can work fewer hours with benefits. There is always an end to the day and no overnight, working outside of work. Free therapy also!
great learning stepping stone for anyone interested in vet-med
-Chill laid back job that allows you to say hello to pets. -Great benefits and discounts to big companies.
Not much growth opportuntiy but good training and foundation.
-Decent health benefits -Very good pet benefits -Pretty flexible scheduling -Good environment when you have the right team
I have a great management team. Benefits are good.
Is the Place for Advancement opportunities
Every clinic is different. SOP indicates high standards. Good pay and benefits. Love the team at some locations.
Some of my coworkers and relationships I have made
Benefits are consistent and reliable. Forced to see 25+ pets per Dr per day and not able to turn anything away despite knowing the pet would t receive the best care when you and your team is overwhelmed with pets.
Always something to do, worked with small team, awesome doctors
Support, schedule, team members, clients, customer service

You get wellness plans for 3 pets and Royal Canine discount on food good place to learn
Benefits are good and available for part time.
You can get lucky with a good team and manager that are actually interested in supporting your development
Flexible hours, good benefits, decent pay
Working with pets is wonderfully rewarding. Most staff are great to work with. I have only ever met one arrogant/condescending doctor across 6 different locations in the past 2 years.
401k option on Day 1 of employment Access to free OWP as an employee Great learning experience for those with little knowledge of animal medicine
- pets - certain clients - team - learning opportunity
Nice office with plenty of parking
The core team (CSCs + VA + Doctors) worked very well together and had good open communication.
Flexible schedules Knowledge growth as a new person in the field Great team with strong work ethics
The first pro is a few of the people I met there I am still friends with. The second pro is that I learned a lot about medical care for dogs. But these pros could have been found at any other clinic
Structured, large corporation with good benefits
Easy job Flexible schedule shifts
Fellow teammates work hard and believe in our team.

The opportunity to learn from team members and *some* caring Doctors. Being able to learn new things almost every single day in the veterinary medical field, especially if you haven't had any previous experience. Being able to bring my pet in at any time for care. And of course, the animals.
Working with animals was wonderful
I get to choose my own schedule. I have an awesome team of hardworking, experienced people to learn from.
You can make good money
Banfield has a ton of benefits including free associates degrees after a year for full or part time employees, partnerships with Penn Foster, 401k, PTO, full medical, dental, vision etc. As a company they are incredibly inclusive and develop their associates.
Great benefits overall and staff is great

easy to apply, desperate need of techs, if you have a good team they will train you but there's only so much you can learn a preventative care setting
Amazing benefits, care about associates, fantastic place to grow your career with unlimited advancement opportunity
Good CE benefits, ok health. Utilize rvts. Good leadership is necessary for a good clinic

Being around dogs is pretty much the only good thing about this job.
Hey y’all I’ve worked at a few different locations and I can honestly say it’s not a terrible place to work at. The pay is decent at best, seeing cute animals everyday is awesome ofcourse and if you’re lucky your coworkers are awesome to see everyday as well.
getting to see puppies and kittens
Benefits are great You work 8 hour days
Had decent benefits, my practice manager was great. Loved the pet benefits and the PetSmart discounts.
Great for getting starting in the field.
-Flexible schedule -compensation is ok -benefits package ok
If I would have been asked this question 2 years ago I would have had more pros than cons.. The only pros I have is that the staff was very close and amazing at what they do. Yearly raise.
-Great networking between hospitals to help with support - Room for growth within the company
Great benefits and growth potential.
Get to play with puppies all day
Great benefits. Great pay Always hiring
You will learn a lot
Best practice manager, great doctors
","Some are open Sundays and all on Saturday
hectic envmt lots of work
-NUMBERS must be met every quarter as a corporate setting -Patient overload for each doctor combining drop-off appointments and in-room appointments -Every location varies depending on practice manager, chief of staff and lead
Not much room for growth, or to learn more then the basics
There is a relatively high rate of turnover so there usually isn't a set team at any given location for longer than a few months.
selling owp hours days lack of raise no paid CE
Corporate pushes blanket rules for all hospitals, no matter what they are doing or how they are performing. It stresses out the team unnecessarily.
Underpaid Work weekends Veterinary assistant turn over rate is high
the hours are long sometimes
You can be an outstanding vet tech, but if you don’t sell enough wellness plans, you will be considered less than dog poop in the end. You can preach the heck out of preventative care, but if you live in an area with clients struggling in this recession, then good chance you won’t make your numbers to be deemed worthy even if you excel in every other area.
-unable to perform quality medicine due to overbooking -you will be ashamed in the work you do and be constantly fighting to practice properly. They will throw 20-30 patients at you and expect you to get them done. -terrible learning environment (atleast at my hospital). Misinformation about practice was spread all the time and if you try to provide feedback or helpful tips, you will be hated - a lot of gossip and work place drama
Really hard to find anything wrong.
The hours are absolute garbage and upper management is constantly pushing staff past their limits. They only care about the number of pets seen and have continued to push drop-off appointments because it maximizes the number of appointments per doctor every day. This can make owners (rightfully) extremely frustrated, and leads to a lot of miscommunication between owners and staff.
long hours, labor-intense at times, clientele is not the best, fast-paced
Have to work at least a few holidays even if part time.
There are a lot of clinics that are not healthy to be at and that don’t have great leaders. Unfortunately, you may not know until you start. Benefits packages could be better, as far as coverages. They offer a lot though. The could give better benefits to people who are there. Raises are coins on the dollar unless you get a promotion.
overscheduled, not enough staff, very much corporate and treated like children
-Often feel separated from the team. You're in a world of your own in the front while you get to hear your coworkers have fun in the back. -No sense of job accomplishments. Nothing to work for until your review.
Career growth is not much of an opportunity
-Corporate Business (money focused) -Having a good manager helps but usually the district manager makes working at Banfield very hard, no support to managers from corporate which affects the whole hospital. - Underpaid/over worked - This company does not reprimand or fire people when they no call no show to work regularly, which impacts daily workload on employees that do come to work.
Need higher salary for more experience. Making close to same as new grads.
Too overworked for little pay
Not given the time or resources to maintain the SOP standards. It's a machine cranking out numbers. Staff and patients sacrificed for profit.
OWP they suck. I am not a sales person, I am there for the pets
Low pay for seasoned tenured employees, high turnover, corporate atmosphere pushing numbers, job threatened over Wellness Plan enrollment.
Not enough staff for the demanding schedule, too many phone calls in-bound and out-bound, corporate expectations way too high, too many reminder calls and emails annoyed clients
Pay, advancement, hours, management, guidance
- High amount of calls and understaffed at times - Some angry, entitled and stressed clients
Short staffed all the time
Work environment bullying, low staff, overworked, etc.
No hours, get sent home.
Lots of corporate expectations that sometimes don’t relate to the reality of the situation.
hours cut regularly, work weekends and holidays
Toxic management, inconsistent hours, short staffed, and so much more.
Fast paced environment. Can get stressful at times as with all medical jobs. Regular in person meetings. Work life balance can be difficult.
BURNOUT this company prioritizes numbers of membership signups and pets per day rather than quality healthcare, its emotionally taxing when pets are treated as numbers no matter how hard you work no room for growth, but the worst of all are the clients, you will be yelled at everyday by them because in this job the customer is always right even when they are demanding free services or are an hour late to an appt, the manager will bend over backwards for them and enable this behavior just for a quick buck, you will not have any work/life balance, random shifts given to you the pay is better other places
Big business and not always great communication through the management chain
Abysmal pay, mediocre benefits, no work life balance, no support from higher management
Mars is scumbag company who puts profits before people in all their businesses. Usual corporate BS for DEI. Training process kinda sucked.
1) Recent (2023) changes due to recession has resulted in a cut in hours to the extent that some employees only work 2-3 days per week, and not by choice, so many have taken on an individual responsibility to scout hours at other locations to feel financially secure. 2) The culture promotes mental health issues as we are encouraged to behave as machines while participating in emotionally difficult situations such as euthanasia and 11-12hr shifts. 3) Management greatly impacts your comfortability, and poor management is common, as practice managers are saddled with too many tasks. Good luck knowing what your schedule is more than 2 weeks at a time.
Long hours (shifts up to 11 hours) depending on what region/what shifts the PM dictates Chronically understaffed because PMs are advised by their FDs to cut hours or send people home if they don't see a specific # of pets per day. DVMs are graded on how much money, on average, their clients spend per visit. They are advised to recommend products owned by the Mars corporation (Royal Canin) Too much focus on profits and selling OWPs
- pay - rude clients
Poor leadership has led to an IT department that just spins its wheels. HR only protects the C level execs.
-pay was not great -practice managers did not know what they were doing most of the time and were not supportive. -overworked -company only cares about seeing as many pets as possible with no concerns that hospitals are short staffed, overworked, stress, verbally abused by clients. -the little bit of money they give you as a ""gift"" to their Banfield store is really a slap in the face. I'd prefer $20 to target so I can get something essential I actually need since they don't pay enough. -they literally never ""fire"" a client, even when there is multiple documented instances of clients being abusive I mean the list goes on and on. I appreciated the job because it got me through a rough time and sometimes you have to take what you can get, but honestly, they company could do soooo much better, they just choose not to.
Knowledge cap after a certain time Too many steps to fire hostile clients High pet ratio with low support
You will be burned out. There is no punishment for other employees for being late or calling out every other shift. Management can do what they want but you can’t. Very hard to move up. Each DVM varies, you could get a very nice and knowledgeable one or work with one with severe anger issues who makes a lot of mistakes. They refuse to pay a fair amount not only for the area you live in but also compared to your coworkers. The only people who benefit are bad workers because they will never be fired and everyone else has to pick up for their slack. Not to mention there is bad patient care. I would never let my pet go to a banfield unless I was her nurse. Ever.
Short staffed, and then they cut hours when production is low. Unstable management. The 401k is an unvested employer contribution meaning Mars Corp will take out their contributions they made when if you leave the company before you are fully vested which is disappointing.
Busy days when multiple doctors
Leadership is absentee and has no transparency. There is little to no direction or insight into our future. It comes down to the boys/girls club. Benefits keep dropping, and there is no indication things will get better. No consistency from team to team on WFH/Hybrid roles. Some people must come in daily; some are 100% WFH; others are hybrid. Many get no choice or option about where they can work, while others get whatever they want.
Lowering standard of care No DVMs= no hours and crappy hires
Wage gap among colleagues despite experience
Everything is terrible. Don’t ever work here.
Big business and not always great communication through the management chain
Working at any corporate company always has pros/cons. Management seems to be lacking and some doctors working here are unable to properly treat or diagnose. You really can't provide great care due to the unrealistic number of pets the company requires staff to see in a day.
There is really nothing positive I can say about Banfield as a whole. I could list pages of the cons.

- pay - rude clients
Very little pay for the work that you do. Go elsewhere in the Veterinary field where you're more appreciated. It feels like Banfield truly cares about how many healthy, OWP members are scheduled rather than true preventative care. They are all about numbers, unfortunately. Under-scheduling. They will work you like a dog and will send people home early when there aren't enough appointments scheduled for the day. Not good if you're living paycheck to paycheck. There is favoritism in the work place and it can be toxic, especially if you had a vision of moving up in the company in the beginning. Certain Doctors have a bad attitude some days and it can take a mental toll on you. Untrained dogs will work you physically, just be prepared. If a coworker is not up to speed, you are expected to pick up their slack. If you aren't scheduled to close, you just might end up doing so anyway and will get scolded for staying past your scheduled time. The hypocrisy is real at Banfield. Unfortunately due to this, there was no real work life balance. You're expected to work at 7AM up until closing time which is around 6:30PM. If you're not closing, you'll most likely be off around 5PM and do it all again the next day. On your days off, you'll most likely be catching up on rest.
Working with the manager was awful
Bitten, scratched, rude customers, untrained animals.
The only thing the care about is making money and how to make as much as possible. Older doctors are brain washed into thinking the best medicine is recommending every single test just to make as much money as possible.
Low wages. Unrealistic goals for clinics. Slow moving tech support and slow moving technological advances- they can’t even text clients directly from clinics, and the online scheduler is a constant source of client complaints and disengagement for staff
Cooperate , cookie cutter format for training
Too many appointments and very understaffed at times.
Wage gap among colleagues despite experience
Everything is terrible. Don’t ever work here.
Busy and some customers expectations
Long hours can be a lot
Working at any corporate company always has pros/cons. Management seems to be lacking and some doctors working here are unable to properly treat or diagnose. You really can't provide great care due to the unrealistic number of pets the company requires staff to see in a day.
Overwork No overtime pay even if you are actually working overtime
Toxic management, money hungry and driven
There is really nothing positive I can say about Banfield as a whole. I could list pages of the cons.
Every location runs differently, no accountability for doctors, extremely metrics-driven

treats patients and clients like this is fast food veterinary medicine
Sometimes expectations can be a bit high, but that's the nature of the industry
Corporate is always about numbers just like any other Corp company
Mars has a bad record of child labor so you know the bar is low already Management in banfield is a hot mess Issues come from the top at every location You are a number and will never be paid what you’re worth Vertical integration everywhere They care about sales and speed to the determinate of medicine done correctly. Environment is toxic for those who care about pets and vet med
Even if it is a veterinary office, Banfield is a company at it's core. Unless you are making their numbers, it is not a company I recommend staying with long term.
Overworked Understaffed Micromanaging Un-organized Manager ensues drama, talks about other employees to other employees. Manager does not have deescalation skills, she is the source of most drama Dr talks down to staff, including manager. Is allowed to get away with it because we are short vets. I was targeted because I’m from the North, and treated differently. Made to feel like an outcast. Clients not happy with management, the store, and company as a whole. Manager does not stand up for employees
Dealing with mad customers about their past due balances
Not a lot of cons - corporate medicine
No work life balance most of the time
Rare to get or be offered overtime, lots of call outs, you may struggle to move up. There are some unrealistic expectations of the team.
Bad Management that doesn't appreciate there employees.
However the entitlement some client have coming in wether it’s because their an OWP client and think that means they become #1 priority over literally everyone else, or when a client doesn’t disclosure all concerns until the very last minute possible, we go through regular price changes which sucks because we’re meant to be affordable. Most locations are striving for numbers which is dumb in my opinion because the numbers don’t reflect the best care we can give. It shows how fast we can churn out our animals and how many, but at the risk of lowering our quality? Big turn off.
dealing with some angry customers
Lots of work not enough pay Work every weekend.
Hours are too long, constantly having to push Wellness Plans.
Management is not constant. Trained to do things one way then a different the next. They will pretend to listen to concerns but nothing is ever followed through. Puts too much pressure on number of pets being seen over the quality of the actual care .
-pressure from management to produce -corporate structure can be slow to see changes -higher ups feel out of touch with reality
Revolving door- three different managers in 5 years, I could not tell you the amount of hires that I saw come and go. The corporation began shining through very quickly, it felt as though the staff was not appreciated and were over worked and then some. Pets were not receiving the time and care they deserved because higher ups were more concerned about the number of pets they see rather than the care they were able to give. Cliques began to form with in the staff and if you were not friends outside of work then you were left out of everything even with in the office and your opinions no longer mattered.
- Practice Managers are not valued nearly enough by any level of leadership - Your local leadership can make or break your experience within the company - Work life balance can be a huge struggle
Cookie cutter approach does not allow for location or team adaptations.
Very needy not trying to help grow
Leadership Changes frequently as do the rules. Whiplash trying to keep up with the unannounced changes. Hectic work conditions, low value placed on mental health of employees
You will get thrown into the fire to learn a lot
Spend a lot of your time there

employee personalities are actually very easy to get along with and become like a family
Worked here for over 5 years and loved the staff and management. Everyone worked hard and had a great attitude. Kitchen staff was on point and and made food quick and with consistency. Great for first job in the restaurant industry. Attracts a great variety customers being at a mall and fairly close to the airport. A lot of opportunity to learn different positions.
Lots of money for a relatively easy job. Always opportunities to work or take more hours, incredibly flexible scheduling and understanding management. Fun people, caring manager, decent tips. Other locations that are busier are better money makers and more professional but my location is slow.
Very fun job. The menu is large but easy to memorize. My training was very thorough.

I worked at Outback for about 3.5-4 years while I was in college, and honestly it was pretty good compared to other serving jobs. I got a long with a lot of my other coworkers, who were all college students -- also there for about the allotted rate I was. I worked about 4 days a week, we had 6 table sections there & I made pretty good money. $150-$350 depending on the night, There are a lot of servers and help shifts on so it made my job easier. Everything there is electronic, including like window screens -- so its easy to keep everything straight. Because it is a chain, and I lived between states multiple times, it was very easy to change from chain to chain if needed. & my managers were always very helpful in that area, which I appreciated.
The job had its perks like discounted food, added tips at the end of the night, and the wage wasn’t the worst in California.

I have met some of the best people I have ever met working at outback. Management (at least in Viera, FL) was the best management I could ask for. I never had one problem and they would support me when needed. The work was a lot but coworkers would make the work a lot more tolerable
Fun and challenging. Good work culture. They care about their employees
Good food and concept, sets us up for success. Also I love the staff in my location.

this was years ago but really just no
They treat their employees well.
","corporate, strict working environment, long training
Can be stressful due to fast paced environment. Sometimes might get scheduled more than you asked for and vice versa.
Slow days can be a thing
(not necessarily a con) young employees
Not a lot of cons: customers can be difficult
More organized in the restaurant
It was slow sometimes and stuff
-Working with lazy coworkers -Management can be petty -Recurring and pointless online compliance courses covering the same information over and over again -If choosing to go into management, advancement and salary raise is extremely slow and/or stagnant -Tip out to other staff members is really high (total amount between 25-30% of your total tips and based off of an expected 20% tip amount from customers)
mean customers slow days mean no money
The managerial team at my location, aside from the two, at the time I worked there was overall predatory. I personally had a situation with a manager that happened on company grounds that was handled in horrible taste and other harassment rumors or incidents were completely ignored.
Burn out is very real. No work life balance. Managers are quitting as a result. Staffing has gotten much harder since covid. New service standards are not realistic if you are in a lower volume store making team retention harder.
More organized in the restaurant
poor management, poorly trained kitchen, just overall does not function well = losing out on tips

Can get stressful at times mostly due to clientele
- Salary could be inconsistent/fluctuate, entirely dependent on tips, which you receive a certain percentile of those tips, marginally less than that of a server of course - Prospective career growth within Outback Steakhouse could take sometime, your ideal goal should be establishing yourself with experience in order to maybe become a assistant server/server
raises are shut off , huge amount of favoritism from management good employees are overworked and underpaid for the amount we have to take on i've been told by management we were supposed to get a raise for each station learned but i've learned 3 and no raise also management doesn't know how to talk to people and won't help if they see what speed your capable of they will run you into the ground also a huge one is working a double till close after working till close saturday on a busy night along with improper training of employee and managers one manager teaches one way and says not to listen to the other managers then the other says another and says the same thing they should all be taught proper procedures we lose so much money in remakes because something was rung up wrong or someone took the wrong order usually the same people over and over with 5 extra items in the window because they didn't look for the item before they asked
Hard to become full time. Limited hours.
Hard work but that’s expected in a position like this.
Working at a steakhouse means higher rates of food being returned to the kitchen which is normal. Its a large chain restaurant so value of hourly employees is low.
rude customers lack of servers
Poor management, often very disorganized
Their new System takes 6% of your tips so you’re left with next to nothing
Perform many duties that you are not paid for, duties that are not in the job description
Ignore your requests and overschedule you. Management has a hard time taking action on problems and instead rather overload employment.
Had its slow seasons, a lot of people don’t tip.
Management was okay , environment was good
Fly through proprietors It all went down hill after they fired the original proprietor Seabrook clientele is absolutely terrible

There are some people who want the tv's back but there are the ones who sit thru entire games and not spend any money.

Parking is in the mall, so during some times of the year it can be hectic.
Tension between employees, rude customers, unprofessional workplace at times. Tip out to hosts and food runners is a decent chunk of money, but they help a lot.
Large menu and the uniform is not necessarily the most comfortable
rude customers lack of servers
It is pretty slow in the summer time.

You are obviously going to have to deal with some corporate BS working at Outback. Corporate managers coming in every month or 2. Interesting management at times. Tasks to fill the time.

Working in chain restaurants is not great in general. Outback steak house is no different.
It is pretty slow in the summer time.
Management could be a little chaotic
The company doesn’t take very good care of their managers, they no longer care about connecting with the community.

- management has favorites - lack of supervision from servers - scheduling difficulties (lack of shifts)
Not consistent cashflow, especially during slow seasons.
Slow days can happen but it is what it is
Not a ton of room for advancement unless you stay for a while
Not many cons nice serving job
Favoritism and nepotism, constantly running out of stock on things, but most of all the tipshare is just terrible
The culture has changed and their focus has moved from people to profits.
Inconsistent schedule, but this is standard in the service industry.
The proprietor is not a not nice person and communication is very lackluster.
low hourly, weekdays suck for tips
- Lack of breaks - Irregular tips given
There is not cons for this job.
Cant think of anything negative
Management was either ineffective or absent. Causing a toxic work environment we’re accountability was nonexistent. Maybe things have changed
Working weekends, and holidays is tough but it is worth it
The management team is terrible
Low per-hour wage and unreliable income.
They make you watch videos periodically. One of them saying that as a white person you’re not allowed to say that you treat all races the same because that would imply that racism is not real.. not a big con but what am I supposed to do?
Owners and systems in place.
Many hours walking. I bit stressful
Management has favorites Fired for no reason Management threatens to fire you
I personally have none, it’s the best place I’ve done dishwashing for
Too many weird hours not fit for having a family
Benefits could be better for hourly employees.
Hours can be long sometimes
- no benefits - never consistent with employees or employers - hours fluctuate all the time - stressful
Short staffed during COVID. Takes time to move up to a server.
The people are annoying to serve
The pay wasn't the best
It was always hot everyday
No company cars, Limited PTO
Difficult customers at times , slow kitchen on Saturday night
not a lot of money, someone people end up making money tho. others don’t
There are no cons except you work for tips.

work life balance: they don't have much work to do. That's why people are slack off here.
Symantec is an international software company that services some of the largest companies and governments in terms of AV and Backup solutions, but since it operates mainly in enterprise settings, many entry level job seekers may not be aware of how large and influential Symantec is. It's an excellent first step for just about any IT professional that might have larger aspirations of working for Microsoft or Google later in their career. Pay and benefit compensation is quite fair for new IT professionals, while seasoned workers will enjoy certification and higher education reimbursement to further round out their skill set and improve their pay grade.
Great people, managers, team environment. Great sense of purpose in what you work on in keeping customers safe online
Great engineers. Good middle level management.

micromanaging managers, poor schedule, poor hours

Very slow to change old processes or adapt to new ways of working
Work life balance sucks. Management is always pushing you to meet deadlines
They provided stock to sell
- Shared engineering resources - Can be tough to work with widely spread global teams
After acquiring Blue Coat and bringing in some some outside investors the company changed it's focus from excellent products to the all mighty dollar. Benefits were cut and senior people where let go in the pursuit of cost savings.
Very limited career growth poor management
Doesn't grow your career enough
Overall outlook not optimistic, lots of structural changes
After the company was broken up, and the remainder downsized and redirected, it is hard to know whether the culture of the future will stay similar to the culture of the past.
Management changing, low salary, acquired by Broadcom
The workload can be overwhelming & sometimes you’ll be on the phone with one member for hours at a time
Not really a con but, virtual onboarding can be a tad daunting, however, there are so many people willing to jump right in and assist you.
Low pay, inexperienced management, few professional growth opportunities.
The company is turning into Consumer focused for just two years. Some of the productions is not yet clear to predicate. It might also affect sponsor if you don't already get H1B yet.

CEOs and other C-level management change frequently causing other changes ripping down. Salaries are OK but not top-notch. Frugal budget for many things.
no cons all good teams managers can be good
Management can’t execute strategic plan. Diversified businesses. Layouts due to restructuring.
sometimes not much to do in terms of work. Not many ways to progress
Never ending layoffs were stressful.
Focus on top and bottom line
You need to network for growth, still career growth is slow. Can be sent home anytime
very frequent leadership changes at the top level
Constantly changing leadership makes it hard to build great software when directions are always changing.
Not too many perks at Norton
You never know if you're going to have a job the next day, and at some point you won't. The cuts are frequent and unexpected, even coming after directors and managers explicit say they won't happen. The technologies are mostly outdated and there are no incentives to improve it. Upper management are mostly trying to keep the ship from sinking, which has been happening for years already as they can't seem to find ways to modernize what they sell. The CEO of the Company has as much understanding of Software as the end user to whom their selling their products. It's definitely not a place to thrive if you have skills because the people who can promote you don't understand what you're talking about most of the time.
Horrible work culture. Office politics at it's best.
Nothing much to say so far
VP, SVP levels are not operational since quarterly goals to wall-street are hard to achieve within the context of the competitive environment, an expensive product and the lack of ability to innovate. As a result, senior staff are busy pushing unachievable targets to one another instead of running the business.
No continuation is offered after the internship
Not Bad but boring from time to time.
IT had too much control of the systems. There were Sr. Exec personal opinions that prevented IT from taking business requirements and having an open thought perspective on the best solutions.
Expect to have to fight for a raise. Layoffs have been a constant thing for years. Very slow to implement new changes.
Lack of vision and miss an huge opportunity to lead the industry.
* Company changes direction regularly, leadership is very questionable at the top (especially Gagan) * Especially negative sign: much of the company's top talent has either been laid off or has left voluntarily * Seems that top leadership doesn't really understand the market they serve, and doesn't have a clear plan to gain what they've lost to the competition; buying Avira will not solve the long-term problems of this company!
- In some instances things could be planned out farther in advance but that can be said for any company.
Competitive atmosphere will either make or break you. Symantec has grown to twice in size in less than 3 years after the merge with Veritas so there is now a mixed culture of both old and new culture which is both good and bad. The stock is no longer as fast as it was a couple of years ago when there was a Virus Outbreak almost every month. There is also a misperception of secured PCs becuase of the new OS features of Microsoft which gives ordinary folks a false impression of being secured. IN short, we are not as ""hot"" as we were before.
Horrible advancement policies leading to inequality in the same role for tenured employees General lack of stability within the company as it figures our what it wants to be when it grows up. Very ""who you know"" or ""luck of the draw"" when it comes to getting a good leader to work for misplaced priorities and the tendency to work their people dry in come depts Very emotionally lead leadership, resulting in LOTS of hip-fire decisions and changes Not a lot of appreciation for Work/Life balance They don't do a whole lot to honor and reward loyalty They REALLY don't know how to build a great culture (Its not just a slide deck, folks!).
Nothing to specify, great place to work
Frequent management changes, work life balance is not that great
There is nothing that I can tell as Cons
- Company has switched CEO twice in a short period of time, and company is lacking consistent direction. - Marketing and sales seem to have a less-than-adequate understanding of the products they're pushing and has no idea how to pitch their products. Lacking in at-a-glance product overviews that would normally entice customers. - Getting to the appropriate sales reps for buying and renewing subscriptions can be a nightmare for customers. We get angry, frustrated customers wandering into Tech Support all the time. - An unfortunate disconnect between departments. - Bloated list of products that need to be consolidated. - Some product development teams are don't attempt to cater to customer needs. - Too much unnecessary spending by upper management that takes away from.
No cons wonderful place here
Ever changing senior & executive management Routine layoffs the last 5 years
-Pay -the job itself (on the phone with customers)
1. Very old projects 2. Stupid ideas 3. Some managers are really not technical 4. Some architects are really arrogant 5. Could not learn too much new tech here 6. Super low salary
Because Symantec has grown quite a bit through acquisitions and breaking into new markets, there's an enormous number of individual teams supporting and selling different products. Previous Symantec leadership embraced these micro-climates of skill and knowledge which has created some confusion on just how large the company is and all the things our various departments do. Recent management changes aim to fix that, but there's still quite a lot of difficulty when trying to have open lines of communication from one product group to another, support to sales, or frontline support to development. Because of this, necessary changes to how things are done feel sluggish.
Every year or less it seems there was another set of layoffs for the entire 8 years I worked there.
Too many to level executive changes.

the metrics change every few months, but as long as you know what the company’s goals are the benefits are great and pay bonuses can be good.
Good pay and benefits commission is easy to get
Comission is ok but market is saturated
Not much anymore. This used to be a great place to work
You can make some good friends
Teams tend to be smaller and all have their own culture, but in general this is a great place to work. People tend to be happy, helpful and compassionate in addition to being willing and capable teammates.

Great team, some managers are great to work with.
Pay was decent for job
- coworkers - learn in skills to use somewhere else - pay, just make sure to save
Pay/people..I loved both. Too bad everything else sucked.
None. Don't consider a role in IT. It's no longer a team working together to keep old and unsupported hardware alive. It's a constant fire drill. Promotions only occur for those incompetent people don't ever deliver anything but know someone at the top.

Opportunity for rapid advancement is exceptional. Benefits are very appealing. Depending on role, flexible work schedules are available.

Its great when people are in the mood for security and see just how beneficial it is plus the commission plan isn't bad when your selling.

great hours, great benefits, worthy company
Love everything, could be more pay, but I’m kind of greedy
Great department to be apart of. Once you understand what your doing. Management works with you for time off.
get to make your schedule (for the most part), unlimited commissions, you get to work from home a lot, you get to travel the state pretty frequently, easy work if youre good with people and good at sales/following up, you can (sometimes) make a lot of money very fast with minimal effort
Potential to make a lot of money is there, Customers are sometimes really pleasant. You can offer a lot of deals and discounts to customers. Work life balance is decent once your in the field your on your own for the most part of the day.
Other employees are nice and helpful
Build you own Schedule will not give you company appointments
Good pay Benefits Work environment
Great place to work. My supervisor and manager all really cared about me and wanted me to succeed. A lot of Opportunity to win prizes. Pay was decent for the area.

I learned everything I know about alarms, working for ADT thanks to my colleagues, reading manuals, and practicing with live equipment at home. It was a good experience that I recommend for entry level technicians willing to learn.
Good hours and work life balance
Most of the people You will learn quite a bit as it’s a pretty intense learn as you go program 24/7 so you can choose any kind of schedule I was full remote Overtime If you have questions or can’t solve a problem there will always be someone who can help The leader over tech support There’s so many different roles to fill at this company that if you end up hating tech support there will something you can switch into
Low job requirement, company vehicle
I work mostly in the cloud and love my team and the environment overall.
My starting pay was great.
Money is here. Just takes building a pipeline full of people
The benefits they offer are great. The training team I had was great also.
The money is very good
You are given company appointments to sell security systems, cameras, ect. There is some flexibility with your schedule
Plenty of overtime available at all times.
Great environment and great support Great pay and benefits

Great managers and coworkers, flexible schedule.
This is a work from home position with equipment provided. The pay is really good for an entry level position. Each month you receive a 50c raise until you reach the highest pay for your position. You are able to switch departments after 6 months of working for the company. If you are late for work you can make up the time that same day but staying on the clock for as long as the amount of time you missed at your initial clock in.
Brand recognition, everybody knows ADT
I work mostly in the cloud and love my team and the environment overall.
Lost of support from upper management and peers
Always plenty of work. Too much work most of the time and not enough employees.
Managers were always helpful Training was great Flexible shifts, if u missed a day
","None as of right now
To see what is out
No same day installs Physically demanding, only a plus if you enjoy sweating/being physically active. Just a lot of walking. No gas/time compensation $250/w for training… Must have life together in order to start, not a job to get if already financially struggling. Start off pay is not great, training pay should be more, to compensate gas/time (you may not make many sales the first few weeks), to encourage workers to stay & get the experience (if new to sales) that way by the time they learn, they will take off and not have to struggle, again, not a good start for someone extremely down bad/single parents.
Lots of managers but no leadership or development to speak of. The company fights against itself. ZERO CULTURE. They are more interested in holding people back rather than get someone in a management position that won't just be a ""yes"" man. Force extra work days when most weeks you don't even have enough work to fill the day. All around poor management that has no foresight, no proactive thinking, not growth minded, and honestly doesn't know how to make things better. If you have no opinions, don't care about making money, don't care that everyday is a new fire drill of focus on something that really has no importance, don't care how you're treated, don't want to grow and develop then you might like it here.
Some factions in the company seem to fear innovation and cling to outdated technologies and collaboration strategies, and pressure other teams to conform to their technical paralysis. Managers make great effort to guard the autonomy of their teams, which is a positive counterbalance.
Difficult Coworkers who like to start drama.
In regards to my experience in working with Sales and HR . . . The talk of DEI is truly just talk. No clear direction and two of the lead people of the company work done in this area are White Males (only one of them has a quality of self reflection). The most effective work being done in the area was in an external facing function area that ended up hiring their own consulting firm. Another area that should have had the most important role in driving DEI is / was headed up by someone who was not sure how to defined success in this area and seemed to focused on responding to feedback of other seniors / excutive leaders, promoting the use of ineffective tools and processes and seeking reports from staff that have little to do with internal business partner requests / needs.
Be prepared for angry customers every company has them. Nothing is more irritating then when someone says I stole their money just to find out their debit card expired and they hadn’t paid in 6 months or called in or anything. And you have to be nice to rude people.
Poor management, no real room for advancement. Raises are annual but not everyone gets one. I was a lucky one who got .50 raise annually. I know some who didn't get a raise for almost 3yrs
Your pay maxs out at about $31 an hour in promotions which isn’t bad but the pay could be better
They keep your part that you need in stock for the jobs you are doing.
No stability, & too many stupid rules with dealer disputes
No one listens to local management. The only thing that matters is money. Customers come 2nd to profits and employees mean nothing. Forced overtime every weekday and forced 6 day work weeks. There’s nothing good left at this place. I can’t wait to find a new job.
The turn over rate is very high

This company is unorganized. I’ve sat through many training classes In my lifetime and this by FAR was the worst training class I’ve sat through. You’re collecting on past due commercial accounts. You would think collecting on 100,000 dollar balances there would be at least 2 weeks of solid training. Here their version of training is sticking you in a room for 2 days with training modules to complete online that teaches you very briefly how to navigate through numerous different softwares. And expects you to start dialing away on day 3. There were virtual meetings being held with people who have worked for the company for years and we’re still in knowledgeable about their job. Which was very weird to me. But then I was told even though you get hired at a certain title you can still get asked to help in other departments. For example you’re a collector but maybe you have hr experience as well. They can ask you to do hr work but not offer that hr pay. If you have a collections background and you’re fine with just winging it & learning as you go and NOT being properly trained to do your job then go for it.
management is unable to assist due to lack of continuous training with new products, company is acquiring other business without training its employees in new products they need to troubleshoot. proper departments for extended assistance for reps is Lacking in Knowledge. Management only cares about their incentives and not the customers needs.
Some micromanagers. Lack of PTO
Pay is low, split shifts, no work life balance, high turn over
Not a smooth on boarding process.
Upper management is all over the place, constantly changing pay plans, management pits sales teams, phone reps, and authorized dealers against one another. No one seems to be holding authorized dealers accountable, training for phone reps seems to be severely lacking. I spend a ton of time as a field rep cleaning up messes created by phone reps giving out bad information. I don’t get paid for that. As a 100% commission rep, I only do what I get paid for, but as some one who takes pride in my work and my company, I feel obliged to make things right for the customer. But there is no recognition or pay for that, so little to no incentive to go that extra mile for the customer. Plus, management keeps hiking up prices for equipment and monitoring to the point where we aren’t competitive. The only people paying for ADT now are the ones who want that name, but in reality, there is very little to distinguish ADT from their competitors.

Micro managed. Long hours, way too many changes, that affects the tech.
Management is a mess and slaving you
- Upper management, always threatening your jobs with emails like ""this a verbal to all"" or ""if you can't do it I will someone who can"" - Mandatory OT, but never notified with enough time. If you can't work the Mandatory OT, you have to use PTO! - Having to crawl in the attic in the afternoon when it's 110 outside and 130 in the attic - Forced to upsell, upset customers who have been waiting for weeks
I lost numerous family members this year. Then I lost my job...everything counts as an absence...including the 4 days I lost because their computer was not working.
Cost cutting layoffs have correlated into hundreds leaving on their own. Loyalty is not part of the culture. New CIO is playing Russian roulette by surrounding himself with direct report amateurs who contribute zero. All the while sitting back waiting for old, unsupported hardware that should have been retired years ago to crash.
Work Life Balances Non Existent, Success is Defined As How Well You Outperform Your Peers, Overly Micromanaged
The culture is a smokescreen, purely optics. I've watched the culture over the last five years go from a 10, to a 1. Why? Too many organizational changes, people are in a perpetual state of concern over their job. Finally and very objectively, the good 'ole boys club. People who perform poorly but have solid relationships with senior leaders get the nod for higher level advancement over those who perform at the top of the scale year in year out. This sends a TERRIBLE message to employees. This is not a one time incident, in my years of employment here I have witnessed it too many times to count.
management is unable to assist due to lack of continuous training with new products, company is acquiring other business without training its employees in new products they need to troubleshoot. proper departments for extended assistance for reps is Lacking in Knowledge.

When no one is buying you feel stranded and struggling to keep your head above water.
Long hours and long drives, management was a little vacant due to being on the road a lot. Very high volume. High standards and expectations

none really at the moment
Work life balance, time, management, customers not being home
Pay!!! Schedule change openings are rare. Pay, I was even informed by department manager that we would hear something about a department raise and that never happened.
doing a lot of prospecting which is unpaid work, youre going to put a ton of miles on your vehicle and the gas compensation does not fully cover it, theres no base pay or salary so if you dont have any of your sales get installed that pay period you dont get a paycheck, ADT is constantly hiring more and more people so the company given appointments are coming less and less frequently because they have to be spread out, sometimes the call center will schedule bad appointments and you waste gas and time driving out there for no reason
Commission only, leads and appointments set by company are usually trash. A lot of door knocking and cold calling. Have to be in office still, schedule different than what promised during interview. Sales aren’t consistent. Nights and weekends mandatory if you don’t hit weekly goals
Micromanagement. They constantly change policies and procedures. Every few months things are different. They listen to you between calls, watch how much time you are off between calls, and how much time you are on the call. There are a select few that make good commissions. The turnover rate is outrageous.
Management played favorites and gave all company appointments to same select few. Management will not train or help you out in any way, only wants you to generate your own leads
Long hours Bad scheduling department
We were dinged for canceling accounts however sometimes customers really just wanted to cancel and there’s nothing you can do about it.
Company doesn't support its technicians. Refuse pay raises, perpetual late nights, administration constantly finding new ways to make failures of its technicians.
Training is super long. It’s 9 weeks and the hours are long
Back schedule,the work hours sucked, and dealing with the management was sh**
none that I can think of
None I genuinely loved it here.
Corporate kept going around my manager and forcing new tasks on us constantly. I was incentivized to move slowly because if it even looked like I was being too productive they would have sales reps call customers and offer same day service without asking me if I actually had time for another customer. But I couldn't move too slowly or else I would be working from 7am to 7pm since there was always some major problem that would extend your day. And since they offer 4 hour windows that means I was usually annoying several customers later in the day because an early in the day customer had problems that the scheduling department would usually avoid writing down because that would mean they have to give me more time to finish the job so I can't do as many in a day. Nearly all jobs are only given a half hour to complete and corporate likes to act like that is more than enough time for most jobs. It is not. It is enough time to complete easy jobs which were maybe 10% of the jobs I got and it went down to 0% by the time I left because they started having easy problems get solved over the phone by a separate team. So they constantly over work their workers and act like their spoiling you with all this time they're giving you to complete the work. In all honesty I've barely scratched the surface on all the horrible things this company did (like the time they tricked the team into getting rid of the union by saying we'd get more bonuses and keep more of our money and then it actually got worse go figure).
Commission based pay High difficulty selling cold Door to door sales
When no one is buying you feel stranded and struggling to keep your head above water.
Long hours and long drives, management was a little vacant due to being on the road a lot. Very high volume. High standards and expectations
Mandatory overtime, micromanagement supervisors, and when when you achieve their 5 star goal they still tell you to do better.
The work life balance could be better
It’s a call center what do you expect? Hours can vary
none at the moment thanks

Management played favorites and gave all company appointments to same select few. Management will not train or help you out in any way, only wants you to generate your own leads
Mostly commission pay is offered
Long hours Bad scheduling department
Many times they do not have the complete parts to finish the jobs, there are no supplies to facilitate the work of the installer technician, you have to invent with what you find to finish jobs, and they do not give you good training to learn how to install, you have to improvise and learn by yourself, not even the technical support department knows how to install or fix many of the products that ADT sells. Another serious problem is the micro-management to which the bosses subject the technicians daily, which bores the technicians who feel exploited and do not want to continue working. This is why they do not have good installation technicians, all or most of them have left, and it is difficult for them to get new applicants who are committed and give their hearts to their work and the company.
Fast paced and angry customers
Call center with little to no down time 24/7 so you will work holidays Low pay Depending on your team you may or may not be severely micromanaged. You are your KPIs
Company doesn't support its technicians. Refuse pay raises, perpetual late nights, administration constantly finding new ways to make failures of its technicians.
Too many insignificant mandatory training sessions
They don't care about their customers. Alarm systems are expensive and customers should be trained on how to use or provided information that'll teach the customers. ADT has stats & goals for the agent to reach however there are also processes in place to hurt your stats, ie hae to seek approval to transfer customers or schedule a technician. The approval is almost never received.
Training is super super super long. No base pay
Make sure your offer letter says what your recruiter says over the phone. When I was hired, my recruiter told me I would make $20 an hour after 180 days. After being hired and going through training, everyone was surprised I was told this. It was not just me that was told this, it was my whole training class. They ended up saying it was just miscommunication and they couldn't do anything about it. Also, the shift differential pay was explained differently than how it exactly was. I hope this doesn't happen to another training class.
A lot of stress and headaches
Changing commission structures, product quotas(Google take rate), heavy push for self generated sales apart from company appointments
No sick days, each hour counts against you regardless of doctor’s notes or tests confirming illnesses.
None for me so far
Hybrid schedules Work at home at time can be difficult
Constantly changing comp plans, impossible budgets a bonus targets. No help from upper management as they are Constantly being downsized.
The commission structure could be better for sales reps
You don’t sell you don’t eat
Decisions can take a long time
Call center call volume. Tools given to resolve customers issues wasn’t great. Advised to try our best to avoid sending a technician.
No work life balance Training does not prepare you for production Calls back to back with only 10 seconds in between
Company politics, deceptive hiring practices, subpar pay for the job, heavy micromanagement and micro aggression.
None to report in my position
micro-management sucks really bad! More training for compassion would be helpful.
No cons to provide at this time
ADT is slow to react to marketplace needs & competition. Will create instability as that starts to hit financials.
Pitching to businesses which either have or have had ADT or other security companies making it uncomfortable talk to organizations.
Long hours, a lot of driving. And most of all, their way of firing people, on a quick phone call, without giving the employee a chance to defend themselves, from a racist, brand new employee. More Cons; I was attacked by dogs twice. One needed a ER visit and left scars. My brand new SUV burned to the ground, due to the batteries and supplies , carried in the vehicle. Company didn't compensate nor return my calls. Cons. Company has zero tolerance with violence, and protecting yourself.
Fast paced and angry customers
Call center with little to no down time 24/7 so you will work holidays Low pay Depending on your team you may or may not be severely micromanaged. You are your KPIs
Under paid, lack of communication and over worked.
Customers are very rude and disrespectful. They try to intimidate you over the phone. You do not have full access to all of the features and will sometimes have to reach out the your manager or your coworkers and they may not be available in your time of need.
Could do better with customer service
Too many insignificant mandatory training sessions
High turn over with the sales reps
They overwork their techs, mandate overtime, and micro manage.
Shift bid goes to seniority first

I think working with talented women was the biggest pro. I had an amazing team and I loved being able to share so many interests with people I would have probably never met besides in an environment like this.
Fun, beautiful place to go in to work. The work is straight-forward and I had good managers. I earned minimum wage which was ok but also sometimes surprising based on higher priced merch we were selling. The employee discount is the saddest thing to lose if you leave haha.

","Time off not usually accepted
Company will not pay for parking. You are forced to walk 1/2 hour each way to park in the neighborhood. Customers are insane. Poor organization, I was never properly trained and had to teach myself.
Management is lacking and job is boring
I think the push from upper management and higher ups to become knowledgeable in styling was such a dumb campaign when quality control and push for sustainability was a much bigger need. What better way to push bigger sales than to mask it as a ""holistic styling experience."" Nah, as someone could see business KPIs i was so disappointed working for a company who was bringing in that much revenue but could over and over just throw away damaged product and would rip off other designers.
Customers can be silly or nitpicky but many are really kind and fun to help find something they love. Wish there had been more opportunities for backend organization to advance into. Can't say it's diverse but that's not what you expect Anthro to be.
Some managers Some key holders Customers
As a lot of retail, really changes based on your managers/location. I worked at a location in the Midwest and then California—the Midwest store was run much better and there was far less turnover than the California store.
You are constantly asked by managers to buy Anthro clothes to meet their sale quota for the week and you really don't make enough to do that but feel shamed for not buying clothes from anthro.
HQ doesn’t care about the smaller stores. Managers just hang in the back. They aren’t active on the floor
There were no tips even though it’s a customer service heavy environment
Low pay and long hours on your feet.

A lot expected from outside your role, abusive customers.
There weren’t any great environment
management was really inconsiderate about calling out sick
Only pays minimum wage starting out, even if you’ve been there for a while there aren’t many raise opportunities

Minimum wage and customers weren’t always nice
the work load is asking a lot for an hourly employees. it’s hard to find and keep support to make the job easier. and a treat is getting an extra project you don’t have time for.
Only pays minimum wage starting out, even if you’ve been there for a while there aren’t many raise opportunities
-People are kept at low levels for too long without promotion. -Everyone is doing work that is far above their title and pay. -The pay from one employee to another with the same title is not consistent and feels random. -There is not much room for growth with promotions or raises. -Super long hours caused by too much overlap on huge deadlines and teams being severely understaffed. -A lot of the work we spent long nights and weekends on would be just for reviews with the execs or C-Suite, and would never make it to stores so it felt like a lot of wasted personal time.
Minimum wage and customers weren’t always nice
corporate is rude and inconsiderate of the work you put in looking for a neat and finished look? no time for that. If you are a perfectionist or appreciate craftsmanship, this is not for you. management and corporate don't understand the amount of work you have to put in on a daily basis have a creative idea? don't even try, they don't care for it. Just do what your told.
the burnout is too real, way overworked, unrealistic expectations and no one has a say in when it's too much. execs priority is making more money and thats it. low pay. underqualified managers with no time to train.

I found no downsides during my time at Anthropologie
Working retail is sometimes hard on the feet but that is the case anywhere.
Racist all white management that favors their white employees, toxic workplace, drama amongst the all female management and employees, no room to grow (if you are a POC), ethnic people are automatically assumed to be shoplifters and get followed around the store by staff
It is probably a better place to work as an associate than management. Managers have much responsibility and hours are long and you literally have to run the entire store for low pay. There was a bit of mean girl vibes from some other managers and a bit of obvious favoritism. This store particularly has a high theft rate so be prepared to play security and get blamed if someone steals from here. Closing hours were too late based on this particular location. As a manager you were expected to close the store in less than an hour with only two employees or else you would be reprimanded. Also be prepared as an associate to get hours cut significantly on slower times.

On-call shifts, early morning shifts

One downside was the inconsistent schedule/hours
Racist all white management that favors their white employees, toxic workplace, drama amongst the all female management and employees, no room to grow (if you are a POC), ethnic people are automatically assumed to be shoplifters and get followed around the store by staff
Non competitive pay, long hours, weekend travel
It is a corporation and often blanket decisions are made at the top levels that do not make sense when implemented at the local brick and mortar store.
-chronically short-staffed -low pay that is controlled at corporate level, and doesn't account well for cost of living differences (probably why always short staffed) -downtown location is not very safe at night when closing -while breadth of discount is great, it's probably the smallest discount I've had compared to other retail roles
With all retail jobs hours are difficult

District leaders are very disconnected to in-store experience Bare bones coverage due to payroll Long hours/late hours
-demanding clientele -management will most likely side with customer over you -some tasks become mundane -endless amounts of returns/go-backs
Schedules came out the day before the week started
Typical retail challenges that are not specific to Anthropologie, loss prevention and the occasional demanding or unkind client
Pay and sometimes gets boring
Often customers can be entitled or difficult Lots of physical labor when it comes to unloading shipment If short handed, work becomes more challenging
Sometimes you can only be self sufficient
Management puts their head in the sand to save certain positions they feel would be too hard to replace over those individuals bullying and harassing other employees. No proper HR investigations when a harassment claim has been brought to their attention. Employees are made to work in filth. No cleaning crews whatsoever. Employees are to do janitorial duties with no proper cleaning equipment and supplies. Pay is horrible and no regular reviews take place. Only management gets bonuses while everyone else is working so hard with no incentives. They want the world from their employees and they give nothing in return. Never enough staffing as the turnover is extreme. Bullies are ruling the roost and running everyone else out.
No preferences were given for opening or closing shifts
A lot of times you feel like decisions made by corporate for the stores aren't in the employees best interest. The bonus goals at competitive, high revenue stores are so outrageous it's hard to make bonus. They cut payroll so much that you always feel understaffed and overwhelmed. You feel like just a number most of the time.
The pay and short staffed
-working with customers can be difficult -navigating tensions in the workplace
You’re expected to produce a ton of work in a little time. The pay is laughable. District manager treats everyone poorly
Felt cliquy and didn’t feel like I could ask questions.
Even with effort, desire to learn, initiative and interest in growth opportunities, you are not noticed or seen as a potential investment. Management makes you feel like they're doing you a favor for allowing you to work there. $12/hr is the pay and that will not change. It amazes me how unfriendly and downright cold some members of management can be at times. I often leave work feeling sad depending on who I work with that day/night. How can you work with someone for a 6 hour shift and they don't say one word to you??? I have often greeted my manager with a hello and she either ignores it and walks right past me or says 'Hey' without even looking up at me. Management is a tight clique, like the mean girl group from junior high. I don't know why I stay there.
There are no cons to this job
Very much a revolving door
long days, jam packed store with people, lots of merchandise damage, heavy foot traffic
Management wanted you to do many extra tasks with no reward for doing them. Played so many different roles since I had been there for so long but was never compensated
not a lot of hours and minimum wage

Anthropologie is yet again testing a new formula for creating full time employee schedules. Instead of allowing autonomy and taking into consideration any sort of personal life, tenure, role hierarchy or work-life balance.... we move again to the most BLACK AND WHITE way of creating a schedule. Newer part time managers are expected to work EVERY WEEKEND within the new ""rules"" of the how the schedule is created. All other managers receive only ONE weekend off a month. ALL of the weekends off are set ahead of time with disregard to anyones personal life and needs for allowed time off.
long days, jam packed store with people, lots of merchandise damage, heavy foot traffic
I was not trained properly. I have to ask people a million times to be trained in simple job tasks but I won't be. It is so confusing I feel like I am out of the loop. I have been working here for a long time and I still get confused.
Management wanted you to do many extra tasks with no reward for doing them. Played so many different roles since I had been there for so long but was never compensated
Working with difficult customers, as any retail job does.
Horrible management - judgemental, angry
No flexibility in scheduling. Some management problems
Not a lot of opportunity for growth. There is a lot of turnover.
COVID-19 threw it for a loop a bit––was often requested to take last-minute shifts due to COVID-19 among the rest of the team. Also, at my location, there were a lot of technical issues.
The downfall of my location in Charleston was the poor camaraderie, gossip, and strictness.
The hourly pay is very low for the range of responsibilities you are given.
I really had no complaints other than how low the l registers are at Michigan store locations. If you are over 5’1 your neck back and shoulders with burn all day.
Boring at times, dealing with difficult costumers, low pay
Depending on who the SBL is (store leader), that can make or break the vibe. I feel like at my location, the SBL loves drama and likes to instigate so the rest of the crew fights. But when confronted about it, they don't accept responsibility! I would take this to HR, but Anthropologie doesn't have a secure HR line for employees. They have what they call NOWPREV, however, the people I would like to report, have access to the report! It makes for a toxic work environment.
Unhealthy favoritism and clique like environment. Too long of a duration to move up in the company.
Issues with scheduling and communication
the hours can be a little wonky, yet as long as you stay persistent with communication management usually does a good job getting you preferred hours.
on feet for a longtime
gets busy and hard to keep clothes organized sometimes
management can be disorganized which impacts scheduling
General URBN culture isn't great, but Anthro as a whole tries to encourage a good work environment
Customers from the area could be difficult
Don't forget to wear comfortable shoes
Sometimes can feel like higher-ups micromanage part time employees
Retail life can really consume you sometimes so you just have to keep a positive mindset to push through.
No personal relationships built with coworkers, low pay, onboarding was unclear 90% of the time
no cons that i can think of
Retail management can be a beast all on its own, but management at Anthro was by far the most unsupportive and gaslighting.
Stuck in fitting room for a while, didn't really get put up at cash rap
Lots of complaints from customers
expensive store to work at
At this time I dont have any cons
- Low pay rate for such a large corporate company - Pressure to wear company clothing during shifts (which is super pricey even with the employee discount)
the pay was pretty minimun

I appreciate the flexibility and unlimited vacation policy at Synopsys (if you use it, some people don't for some reason). The company also provides challenging work and mid-level leaders are very smart and are invested in their teams' success.
Pay is good for this job
There was lots of opportunity to learn when I started but unsure if that is still the case. There were still a number of great people left there still at the time I was let go.
Light workload (thanks to incompetent manager) nice environment and profitable stock options.
While I'm still within my first 90 days - I must say it has been an amazing experience. From the very beginning, the company culture and values have been evident and have been consistently demonstrated by management and colleagues alike. They offered a super competitive compensation package, including great benefits and flexible work arrangements. This shows that the company values and cares for its employees, which has made me feel more invested and committed to my work.

Unfortunately, the return to the office policies at Synopsys have been absurd. Some employees are being forced to go to the office to scan their badge even if they are attending an event outside the campus. The company's recent layoffs have also left many employees uncertain about their job security and the direction of the company, besides the fact that the company is growing and doing well financially, which makes me think that the measures if they were not doing good would be very bad for employees. Besides getting a good performance review, many employees (most of them based on people that share those things) got a 0% salary increase, in spite of the unprecedented inflation in US. Finally, some teams at Synopsys have a toxic culture that can be challenging to work in.
Need more PTO for employees
I started when the company was still somewhat recently acquired by Synopsys and therefore held a lot of the same cultural values. Slowly upper management started cutting off even my managers from any communication whatsoever to the point where we were finding out the most recent information (things as massive as acquisitions or major organization structure changes) from our SDR's below us well after it was put into affect. Also started taking away the ability for us to sell large portions of our portfolio, forcing us to turn away prospective client begging us for what was offered on the website, all while increasing our quotas by absurd amount. Upper management essentially cut our resources slowly over 3 years until finally cutting us all lose - they also gave the majority of the team (15 people) no option to take a severance package whatsoever and instead forced them to decide between quitting or taking a 'parallel' position in costumer support with less pay and no real sales experience.
it is rare to find a real technical knowledge and hand-on experience first level manager at Synopsys. The company can't attract talent engineers to work for insecure and incompetent managers. This results in great loss of good employees leaving and incompetent one would do anything to stay around. Majority of management teams are lost and lack of integrity. If customers are informed that Synopsys IP is silicone proof, please verify the information.
The gym could use an update along with the locker room. Between that and the cafe, it's your typical silicon valley office. So it's more nitpicks than cons. Management is receptive to comments and work flows at a manageable pace.
Growth Opportunities Lateral Movement Self Direction
Hard to get promoted to higher level
I have no cons for Synopsys
Does not have a competitive pay
Too soon to say anything.
Once hailed for job security.. That is also gone now. Very Risky to stay in development team after initial years. Yon neither become Tool Expert nor as Software Expert to compete in market. So long term career growth is not good
There weren't any downsides from my experience
VP, Senior VP, and above are disconnected from the people doing the actual work and are seem to be driven by Wall Street. They also have begun pushing ""Slideware"" (products that haven't even been conceived) as deliverable technology. The most recent addition is Synopsys.ai.
Overloaded with work. Work life balance is not great, worse since recent ""reorg"". Do not treat this as a 9 to 5, you will eventually have to bring home the work. The Burnout is real
Low compensation, not efficient management
Going away from the ability to work remotely
It has a passive work culture.
There weren't any downsides from my experience
Political environment, where women’s roles tend to be diminished while men advance faster RTO mandate, while professing flexibility Layoffs even while company experiencing record revenues Some leaders seem more interested in advancing themselves at the expense of doing what is right for the team and the company Slow decision making, with too many cooks in the kitchen People seem overworked, working in evenings, on weekends, while on vacation, while sick Discontinuation of Covid vaccine requirement even while pandemic continues
Lack of confidence and vision in middle-level management.
Average pay No work life balance Everything left to managers judgement no standardization across company
Innovation is difficult. Technical people kept at arms length from business which makes rapid learning cycles impossible. Workers in mid 40s and older are marginalized unless they have made shift to senior management or are at highest rungs of tech ladder.
Old building, lots of politics
Found no cons during my internship
Some of the remote teams are just toxic
401k match is low. Want workers to go back to office 3 days/week.
Work life balance is challenging.
Nothing which I can think of.
New management was pretty beurocratic.
very little cons, they are moving to more office time requirements.
- Constant re-organization - Forced onsite - Bad management

New management was pretty beurocratic.
1. The raises could be better. If the company tries to match yearly market comp + inflation differences, then I think workers would likely stay and not look elsewhere. 2. It can be a stressful job, in a way that you are handling customer issues and at the same time expected to continue learning new platforms, applications, etc. 3. You constantly need to be on top of organizing your priorities to ensure you can keep up with the work given.

The package is not big as you expected
Doesn't operate like a fast paced nimble tech company, very old school and antiquated
Limited collaboration and communication with colleagues due to significant time zone differences with a majority of the engineering workforce located in other countries
Not many that I've encountered. Company is growing rapidly, sometimes difficult to work at high levels of change and ambiguity.
Very WFH oriented, not everyone's cup of tea.
Management is uninformed and seemingly lost. There is no accountability or meaningful performance monitoring. R&D is an extremely political organization. There seems to be race-based hiring and organization.
Pay, old people, old stack (they are making progress to change)
None that I can think of
Experience and hard work not always fully appreciated
Can be frustrating for creatives at times
Can give more competitive pay
- AI teams work culture is hectic and sporadic. Many people left recently and some leaving due to poor middle management. - Arbitratory deadlines are set by middle management and everyone is expected to just deliver. Leading to burn outs. - Teams are geographically located in US west coast, France, India and Armenia and therefore planning is hard and people will ping you later in the night. - Work life balance: You are expected to put in more than 40 hours per week. They are very strict about it. - Communication skills are quite different. People talk over each, interrupt each other and will not waste a moment to point out your mistakes. Quite rude sometimes.
Little opportunity for advancement yes
Nothing to say. Good enough
Sometimes there might not be a ton of work available for interns
not very competitive in pay package

- software integrity group or SIG overall is bad place to be. - sales keeps pushing products so your work really does not matter. - pay is not that great nor are the benefits - we don’t innovate. Same old testing work that others can do for cheap. - SIG has zero knowledge sharing and no leadership. I was trying to get into the cloud side and the cloud leader left. It’s been a year and they haven’t bothered hiring someone. - we still use old tech and multiple tools that do the same thing. Waste of money. - poor performance is not checked. Anyone and everyone is promoted. Reviews cycles are a joke. - people are leaving in droves due to bad leadership and culture in SIG.
mediocre benefits and salary could be better
-Horrible work culture, rife with politics, both intra and inter BU, and between Corporate Staff and BUs (autocratic fiefdoms). Getting everyone aligned is like pulling teeth. -Lot of lip service about values, but no regard for meritocracy or real diversity. Bad politics is prevalent. HR is aloof to racial preferences shrewdly applied to skew promotions, for choreographing visibility to empower and nurture next level leaders of the preferred clan, commensrate with rewards & recognitions. Whats ironic is that Management even exploits HR diversity initiatives to double down on this to reinforce their own and no body can call them out. At this point this behavior is encultured across entire BU management chains — top to bottom, like a cancer — so there is no relief in sight.
The usual hi-tech company challenges - nothing specific to SNPS.
Lack of training SOP and short staff. No training but expect you to provide a great output in your assigned task. All tools are not user-friendly. Very manual and tedious work process.
management is chaos enough to become blockers
Lot of benefits, support your ideas, good customers.
Will not have complete silicon experience in few domains as it is EDA company

There are none that I'm aware of.
Cheap to buy into when starting

Repetitiveness of duties. Easy referrals for those looking for employment.
needed money to survive, got some
• Free drink • tips
easy and good hours while being in school
I worked there for almost 1.5 years and the environment was great our employer, manager was really great. Our duties was to handle the cash registers, stocking shelves, assisting customers with their purchases, put new deals and promotions in the store.
The customers were nice sometimes
everything it's ok, the attitude towards employees is good
-Free slurpees and hot drinks -Being able to get some cool products -Repetitive work

Really awesome management, you get to meet new people every day. Great work if you like being active and on your feet.
nice down time, talk to a lot of people
Room for advancement. Bonus potential . Flexible schedules .
You get to learn about the store and how it functions
Chill atmosphere depending on owner Work is straightforward, but plenty of optimization can be made to save time (I do 8 hours of work in 4 and have time to either relax or do tasks other shifts didn't have time to)
The customer are the best reason to work at 7-eleven.

Free car washes, fountain drinks and hot coffee while on duty.
Pay is pretty decent, I guess
Great place to work here
Free food and drinks I guess.
Pay is better than most.
When i began and before the buyout and they went corporate I LOVED it. As soon as the qcuisition ended we all noticed we were not at home any more. You are just a replaceable number. However, although the pay went down its still higher starting pay than most. and my coworkers were like family. as were my regulara
Good hours a lot to learn
Can have short shifts, not many things to do,
Pretty relaxed management, free soda whenever I wanted
I enjoyed my schedule. I was able to work from home four days a week. I worked in the office on Mondays, where I was able to socialize with the rest of the team., which I did enjoy as well.
Good boss great start pay
Working for 7- Eleven has great benefits like getting to meet new people and learning the regulars. It's A great company to work for.
I liked my coworkers. I had good consistent hours.
Loved working here, great people
Flexible schedule. You can be creative within your business. Monthly and quarterly bonus potential. Career opportunities for some.
you need something to eat fast 711 is there
was a good company to work for because of my store manager and my coworkers. had a lot of regulars so got to know them by name.
Good pay and snacks great coworkers

- Make your own schedule -Company car
No set schedule. Minimal management. Company vehicle.
Flexibility and Great Franchisees to work with
Always running! If you like putting out fires this is the place for you! Constant change for improvement and seasonality. Flexibility in your schedule.
None, it’s a gas station

7E isn't going anywhere anytime soon
Free food and drinks. Flexible hours.
flexible schedule, growth in company,
Hired quickly & easy job
Flexible Hours; Office Parties off location. Fun Employees
","none, it good place to work
Training for day-to-day job functions is little to none. Big opportunity for growth. Spend a lot of time putting out fires. It is an extremely fast paced company and you need thick skin to excel here...certainly not for the faint of heart- but if you enjoy these things and have a ""can do"" attitude, this is the place for you.
Getting harassed physically attacked by drug dealers, scam artist and gangbanger thugs and being forced by management to serve them
The employees were lazy and just didn’t care how the store looked
Dealing with rude customers, bad environments, and poor management; Depending on your location.
Rather not share as everyone has different experiences.
Not sure if I was fired for being attacked by the dumpster bees or something else since no one has told me I just recieved all my vacation time and what I did work 5 days from my last regular paycheck. No one has called me, texted me, sent me anything via snail mail or email regarding anything but I was attacked by dumpster bees, system went down and I made the decision to close for 2 hours while being treated by my local AMR team. Doesn't sound right
If your drawer is more than $5 short, it came out of your check. A co-worker of mine somehow got my employee log in info, which was just a 2-digit number followed by a 4-digit pin, and he stole stole hundreds. Altogether I was charged approximately $400 over a span of like 2 months. At some point they realized who was doing it, and they fired the guy, but I don’t think he was charged with a crime. It was a long time ago. Also, it didn’t pay well, they called me in on my day off allll the time, and I got robbed.
Somewhat bad salary for cashiers
Depending on your manager they could be a headache
need more flex time outside of vacation
I like working here. maybe rude customers.
After the mass layoff of 2022, majority of leadership left are weak. Very high school type of culture. In some instances, very toxic work culture.
Being the only cashier kinda makes your customers have to wait.
The job is not the most exciting and can be boring being in a cubicle
It can be stressful and disorganized
It is limited in store promotion due to store size. Dallas metro area experiencing rapid growth, producing new stores an d new jpb opportunities.
10 PTO days. unorganized company. many franchisees are negative and don't want to grow or work more. expected to do weekend visits and night/dawn visits once a month. your company phone has to be on since its a 24 hour business. Anyone can call you for an emergency. no home life balance due to this.
Have to advocate for good pay and decent raises. Harder to get good raises unless you leave the company and go back.
I have not had any negative experience working here
I done think they hire cons
- Expected to do the jobs of several people for minimum wage (cleaning, cooking, stocking, customer service and training) - No breaks (if you're the only one working there, breaks aren't possible). - Not allowed to sit down even when no customers are in store
Really easy you can get away with anything and get hired pretty much on the spot
Some weekend work is required
Did not receive any breaks whatsoever during entire 8 hour shifts. No lunch, water, or bathroom breaks.
Cannot think of any right now
Bad company Dont know how to run company
District managers will promote managers who suck up to them and then let them hire their family to be other managers. If you're not in the KLIQ watch out. Watched other management steal and district manager covered it up.
boring as hell, scary at night
doesn’t pay a lot and doesn’t have many benefits

Terrible contract, terrible people, terrible company
Some weekend work is required
Being treated like trash, mad if you don’t work when they want you to, can’t every be a few minutes late. Never able to ask for a day off and so much more I can’t fit here.
Cannot think of any right now
Customers Manager Shift start and stop times
boring as hell, scary at night
• bad management • payed below minimal wage (NY) • lack of premonition
doesn’t pay a lot and doesn’t have many benefits
First of all the behaviour of the customers because our store was located near a highschool so the shoplifting were a daily routine there. Sometimes the shoplifters were even ready to fight with the employees who tried to stop them so thats when i feel that it wasn't safe anymore to work there.
It was a okey place
low salary and many responsibilities, i would like to be paid a few dollares more
-Corporate is a huge busybody -Getting raises are few and far between -Making food all day that goes to waste

Treating there people with more
The dirty bathrooms and no call no show employees you wouldn’t be able to be relieved of your duty
Boss was a little stressful
Customers Manager Shift start and stop times
This is all dependent on the store. Also, while you get to meet new people, a lot of them aren't great.
terrible pay, bad stuff, no good
Work life balance. To many focus points .
The amount of work that there can be outweighs the pay
Online food service system Pay (depending on location) can be lower than fast food despite similar responsibilities Night shift hurts sleep schedule
The down side would be the long hours.
not a lot of opportunities
Could use a better maintenance system.
Treating there people with more
Barely any benefits Low pay
was very toxic, sexist, and overall a bad time
Very very long hours lol
It’s very busy at times. I wish there were more people to cover a shift. Even more so due to abrupt incoming online orders while you’re attending to customers.
Everything, no time off, treated like crap.
you are just a number, pay vs. what u are asked to do is not adequate.
As long as you enjoy no cons
Manager can be mean, they could care less about your personal problems, pay minimum wage, have to deal with rude customers a lot
Never got a lunch break
I should have spoken up when I was assigned and then kept in an area that clearly should have had more than one person assigned. Since I did not do this and I allowed it to continue, I quickly burned out trying to keep up with everyone else and I could not handle the additional tasks that were given because I was exhausted.
Limited overtime it has to be approved by the area manager
If You choose to work for this company, make sure you are getting the pay and hours you deserve.
People quit all the time.
Not a clean environment to work in
Can work long hours. Schedule can change at a moments notice. Last minute meetings or training sessions. Labor budget constraints. Raises can be very small or difficult to obtain.
add new products more slurpees flavor
every once and awhile had the sketchy ones come in
Community ( Homeless ) , environment
The amount of work that there can be outweighs the pay
-Disorganized at times -On call 24/7
On call most of the time.
Lack of training and career development
Poor communication, no leading by example by upper management.
Standing around, boredom, drugged out management
Very very long hours lol
As long as you enjoy no cons
The culture is toxic, but to be expected
peak times are super busy
manager was more worried about her life then her employees and customers, did not like environment, felt unhealthy and was off
Management was a mess & irresponsible
On Call; Double Shifts back to back; Floating position required operating a motor vehicle, but you are already tired, from working 1 8-hour shift. They don't give you the Shift that you want. I was stuck with the Grave shift. Bad or the Worst Cusomers possible.

","- can be hard to prioritize sometimes - lots of work and can be long hours, at times
No cons. Great place to work
Lack of handicapped parking. Air quality inside buildings are poor. Allergies start up within 30 minutes of entering building.
As with any cons that comes with working in a corporate company.
I was a direct witness to a campaign of retaliation and harrassment that was ignored by senior management. A manager was extremely hostile to their staff members and eventually received an HR complaint. These complaints are confidential - however this manager shared the complaint with their staff in an effort to identify the individual that submitted it. Their staff then began to ""investigate"" the matter and started harrassing likely suspects. This culmulated in an off-campus encounter where a Jewish employee was targeted with anti-semetic language and had a drink poured on them - with a threat of ""we know what you did and we're watching you."" This event was widely known to management, but no action was taking because the manager was in a critical project role.
Not a lot of work-life balance or ability to work remote.
Not much room to have own opinion, just follow senior leadership decision.
1. Hivemind 2. The Cult of ""Professionalism"" 3. Stuck in Pay Grade Hired Into (P1,2,3,4,5,6, etc.) 4. Very ""Cliquey""
Performance is not measured at all. Raises are weighted based on a bell curve across a team and amounts vary mostly based on where employees fall within the range. Perceived high performers may get 1% more but hardly significant to retain talent. Career development is non-existent. Extremely low accountability. Salary ranges trail the market (even heard some managers say its a good thing to see who's truly dedicated). Golden handcuff retention strategy.
Don’t be fooled by the rankings & positive spin articles, it’s a con. Loss of employees that haven’t been replaced means those left are doing work of multiple people; employees that left took historical experience & knowledge and since there’s no succession planning…;revolving door of contract staff (understandable, take what you’ve learned & get paid more somewhere else) so continuous training adds to burden of employees; raises & promotions based on subjective, political bias, (anything positive you’ve accomplished can be undone by a word); concern for employee well-being is nothing but hot air; and HR has mgmt’s back, not employees’. Expectations are do more with less at twice the speed to keep pipeline going and stock price moving up. Scratch below surface, it’s toxic.
The work and life balance could be better
There are no cons at this point.
Low pay compared to industry standard.
very burocratic, salarywise not the most competitive, stagnant in terms of growth and development
After giving many years of service I was given a separation date for not receiving an experimental inoculation. For that my time was cut short.
I quit because of my manager
Not many complaints good skills
It’s a very large organization
This does not apply to me.
The job was taxing and against some morals
Upper Leadership is lacking and could be better
Terrible / clueless management. No stability for employees.
Developing and growing might need favoritism
Sometimes there are those who are stuck in doing the the old Lilly way,it's slowly changing, but still present.
Limited work life balance which depends on where you work in the company, not sure if the pay is competitive
Can sometimes be hard to change positions
As a contractor you might be doing better than employees but without the benefits they receive
None that i can think of
There was a lot of driving but compensated for it.
Too much hierarchy and politics.
Many priorities at once, sometimes conflicting.
1. Management wants complete control and fishing for info form everyone 2. Thick politics, friend over technical expertise Too political correct and merely a show than focus on science 3. No free of speech at a department at LTC N 4. Boring and inflexibility on work 5. Back stabbing happen at all time 6. Lack of working integrity 7. It is INDIANA 8. Lots of M3 leverage “political correct” influence from higher up to grab and climb and never care about people below
depend on group. My group is too intense.
Work culture, management and growth potential
Growth was slower to achieve
Bonus structure could be better
seems like internal promotions can take several years so most people go external from department which doesn't bother me but may bother others if they really want to stay in the same department
Lots of red tape and pain points
I can think of no cons other than market access.
Lots found but I can't say
Lots found but I can't say
Brilliant people come into the company but are slotted into roles which do not fit their talents. Management training is inconsistent from team to team, and more than a few are unfamiliar with how to manage individuals more experienced or knowledgeable than themselves. Sadly, I have seen many talented people be discounted, get fed up and leave to work for companies willing to take the best and brightest regardless of their characteristics differing from the norm. Lilly, back up the talk with actions. Stop promoting for 'the right fit' when you mean 'my pal.' Train Management properly BEFORE they develop bad managerial habits. Many of the high performing employees of color I started with at Lilly have left. If things don't change this year, I'll be one of them.
low pay, and some managers are not very good
12 hour shifts aren’t for everyone so
Some decisions are not science based
Sometimes thing s be that way
Sometimes you have to work late or weekends because it is a regulated industry and you never know when regulatory inquiries could be received.
Location- Indianapolis ^ that’s basically it
hard wor kand support science
relatively poor management/leadership in some areas not much space for growth
Highly political. Some leaders are horrible to their people, yet keep getting promoted. I would still be there if it wasn’t for my last manager, who drove at least 6 good people out of the company. Working for her was once described as like having “daily colonoscopies.”
Pay is still a little less than desirable compared to other Pharma companies
Easy to get lost in all that is taking place, too woke
Too bureaucratic, individual performance is faulted by team performance. Constantly changing pay structure to pay high performers less
Partners and Managers Were Bad
Very cheap. Doesn’t pay commission for well, the company car is bottom of the line
changing culture, too much focus on diversity and inclusion and to the job
minimal flexibility with geography for most positions
Intense work place for some.
The BD function is redundant and disorganized. Every TA and function also have their own search & evaluation team members in addition to the BD group so everyone is tripping over each other with no clear delineation of responsibilities. It's also unclear for external companies whom to target for partnering discussions. While I worked at Lilly, not one but three senior-level executives were accused of egregious behavior with at least one of them being fired (the CFO!). Lilly is very adamant about the rank & file adhering to their Red Book code of conduct so it was very disappointing to see senior execs not play by the same rules.

There are no cons. It's great!
Long hours, weird schedule. Tedious
Compensation is not top of the industry
I am happy to work here.
Low salary, not keeping up with the industry.
Schedule is rough rotating days and nights
Like any big Pharma company, politics and conservative corporate culture is there. Some folks who work here had this 80s-90s business mindset, which I thought could be quite toxic for young generation entering the workforce. Because there is no Pharma competition geographically, many sometimes get away with unprofessional or behaviors that is not acceptable in the industry. In my experience HR didn’t take these behaviors or issues seriously.
Salaries are slightly below average for industry, although Indianapolis location CoL is lower than the coasts. Corporate leadership engages in classic corporate strategy of min/maxing resources and output for the sake of the almighty quarterly financial report. Many departments desperately need more personnel to address increasing workloads and throughout demands, yet headcount is restricted as long as possible to ensure that financial reports display ""line go up"".
not much you can say for cons
Difficult to get promotions. Many areas keep headcount to a minimum so work/life balance can be problematic.
- not a tech company. So has its own challenges
Like any other company you need to make sure you fit into the company culture. The culture will not be a fit for everyone.
Fast moving and consistently changing work environment, generally dictated by middle management.
You can be on-call at anytime.
location (Indianapolis) is not preferable.
Easy to get lost in all that is taking place, too woke
Too bureaucratic, individual performance is faulted by team performance. Constantly changing pay structure to pay high performers less
Location and many parts don’t have technical development
No specific downsides come to mind
The problem resides with most of the employees hired from the pre-existing company Imclone which was bougth by LIlly. Some do not understand the importance of following company policies and are making it very difficult for the good employees to survive.
its tiring and it gets boring
Difficult to get promotions. Many areas keep headcount to a minimum so work/life balance can be problematic.
No future for Postdoc researcher.

Talks diversity but doesn’t practice or apply the principles to promotional opportunities above a certain level.
Fast moving and consistently changing work environment, generally dictated by middle management.
You can be on-call at anytime.
location (Indianapolis) is not preferable.
No specific downsides come to mind
- the marketing department is very competitive to get into
They don't walk the walk - After a few years new employees will be hired above your pay rate, no adjustment due to cost of living. - Advancement is all political, even with glowing reviews you'll not advance without an advocate - No way to contact HR - you can't be yourself as it will be held against you - diversity is a one way street
The pay is very conservative compared to other companies
More empowerment is required, more freedom to operate
Difficult to advance if you start at the company later in your career. Somewhat passive / aggressive culture. Salaries tend to be slightly on the low side. Typical merit increases are 2-3%.
Training in new positions is lacking
Now - nonexistent work life balance, poor prioritization (everything is important!), inferior leadership at VP level.
so much much work to complete during weekend
CEO has a different approach in critical business decisions Lots of realignments

Lots of hours. Tips. And friendly work environment
I loved all of my coworkers, we worked together like a big happy family. If you work there, your job title doesnt define your responsibilities. Meaning, just because you're a cashier, doesn't mean you wont be taking orders, expediting, taking drive thru orders, making ice cream, etc. You learn to do it all.
At Dairy Queen I had the opportunity of hands on learning from a team member all the way up to General Management role.

Easy way to learn soft skills.
Nice people to work with
Great Discounts on Food Job is easy most of the time
There are none that I can consider as pros.
Good atmosphere working with great people but not enough hours they give you and no great benefits
The management was very good.
Sell good quality ice cream
Nice people but did not pay enough for the amount of work they expected
Sometimes its slow and you get discounted food
Occasional tips, liked my coworders
Easy Work Off time almost always approved
Easy job, decent pay and wages. Shifts weren't too bad.
Flexible hours, friendly customers, food discounts
Lots of hours. Tips. And friendly work environment
I loved all of my coworkers, we worked together like a big happy family. If you work there, your job title doesnt define your responsibilities. Meaning, just because you're a cashier, doesn't mean you wont be taking orders, expediting, taking drive thru orders, making ice cream, etc. You learn to do it all.
At Dairy Queen I had the opportunity of hands on learning from a team member all the way up to General Management role.
Good work place, easy to understand job
Friendly co workers and great environment.
It was a fun job as a teen because of the employees and customers

Loved working here , great environment and team work ethic
Easy to get a job there
Good employment communcation, always on task, good customer service review
","Long hours, low pay Sanitation
Management puts a lot of responsibility on crew members. They are expected to get things out of the drive thru window in 70 seconds. White gravy takes over 20 minutes to make and if you are in a rush and don't have time to make more, you get in big trouble (instead of a manager jumping in and asking what they can do to help). If the ice cream machine runs out of ice cream, it takes awhile for a new bag to start freezing to the correct texture and then you get in trouble because someone at the window is waiting for 10 different blizzards. Management thinks they have the right to tell you you can't have a day off that you requested over a month ago. When I was fully cross-trained in all 4 possible positions (Chill, Grill, DT, FC), I was promoted to Shift Leader and was supposed to get a dollar (yes, one whole dollar) for taking on new responsibilities like counting inventory and waste. It took them over 4 months to give me my raise.
It’s really busy at times.
Pay was low. But again that was in 2016 im sure it has changed
Cleaning the bathrooms are the worst
I do not have any cons from my time being employed here :)
During my last 2 weeks at my DQ location, the district manager told myself and other coworkers that we couldn't go to the bathroom during our shift, and we would have to go before our after our shifts, or while we were on break. Also tried to make us give them our phones if we weren't going to leave our phones in our cars. When I joined our general manager was really good, but after 6 months of me working there, our gm was sent to another location to improve their performance. We were left without a gm for about 8 months, and when we finally got one roughly 10 months ago, they stayed for about 1 month before quitting outright. We were stuck without a gm for another month or so before getting one that's stayed so far. But this new gm knew less than I did, so there were even more problems than when we didn't have a gm.
I have a long drive to work here.
Weird hours, random order rushes
Way to many Karen Customers
Way to many Karen Customers
Low wages and too much access to ice cream.
Couldn’t take vacation time may-august. They’d make me work even if I was puking/really sick. No benefits or holiday pay of any kind.
Unfulfilling and doesn't pay well
Messy place to work in my opinion
Sometimes, they were understaffed, and that could be stressful.
Lots of responsibility and pressure.
Overbearing management who prioritizes customers over its employees Customers who treat you like you are not a human being You will always go home smelling like grease and pickles or covered in ice cream or both Management making scheduling mistakes then blaming employees and calling people in on their days off
Gm picks favorite nobody trains
Told we’d be hired full time at $14/hr just to get 16-24 hrs a week at $13/hr. Brand new machines not working at full capacity and nothing has been done to fix it. A lot of promises not kept.

Tough management, not for the lazy
Soft serve is not really ice cream. Blizzard machine make your shirts sticky. Don't wear nice shoes.
Very busy at times. Training is emailed to you and you're asked to do it on your own time... So hrs of videos and reading and testing off the clock... Seems not quite legal.
Absolutely no cons to DQ
small town fast food so it’s busy
Not really any cons decent first job
you just have to deal with jerks sometimes
Pay needs to be increased.
Fast paced and very busy during OSU games.
Nothing really. Loved it there
Fast paced job , not for the weak
Not a lot of growth
Poor management. Owner chases young female workers
The pay is exactly what youd expect from a dairy queen
Long hours, low pay Sanitation
managers are either good or bad at communicating
Customer timing occasionally made duties harder.
Management can be awful at times
Long time standing on your feet, barely get any breaks

Not enough staff to cover all shifts
bad management and no growth potential
Management can be awful at times
The pay was minimum wage and didn't move
- lack of hours - micromanaging coworkers - fostering a cliquey environment
Unreliable shifts, especially in winter Customer service
Stressful sometimes Dealing with rude customers
all, to the best of my recollection
- Not too much room for promotion (definitely more of a part-time thing to do throughout middle school and high school -The occasional customer might cause an issue/get angry at you for a mistake or something out of your control, but that's probable to happen in any cashier/retail-esque position -Depending on your location, you might get the occasional sports team/bus that arrives in-store unannounced, causing a surge in orders. If the sports team/bus calls ahead of time, it's not terrible as you can prepare things for them in a timely fashion.
Working at Dairy Queen itself.
Managers would sometimes be very rude
You are working in fast food.
Occasionally it gets very stressful
Poor management and unsanitary environment
A lot of focus on drive thru time.
A lot of focus on drive thru time.
Lots of extra work if teammates slack
As with any service job, customers can be difficult to deal with at times.
Either really fast paced or super slow days.
Took too long to get raises. I started off at 9 an hour and it took a year and a half to reach 11.
Different locations could use some more training on how to Build strong company culture.
Can be slow at times
If you're new sometimes they're gonna ask you to do something that you're not supposed to, or if someone else doesn't wants to.
not the best pay to start
Shifts can be boring and low tips if there are no customers.

low pay if your older
Occasionally it gets very stressful
Only a few people do their job, low or no pay raises, paid the same as a new hire after working for years and being considered a ""manager"". Called a shift lead yet handed manager responsibilities, no flexibility, no schedule.
no benefits, lack of hours
A lot of focus on drive thru time.
AC unit don’t work properly
Not enough pay for work
Lots of extra work if teammates slack
Customers and managers were crazy
Job at my location is understaffed by design with only three workers in the whole building at all times. One for each station. Hours are not gauranteed
As with any service job, customers can be difficult to deal with at times.

Autodesk is also a tech business that is profitable with a really strong asset base, that continues to evolve and grow, a good long term employment prospect
The company prioritizes my learning goals and I get to work on impactful projects. Remote-first with great benefits
Managers and upper management listen and care. You learn a lot from working here and the work is really rewarding. You're a consultant more than a sales person and I love that. They really take care of you.

Benefits, Work culture, Compensation, Recognition
Family Friendly and open to work from home
I’ve worked for some great organizations and I can say that working at AutoDesk has been the best employment experience I could ask for. I am so proud to work for and with such amazing people who create an inclusive culture full of amazing opportunities to get involved and consistently grow professionally and personally. The pay is great, the benefits are better than than I could have hoped. Autodesk clearly cares about work life balance and creating a fun atmosphere where I feel included and appreciated. The management is top notch and the team running the Denver Hub are impressive, caring, intelligent, passionate, humble, and listen to the feedback from their staff. The workplace and office are also incredible and the team in Denver sets us up to succeed. The workplace team truly creates an environment that promotes professional and personal growth and allows you to be productive. The belonging and events are paramount to no other organization I’ve worked for including Nike. Sales quotas are appropriate and AutoDesk cares deeply about our customers and helping them achieve their goals and dreams. The projects we support in the industry are leading change for the better and creating a new possible. I love AutoDesk and hope to call this my work home for the rest of my working career. Thanks AutoDesk!

- Health insurance is pretty decent if you opt into the highest tiers - Health reimbursement was raised recently and pretty decent ($1k) - Some coworkers are both great to work with as well as great people - Great place to rest & vest - in many roles you can work as little or as much as you want and get away with it. If you come in high enough you don't have to worry about 0 upwards mobility. - Sabbatical is nice, 6 weeks every 4 years. IMPORTANT NOTE: this is DISCRETIONARY. You can be blocked from using this indefinitely depending on your manager's whims, I have seen this happen to others.

Very flexible and team-driven I have never worked anywhere where there is a lack of ego and people want to help each other and do the right thing internally and for the client. Overall the culture is positive many people work remotely and the reality is there is only so much you can do to include people digitally and help them feel a bond but Autodesk tries every way possible.
remote flexibility, some similar benefits to other tech companies
Work-Life Balance is really great
Independence, able to be a part of something REALLY cool, making significant difference in this world! Everyone is amazing to work with!
Flexible work/remote options, decent benefits, stock options, positive work relationships
I work with great people who agree that work-life balance and flexibility is important. I have never been so happy at a job before working at Autodesk. I love my manager and feel that the company’s mission is important, and their culture is amazing.

Great company to work for and great WLB
Some of the new products are cool to the outside world, but 99% of company don’t work on them.
Great benefits and people. Technology is sound
Great culture and authentic leadership.
Everyone cares about each other from leadership, all the way down not only in words, but also actions, very horizontal feel. A lot of friendly people to work with. Cool products. Great movement within the company if you want to try other roles, this is encouraged. Office renovations have been really nice. Easy to talk to anyone in the company. Best culture, great benefits, amazing work-life balance. Micro-managing is not common from what I've witnessed.
Amazing culture, great benefits, If you are nimble enough you can create your position at this company.
Great colleagues and international business environment.
Autodesk has great people, love my co-workers, friendly and helpful environment.
You work with lots of smart colleagues at Autodesk Consulting. Also work with big name clients. There is an Ethics Compliance Hotline. Business as a whole is doing great.
Overall good company focused on leading with empathy and caring about the employees and current events in the world.

Coworkers and management always worry about your life balance. I get on on-calls and hear executives say ""get some rest""
Overall good company focused on leading with empathy and caring about the employees and current events in the world.
","Can be a little US centric in worldview (although APAC is strong) and Brand recognition is not yet as strong as it should be (the best company you’ve never heard of)
None that I can think of
Big company so moving up is hard. There's also changes every year due to acquisitions and changes in sales methods. Lots of changes makes it hard for everyone to catch up.
Nothing specific to point out at this stage
Slow product advancements and updates for customers.
Big company turns slowly. Network.
Large company so hard to get things moving
Depending on development team, focuses on too much at once Focused on development deliveries. Some teams struggle with costing extra deliverables (e.g. automations, testing, maintenance)
Upward mobility is a challenge
Not able to move quickly due to lack of leadership direction and ability to make decisions. You can feel like you are chasing your tail indefinitely. Not a good place to get things done.
No negatives as far as I'm concerned apart from the fact that there isn't an office where I live.
Low raises, slow to change things
We have a tendency to use consensus decision-making which can be slow. As such, we are moving towards a process where we identify who decision-makers are, engage in debate, and then support the decision even if it is a different one than we would have made.
I dont see many downsides.
pay and advancement are not easy here
In 6 months I have yet to find a single con.
It can be challenging at times to know who to reach out to amongst different teams/sister companies within Autodesk. Acquisitions of companies can take a long time for management and team members to adjust to.
I do not have any
Better positioning of the brand to drive more awareness and talent.
Aversion to risk taking Slow moving Stuck in the past
Autodesk is a hot mess. During the first few months of working there dozens of coworker admitted to having no idea what they were doing - zero fulfillment in their role, lack of structure and clear direction, too many internal meetings, zero idea how the sales compensation plan works and exactly how they get paid by it - and managment included in this and very open about having zero clue what they were doing or how anyone got paid exactly, but encouraged everyone to just keep doing it (whatever that means) to get promoted and move into the next role. This company has a million ways to communicate, which is actually making things worse, and yet has zero efficient structure or organization to anything. This is the most liberal company I’ve ever worked for. They throw all the benefits, food, perks and rainbows at you, but it feels so fake and empty there. They give you a false sense of inclusivity, that is unless you’re different and then you feel extremely unwelcome there. If you’re Christian, steer clear because your faith won’t matter here. During pride month the building was wrapped in giant rainbows, every door with glass had rainbow decals placed near the door handle, and every tv in the building was advertising gay pride month…why sexualize the workplace?? Posting rainbows around like that is actually slander against my religion too - but that doesn’t matter to you. Imagine if the building were wrapped in Jesus fish and every tv had an invite to Bible study on it… yeah, same. I’ve never worked for a company that felt like you’re just thrown into a heard of sleeping sheep going with the flow but not understanding a single thing they’re doing.
- Travel (Could be a perk)
Global company so all teams and organizations have diff time zones and hard to navigate
Large corporation, sometimes decisions come down that don’t make total sense. Thankfully, leadership is happy to listen and adapt to our needs.
Work life balance not the best
There is not any kind of Cons in this company
Compensation can be lacking. Benefits are great, but these are not the same.
Equity values are lower than I’ve seen in other places
Can be a lot of complicated inquiries with custom work at times, which requires you to reach out to team members for help. Careful of burnout, just be vocal with your needs!
Changes happen often and very fast paced
Terrible management who will berate you within a month on the job. So called training is non-existent.
Top down management can be slower than competition
Lots of reorgs make it a challenge
Slow moving company. Very large.
leadership can do more to move things quickly
1. For specific organizations, leadership does what it can to hold you back. 2. It is MUCH easier to quit, work somewhere else for 1-2 years, and then apply and get hired in a higher position than to get promoted within the company. 3. This is the first place I truly felt ""micro-management"" 4. The metrics used are 100% based on how many issues you resolve and not the severity of the issues. 5. Getting bonuses, etc, different managers have different ways of assigning them, so under one manager I got 95%, and under another, I got 115% - for the same work done. 6. Managment wants to take credit for work of their employees, and put the blame on their employees when something breaks.
Promotion might be hard, depending on the team
The company expects you to engage and wants to appeal to your purpose to help drive you forward in your career - if you're not interested in doing that - then maybe somewhere else is a better fit.
Decision making is erratic Penny wise, pound foolish -- always driving to lower cost and not always has best value Chaotic environment, lots of ambiguity and start/stop projects
can not think of any
Some pockets needing more role modeling of the values from leadership
difficulty with internal application process
no cons that i can think of
Just had an acquisition - so normal growing pains
not much room to speak up while in a frontline role
some inconsistencies in management structures affected individuals' recognition/promotion.
Lack of clarity around job progression Salary isn't very competitive
They will not give you any room to improve and move up in the company if you work in client services. They actually treat you like you are not apart of the company when you are apart of client services section of the company. When others get time off you will have to work and they will designate another day off or say you have to work due to phones/live service being needed. They also can make you work there for years promising you if you work hard enough you can move up and make a ""career path"" for yourself when actually they will outsource your job and then let you go.
No down sides at this time
Pay not as high as competitors Still catching up to modern tech companies - culture, benefits, remote work, compensation
Disorganized management No ""one source of truth"" for reporting VERY Siloed company which makes getting anything done 10x harder. No virtual work culture, no effort to improve work culture. Company is trying to keep employees going into office, which the offices are super amazing but you have to pay $100+ for parking in an unsafe neighborhood (at least for Portland). Impossible to get into other roles, very difficult to progress. Managers are created out of convivence, not talent or leadership abilities. If someone has been there a long time, that makes them a candidate for leadership.
can not think of any
Some pockets needing more role modeling of the values from leadership
- Heavy amount of politics - Escalations: this is when someone else complains about you to their manager/leadership. If there is even a single one of these directed at you, forget about getting a raise or promotion that fiscal year. The escalation need not be legitimate either, the mere act of them complaining is enough to knock you out of contention. - Raises: they're not great, as you might expect from a larger corporation. They will give you 2-3% and depending on your manager, sometimes incredulously try to explain to you that its actually pretty good and you should be happy. Most people didn't get that 'much'. - Career growth: doesn't exist. Learning/lessons are supported and partially/fully funded in most cases, however don't expect your improvements to lead to large raises or promotions. Autodesk prefers to hire from outside for new/higher positions. - COVID Safety: they're not super good about this, CEO and many in leadership prefer working in person/office. There were many pushes to open the offices early and every time there was a COVID case on site (SF) in <48 hours. Many employees are unmasked in office, and will encourage those worried about COVID to also come in for the free food.
Just had an acquisition - so normal growing pains
Lack of acceptance of diversity and inclusion if outside the San Fran mindset. Avoid political discussions at all cost. They celebrate mediocrity so much that high performers leave. Promotions seem based on internal politics and cliques. Slow pace of product development.
some inconsistencies in management structures affected individuals' recognition/promotion.
bad management, very sales focused, lacking positive and supportive culture
Compensation is not very competitive. Positive change happens at a slow pace because there’s so much bureaucracy/red tape everything goes through.
Autodesk is so big it feels like a lot of processes don't always work the way they should and get bogged down with oversight, both internally and externally with customers.
a lot of middle management, innovation is not the goal here, and recruiters are understaffed.
Could improve on organizational transitions Not good with communication during organizational changes and how it affects employees Not good with direction, once transition is in place
Pay not as high as competitors Still catching up to modern tech companies - culture, benefits, remote work, compensation
Company over employed people and began limiting hours and trigger policies
Not much cons, had to do a lot of training
Pockets of groups acting in silos. perhaps this is due to insecurities stemming from less that capable/experienced people in roles that they are not yet ready for
Remote work can sometimes be disconnected
Legacy stack and bad culture
Some of your colleagues are terrible to work with and they won't fire anyone. I've seen engineers completely stop working for 6 months and it took that long to remove them from the team, insane.
None. It was a great place to work.

It is a large corporation so there is red tape to be expected when decisions need made.
bad management, very sales focused, lacking positive and supportive culture
Red Tape and hierarchy is too much
Huge silos, can make onboarding at Autodesk very difficult.
Compensation is not very competitive. Positive change happens at a slow pace because there’s so much bureaucracy/red tape everything goes through.
It might not always be easy to move up the corporate ladder here. I have heard they hire upper management more than growing them internally.

a lot of middle management, innovation is not the goal here, and recruiters are understaffed.
Nothing apart from ongoing re-orgs
Had manager with years history of HR issues involving verbal abuse. I didn’t know this history until I joined team. Team meetings were very uncomfortable, full of demeaning comments in front of team members. I went to HR multiple times, nothing was done. I tried to switch to another team for variety of reasons, and manager started targeting me and threatened to fire me and give a bad recommendation for any future jobs (I was early in my career so felt stuck). Eventually talked to another manager, who already knows about the years of history, and that person reported the various events they were aware of. Finally, my manager was eventually moved to another team to manage other people. This “solution” took years of at many people reporting to HR.
Sometimes can get lost in a big company
I genuinely don't have anything negative to say about the experience.
Not as great beverage options in the office, if you care. The data can be messy and silo-ed to work with. Things can take awhile to move along within work, since it's a big company and a lot of hoops to jump through.
It's a corporation and you can get let go at any time.
Colleagues across the globe worked great together and shared culture and friendship freely. Yet this San Francisco company always had some new hate to spread which only ever seemed to be the mindset of the bay area office. The company would be better off to ditch the wokeness which only serve to promote hate.
Management is disconnected from customer needs. Increasingly limited work/life, not many opportunities to connect with others in person
The DMs and PMs under Autodesk consulting are doorkeepers. The DMs and PMs block the business growth opportunities by using all kinds of excuses. Tired of the DMs and PMs' performative but hollow statements, since the DMs and PMs do not have any solid technical outputs to provide. Meanwhile the DMs and PMs do not allow tech consultants to meet clients in person for business developments. Full of bureaucracy dealing with the DMs and PMs. Even for project related travels, they are made too complicated to happen. There is a lack of trust between director management and the consultants.
So many silos. So many products. Reinventing the wheel quite a bit.
need to travel 2 hours per day and remote working is not preferred
Very siloed company that has rigid walls between groups. You have to learn how to play the political game within the company to advance. Focused on company performance over providing customer value.
Had manager with years history of HR issues involving verbal abuse. I didn’t know this history until I joined team. Team meetings were very uncomfortable, full of demeaning comments in front of team members. I went to HR multiple times, nothing was done. I tried to switch to another team for variety of reasons, and manager started targeting me and threatened to fire me and give a bad recommendation for any future jobs (I was early in my career so felt stuck). Eventually talked to another manager, who already knows about the years of history, and that person reported the various events they were aware of. Finally, my manager was eventually moved to another team to manage other people. This “solution” took years of at many people reporting to HR.
Sometimes can get lost in a big company
Colleagues across the globe worked great together and shared culture and friendship freely. Yet this San Francisco company always had some new hate to spread which only ever seemed to be the mindset of the bay area office. The company would be better off to ditch the wokeness which only serve to promote hate.
Management is disconnected from customer needs. Increasingly limited work/life, not many opportunities to connect with others in person
The DMs and PMs under Autodesk consulting are doorkeepers. The DMs and PMs block the business growth opportunities by using all kinds of excuses. Tired of the DMs and PMs' performative but hollow statements, since the DMs and PMs do not have any solid technical outputs to provide. Meanwhile the DMs and PMs do not allow tech consultants to meet clients in person for business developments. Full of bureaucracy dealing with the DMs and PMs. Even for project related travels, they are made too complicated to happen. There is a lack of trust between director management and the consultants.
Cant really come up with much
Sometimes priorities can be tough to juggle but that's the normal IT experience.
So many silos. So many products. Reinventing the wheel quite a bit.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Red-Lobster-Reviews-E153054.htm,"Good $ opportunity, tight knit team, smaller restaurant, flexibility
My Co-workers were great. Hours as a server are fairly short, unless you work a Double shift. My Mangers were nice. Most of our customers were nice. Locations across the whole USA and the world.
Some of the fellow coworkers
The team in my location is amazing. Management is the best I’ve ever had and there is minimal drama between the employees. Our coworkers get along so well that we frequently have dinner after shifts, we take small day trips, and we help each other out when we need it.
Working at Red Lobster taught me the ins and outs of food services. I learned valuable lessons about working independently, but also collaborating with a team
Very organized training program full of helpful procedures.
Flexible hours, you can work your hours and other's too.
GOOD WORK ENVIRONMENT AND FRIENDLY STAFF
- Cool staff - Choice of tipped pay or standard $16/hr was cool - Cool Managers - Not the hardest job tasks
They train you and willing to, easy to get along with coworkers. You can request time off easy as long as it's 2 weeks in advance.
Free and discounted food at the end of shifts
The benefits are good. I have worked for the company 11 years and have 4 weeks paid time off.
Flexible schedules, opportunities to move up in company. Several locations to work at.
co-workers are family here. This is a very tight-knit group but once respect is earned you are forever apart of the family.

great pay and tips nice
It’s okay I enjoyed hanging out with the staff
People are great,tips are great
Location is great. Coworkers were friendly and management was on top of everything.
Really good tips, you can often make $30+ an hour, at least at night, which is better than almost any other entry level job. Management was pretty good when I was there, but definitely played favorites. I know it's changed hands mostly so not sure who's there now. JP probably is, and he was the most fair and level headed in my opinion. I never wanted to stay there but there was always managing opportunities if people wanted them.

Benefits Coworkers Managers Food Hours/Shifts
Good money, decent food, easy work
Working as a bartender/server was good money at the time, especially for someone in school. The goal was to always make $100 in tips a night, and it wasn’t hard as long as you were consistently having tables. Busy nights averaged $150-$200. Get a routine and stay consistent and the job isn’t hard
The managers are nice and are hands on when things are low
Great management, flexible, friendly team
What I enjoyed about working at Red Lobster is that the managers were always willing to step in and help when needed. Other servers were also willing to help when they're free. There are many long-time servers there too. Many of them being there 5+ yrs! Everyone is assigned their own section, hosts will seat customers in order so that servers wouldn't get skipped out on. For the most part, I was always tipped well there. I even found another serving job someplace out but ended up returning back to Red Lobster.

","Annoying team members and (as in every restaurant) and sometimes inconsistent money. But the good days make up for it!
They Micro Manage the heck out of you. They time your table turns and want you to turn them in 45 minutes and that's at dinner time. There is very little help there and now that they have all you can eat shrimp everyday, it really affects service in a bad way. If you get a Secrect shopper when the restaurant is busy you're probably not going to score well and if you get two not good Secret shoppers you're fired. The Managers are absolute labor crazy, to the point of ridiculousness . Our restaurant was pretty dirty do to them wanting us off the clock asap so we had no time to clean the restaurant properly, just quick slip slop cleaning.
Was made to do 3 different jobs. While wearing long sleeved black buttoned up dress shirt and pants. Ran all over the place having to bust tables before you could sit anyone. The waitresses never busted their tables. You got paid 3.25 an hour. And had to split tips with the waitresses so it would equal 7.25 an hour and they hated you because they had to give you like 6% of their tips. You had to clean the bathroom, clean the lobby, clean the lobster tank, clean the windows and on top of that be burning up bc of the uniform. The only time you are ever appreciated is when you are off for a day or two and then come back, but even that is short lived and only last a day. I worked 40+ hours a week and my paycheck was never over $250 a week. I busted my butt every day I was there so the long time manager could sit in his office playing solitaire. The only time you saw him was when he came in, came out for lunch (order the most expensive thing on the menu) managers eat for free, and when he left for the day.
Unfortunately, the corporate-level employees adopted a new system where we have front servers and back servers. The company can’t pay their own employees so they have the front servers tip out almost a third of what they earned that night, and for a tremendous butt kicking, this makes working a lot less worth it.
It seemed that management struggled to keep us in the know. After being gone for a couple weeks one time, the menu changed drastically and no one gave me a heads up and filled me in, I was just thrown into the deep end. Also, as with most serving jobs, the less than $5 an hour pay isn’t enough when people don’t tip well. The lack of consistent scheduling and inconsistent pay is what eventually led me to leave
There was a lot of management turnover in my last few years with the company.
Most all food is now prepared in the microwave. The company is cutting corners to the point they will eventually cut their own throats. Good employees are now expected to do their role and an additional role or two during a single shift for the same rate of pay. This was not the standard previously, there were people in place to make sure the shifts ran smoothly. And don't expect management to be any assistance. They're too busy chasing their own tails to care enough to do anything about it.
No cons working at red lobster
- The busy days get BUSY - Bad customers on occasion make it suck - Very specific manager made it worse for everyone. Hmm.
The way they handle shifts is not good. It is very disorganized.
Dealing with rude patrons but that comes with the job
Constantly understaffed by management. Corporate does not care for the people. Only profits.
Hours and lack of sick time. Expectation for managers was to work while sick. Hopefully that has since changed.
New GM is a hot mess and always has attitude or is yelling at someone. Most of the kitchen speaks Spanish and minimal English. Spanglish helps.

some customers can be very entitled. there are servers and food runners. you will take turns with both positions. Managers play favorites and treat employees unfairly.
long wait on food cooks
The cons are that sometimes people don’t tip
Should get rid of gm
Serving here is not as stress-free as other places. As a server you are given a lot of responsibilities that can add up and make you fall behind even if it isn't very busy.
Lots of drama in the kitchen and with servers. Sometimes managers were very strict.

There was a recent shake-up at the Corporate level affecting the every aspect of the company- While I'll stress that my experience within the changes in and around the Eastern Tennessee areas were amazing in light of the pandemic, staffing, pay, political everything- they did everything they were capable of to be upfront, and reasonable to the teams whether they choose to stay or leave the company. No ones perfect and your store is only as strong as your weakest link and there's plenty.
I really have no cons.
None really. Good place to work

Poor bonus structure. Tenured leaders are targeted to save on incentives. Lack of trust, fun, and decency. Workload is to much along with micromanagement. Turnover at a all time high. Lack of positivity.

-hours were very limited and there was a big overstaffing issue while i was there -no growth available
terrible scheduling Corporate so customers always right no matter what
Stressful, very fast-paced, pay varies
Corporate is out of touch when it comes to what it is like to work in the restaurant. Presto reviews are taken a little to seriously. Customers are horrible, the worst I've ever dealt with. While the money is decent the way the customers treat you makes it not worth it.

Some night can be slow equaling no money, Disrespectful customers
Pay is not as high as it should be as I work as a busser
same as any other restaurant, some customers are trash some are great.
GM was on his way out the door and wasn't very good with employee relations, staffing issues were persistent

Lots of politics involved with employees/managers
Mistreatment from customers. Long hours
people are not on time
Customers...sometimes, Slippery floors, Lifting heavy things
Management did their best but left some to be desired
There are lots of tedious things about the job, the biggest about bartending is that in the mornings they make you do to-go’s. There’s no tips or extra money in packaging and handling to-go orders, and it’s extremely time consuming and takes away from your ability to make actual tips. The side work and responsibilities at the end of the night are exhausting and are maintenance/cleaning jobs, not serving job responsibilities
None that I could think of
Inconsistent traffic so tips can be inconsistent
I honestly don't have any bad experience here. One of my favorite serving jobs I've had.
Very busy sometimes and very slow other times
Nobody stays long, so force to work multiple different jobs always out of different types of food so customers get angry at you when it's not your fault
not consistent, need to work 2 jobs if this is your main cash flow, customers will be customer, management makes the job.
The hours are long so wear comfortable shoes
Coworkers have the undesirable spice.
Can be slow some times so not a lot of tips Closes late
Servers made more than the manager
Corporate had guidelines wanted to say to each table and makes experience less personable to guests in my opinion. You sound like a robot. They try to keep you only at three tables at a time.
It can get real busy at times and you can't help every waitress
Nights vary on how much you make
Hard work but worth it.
Working every single holiday. Heard Christmas is now a holiday they work
Everything from management to customers
Communication People skills Leadership Upper management Unrealistic goals
You are pretty much left to your own devices with little support.
No cons for this position.
Nothing really just busy all the time

Hours, more difficult guests since covid
management can be iffy sometimes and the days it’s slow stink
It can get real busy at times and you can't help every waitress
Pay is not that great for the work you have to put in.
unfortunately there was favoritism at work
People can be rude and inconsiderate of others
Depending on the shift it may be a lot slower
There wasn’t any when i worked there
Over the years they have gone too many changes. Menu prices are outrageous and have placed too many demands on the FOH staff. Servers aren’t well equipped to provide great customer service. For the price customers are paying.
Sometimes we get slow in the summer but other than that it’s pretty steady.
Hated the long hours but got used to it
Can have a lot of side work and off scope tasks
Company needs to reassess priorities if they want to succeed

Great Benefits, Great Life balance, Great Products
The corporate culture is relatively casual and warm. I've worked at more cut-throat corporate Ad Sales jobs and this is way, way better. The work-life balance is pretty great. Summer Fridays are really a thing here so there is not much activity and you can really have extra time to yourself. Fridays in general are a bit lighter as well. Paramount has deep pockets for employee talent when they choose. The payment package is strong. Most people are very leaned into their roles and do become subject matter experts. There are smart people in the Sales, Yield and Operations organizations. The company is stable and has strong fundamentals.

Many benefits and perks for staff members - people need to seek them out and take advantage of them. A media company working hard to be a leading entertainment provider in a difficult business. Post-Covid, they have embraced the hybrid work model and most departments adhere to that. Yearly raises are fair. Staff employees get bonuses based on level and company performance. Some years are better than others but have always gotten one since becoming eligible.

","Work direction and goals can be a little cloudy. Combination of systems accrued through multiple mergers have left back office processes and systems a little clunky
The Bus waits for no person. Stay Busy.
Their new policy apparently bars anyone below VP status from obtaining RSUs in their comp package. The offices are terrible. They are in the heart of Times Sq. which is a nightmare in and of itself. Additionally, the floor plan is not modern, stimulating and inviting. Instead, it is set up like legacy offices from the 80s - tan carpet, closed-door offices, poor lighting, limited conference rooms and phone booths, etc. There are also no kitchens on most floors. They do not even offer employees free snacks or drinks. Extremely frustrating. There is a culture of executive aloofness that is aggravating and counter-productive. You can almost guarantee yourself that anyone in a very senior executive role, across any department, will be extremely hard to communicate or collaborate with in any manner. This is much more prevalent than it is in other broadcast/streaming companies
- Pretty big work load and scope of duties - Could go through some modernization to become more competitive - Annual raises aren't competitive
Was fully remote due to Covid, but processes and communications were very organized and seamless.
Pay is not great, office location isn't ideal
Nothing I can think of at the moment.
No work life balance and can be draining.
- My team is severely under-resourced, despite a constantly growing workload, meaning that VPs and Senior Directors are doing the day-to-day work of managers and coordinators. Some people work 80-100 hours per week. - Though my individual team is tiny, all the various departments that touch a project could amount to over 100 stakeholders on a single project. Knowing who’s who is a daunting task. - Few or no processes in place to make the work efficient or streamlined - Little-to-know value is placed on my specific discipline. Leadership has offered no clear vision for the team or my specific role.
None that I can think of

Complicated and many-leveled approval structure. Marketing demands are eclipsing creative instincts. Most employees are let go when they reach their 50s.
Not enough shifts to go around
Nothing much to say about
Lacking in structure when it comes to roles and responsibilities, as well as proper onboarding, tools and resources to set someone up for success. Also seems to be a lack of understanding by leadership when it comes to what sells and what doesn’t. Continuous focus on pushing certain products instead of focusing more on where the money is. Also lack of consistency on commissions and goals making it difficult to keep track and stay motivated. It’s either no news or hair on fire and no real way to track the numbers independently.

Don't have any at the moment
management doesn't really know what they're doing
They like to project ideals that they don't actually own up to. There is definitely two different tiers of employees and it gets really awkward because contract employees do not have the same rights as full-time employees. While pay seems fine as a number you need to keep in mind you're in places like Los Angeles or New York City, so a six figure salary still doesn't afford rent for a good place in the area. You'll have to commute if you want a decent place to live because the area is by the office are so expensive and they're not paying you enough to be able to afford it even though you might be making six figures. They do tons of diversity training to project diversity, but ultimately there's a considerable divide. Lots of trying to be an ally but no true actions.
Low pay and unclear where position will lead
No leadership or punitive leadership. Job performance matters less than knowing the right person who will advance your career.

- depending on your team/manager, limited opportunities for growth - underpaid (consistent w/ entertainment industry but not similar roles elsewhere) - 401k takes 2 years to vest
The company lacks diversity not just internally but through its programming and externally in consumer facing multicultural spaces/events.
Sometimes it is hard to communicate and you don’t get a life
It can get to be pretty bureaucratic Compensation is not the best
None really that I can think off
Challenging market conditions are impacting stock price
I cannot think of anything negative to say about Viacom
unhealthy and toxic environment. backstabbing
Terrible at promoting from within
Sometimes the overall direction is not clear
Sneaky, back stabbers. Pay not fair.
The assignment took a long time, had to create a campaign from scratch and present it with a deck.
Bureaucratic culture Job stagnation Not high paying
Very long hours during busy times
Large pay gaps if you're dorect report doesn't vouch for you
Limited networking within company to grow
- Low pay - Red tape; feedback seemingly lives in a vacuum and no insight into how decisions impacting strategy/approach are made - Legacy ""this is how it's always been done"" mentality and lack of innovation.
Employees treated interns poorly, mainly the entry level women
Bullying and being told that if you take any of your unlimited PTO, you will have a bad performance review or be fired. Sexual harassment. Agressive meetings.
After almost four years given to the company, I'm still not a full-time employee with essential benefits. I work in a contract-based style that always depends on specific projects; the same happens with opportunities for growth and promotions, which hardly materialize. Despite feeling appreciated by my team and supervisor and loving my job, it's a bit discouraging and disappointing.
just be prepared for the ups and downs (more often) of the media industry.
A con would be the pay
Many steps to complete tasks
No stock purchase option available
Feels like one has to be creative and carve their own way before any promotion is considered
Lower pay compared to similar companies
It was Viacom, then it was ViacomCBS, and then it was Paramount. Each one came with reorganizations, and each one came with lay offs.
- Wish there was more mingling of different departments
Hours, lack of resources, bugs
Unsteady atmosphere during continuous industry and company consolidation.
The cons are working in-person no work-from-home options.
Lower pay compared to other companies
unhealthy and toxic environment. backstabbing
internal mobility can be a longer process
Sneaky, back stabbers. Pay not fair.
I loved working at Paramount. The only con was that I was part of a company wide layoff. it happens.
too many clients given to one pod.
Bureaucratic culture Job stagnation Not high paying
Large pay gaps if you're dorect report doesn't vouch for you
Could pay slightly better I think

If you are in college, this is a great place to balance your work life with school life. They are very reasonable with scheduling conflicts if you are taking college courses. Fellow associates tend to be in the same age range, (at least in the position i found myself in) since most everyone were college students.

Nice people to work with
","not many cons...long hours at times
- No opportunity for promotion - Understaffed during year and possibly during holidays - Greedy corporate staff who makes retail department suffer with low staff to make more revenue for yearly report - lack of willingness to train people under to promote - Waste of time and not worth career choice - Requirement to push credit cards frequently and not rewarded adequately for selling them. - Hour cuts
unbelievable workload, very toxic work environment, horrible management, 0 flexibility/ wFH, 0 growth
You pretty much stand in one spot all day, while the people who “train” you are likely just gossiping. Don’t worry they’ll save the jobs no one wants to do for you as well.
No room to grow Unhelpful HR staffe
Tend to do more jobs than originally expected
Team lead on the other hand, took themselves far too seriously. I remember having to stay so late one night because the jeans which were folded correctly but maybe not absolutely perfect was pulled down an entirety and we were all forced to refill all the jeans because of the team lead power tripping. She probably was a perfectly nice lady outside of work but considering that I think she maybe had a high school diploma only she was a career academy lead and really loved to flex her power because I think it was the only place that she got to feel like she was important. Also during holidays that place is absolute pandemonium so get your Epsom salt foot soak ready because you're going to be exhausted since you barely get a 15 minute break which by the time you clock out and back in is about a 7 minute break if you're lucky.
-Short staffed, overworked instead of hiring more people. -Over emphasis on selling credit cards
Wish they would pay better.
Very busy during holiday season
Hours get cut frequently and there is nothing you can do about it
Poor management and not guaranteed 40 hours as a full time employee hourly
Credit Card are highly influenced Managers tend to pick and choose favorites No PTO for part time employees You get points docked even if you have valid documentation of sickness
There was a lot of employee turnover.
Chaotic work environment Poor Inventory management Leadership was worried about the wrong things. (things that would get him a bonus) Switching out Assistant Managers alot
Management looks down on you and it’s not a very inclusive environment
The higher ups don’t care about the employees
Worked full time hours in a part time position
Bi weekly pay, petty store director, apparel management constantly quitting because of store director
Very stressful work environment at certain points due to high influx of customers
Sometimes they cut the hours
Awful don’t work here Racist
-Low Pay -Trucks are not packed safely
drama in the workplace usually
Extended hours during holidays inhibits family time even more.
Need to be flexible with time
Not many growth opportunities and often unable to use paid time off accrued
For the workload, pay is not great and processes need totally revamp and re-structure of tasks/duties to their rightful department. High volume workload everyday.
Management has horrible attitudes with lower employees.
U don't get a break at all. Only a lunch that you have to clock out for. No incentive for credit cards. They change your schedule without calling. And favor some more then others.. the bathroom is the nastiest... all they worry about is numbers.. customer service is unacceptable. And they judge off appearance and accuse people of stealing when they aren't.
The higher ups don’t care about the employees

For the workload, pay is not great and processes need totally revamp and re-structure of tasks/duties to their rightful department. High volume workload everyday.
Cut hours and end up working with less people so you have to do more work Upset if you don’t reach credit goal Work harder than others but receive same pay
Sometimes understaffed in between seasons
Too much pressure for credit
Tend to cut employee hours based on sales
Eveything it is very unorganized
Managers aren't considerate or understanding
The work is typical physical labor
You’ll be used everywhere, in every department. Management often differs, but it’s always what comes down from corporate. Employee ideas are not given a chance to flourish or even critiqued into something more beneficial.
Poor management. I was fired within 2 months for issues that I was not properly trained on. I literally did not screw up on anything where money was missing or customers were affected. The computer system always showed registers over or short when you first go to work and management is never held responsible BUT if you are over or short $5, you are 1 more screw up from being fired. That and they don’t train you properly. Once and that’s it. It’s a lot of pressure for a new employee.
Hours get cut like crazy when sales are low
Wages could be more competitive for the area.
Very busy if you don’t like to work don’t apply.
Managers don't know how to do there jobs properly, its so bad they can't even manage their teams well. They like to hire people and does not have proper training. The company lacks inclusion and equality.
Lack of continuous associates in the workplace.
boring work that gets very repetative
None that I can think of.
Poor Pay Lacking Hours Hardly any raises or promotions Forces you to be part-time even if you applied for full-time. Very cruel and rude customers. Management is patronizing and demeaning most times (there are a few rare ones who are respectful). They want full availability but still don't give hours. Tasks are easy BUT there are a lot of them. Expect to be driven like a slave. Understaffed so you have to work 10X harder. Also, if you get full-time hours, don't expect to be registered as full-time or receive any full-time benefits.
boring when not busy you are stuck behind the firearms counter
Not much flexibility with schedules
Tend to cut employee hours based on sales
I am not in charge of my schedule and I would like to use my skills to earn money.
If customer service or working with the public isnt something you enjoy, then this definitely isnt the job for you. People can often times be irritated and really make working there daily hard to manage and find motivation. Also, things are constantly changing so its best not to try and find any patterns for daily routines.

Medical insurance not that great Small company problem of micro management, but improving Heavily dependent on contractors
Senior leadership within the store can be a bit toxic and demanding. Lack of communication among them. Hourly pay needs to be addressed and adjusted to be more competitive with new businesses moving into the area. Senior leadership can get a bit disgruntled if you wont stay past your scheduled shift or wont come in on your day off to work.
Wages could be more competitive for the area.
Management was inconsistent with directions for daily task and expectations
Very busy if you don’t like to work don’t apply.
Literally everything else. Managers disrespect the workers underneath them. No work/life balance. Expected to come in if coverage is needed otherwise they display disappointment. Definitely promote based on their personal connections. I watched multiple people who were newer and closer to the managers get promotions and I had to train them for a position higher than mine!
Low staffing causes team members to be stretched thin
Nothing really too bad to say
Lack of continuous associates in the workplace.
boring work that gets very repetative
Was overworked to just under full-time hours for the summer, once the back to school rush was over, cut all of our hours. Seemed like I hadn’t seen a sunset for weeks.
None that I can think of.
No incentive to achieve more
Puts stress on home/work balance
Took a long time to get a response. You have to keep calling. Long hours and heavy labor. It is exhausting. If there is no work, you get sent home early and you lose money. It can be unpredictable.
The store manager, some of the customer base, hours, forcing the credit card on people
On your feet all day
- Lack of Training Structure - The role is very dependable on the systems, tools, and resources to do the role effectively, in this case it’s a stress because the company needs to have better improvements with efficiencies and the process is very slow compared to other tools that competitors use in the market for their ecommerce platforms. -There’s is a lack of alignment on processes with cross-functional partners and the way the company operates. This creates stress levels for someone getting 50+ emails a day on stuff that’s broken out of your control. -The culture is a little dry. The company hardly ever promotes mental health, LGBTQ principles, ERG Groups, and Training Workshops. It’s seems to have a very conservative culture. Many companies provide a hybrid or remote option to work, but Academy is strictly on-site with the exception of working remote only on Black Friday and throughout the Holidays. The CEO believes working in-person creates long-lasting relationships, but ignores the fact that people need flexibility to take care of their personal matters when they need to. The company is slowly improving, as we now can work a half-day on Fridays.
I have no cons to share
sucky hours for holidays and weekends
The cons are that the work environment is very busy you will have some obnoxious customers at time and it can be very busy
End of shift down time makes the day slow
If customer service or working with the public isnt something you enjoy, then this definitely isnt the job for you. People can often times be irritated and really make working there daily hard to manage and find motivation. Also, things are constantly changing so its best not to try and find any patterns for daily routines.
Customers can be very rude
Not really engaging. Same things every day.
Sometimes it can be overbearing
Poor management training. Aged technology. Pay is not that competitive
The work life balance could be improved.

There was too much drama between leads, managers, and regular employees. As soon as the store opened and their sales dropped, they cut everyone's hours significantly without notice. The cashier position was very stressful and demanding.
Under paid and no work from home

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/HubSpot-Reviews-E227605.htm,"The work life balance was incredible
It's a great company with great benefits. Truly, I loved the culture and felt that they cared about their employees (very different from previous employers). There are plenty of one-off benefits that actually made me feel valued. When I exceeded quota, my manager sent me a nice bottle of champagne which really made me feel valued. Compensation is fair for the role and commission structure is very clear. No concerns about being cheated out of what you earned. Ramp is a full year, so it gives you time to learn the product and get comfortable with the role. Truthfully, it's an enjoyable and welcoming place to work. THe people are the best and I made real friends there despite the WFH environment.
Leadership is very transparent and humble, often recognizing areas they need to improve and actually taking steps to improve them. They are not afraid to admit where they've gotten something wrong. There are some excellent new leaders that we have brought in product that have great expertise, maturity, and empathy. I'm excited to see what they can do. Great PTO. HS also does a great job of supporting big life moments, good and bad. I really appreciate the human touch and empathy the company takes here. Lots of cons, but some of these are pervasive in tech and not unique to HS sadly.
A supportive environment, they truly promote work-life balance, ability to work remotely is a plus and they are making a solid effort to be a company that truly values diversity and inclusion.
I've had more opportunities to stretch myself at this company than any role I've had over my career. I'm held to high standards, but they are also making me successful. I've had the opportunity to work on global projects that help every recruiter do their jobs better, which I'm incredibly proud of. I also have the opportunity to work with the best teams in the business, second to none. I have amazing work life balance and never feel the need to be working crazy hours. Working from home helps me to have balance.
- Awesome company on your resume - Arguably the best product in its space - Great tech to help you do your job - Great at diversity and inclusion - Great 12 month ramp for new hires
Pay, culture, benefits and time off (PTO, global week of rest), create your own schedule/ autonomy
Customer focused company with interesting problems to solve
- the tech stack is interesting and with the smaller teams, one can learn interesting things
Ability to work fully remote Compensation is pretty good Sabbatical after five years
World-class product - the product really is the best on the market. Flexibility in building custom packages for customers with products and pricing. Customers know and love the product and often bring it from company to company with them. In general, I have a ton of hope for HubSpot and there are some really amazing people there however there is a lot to improve on. I'm writing this review bc I wish I had seen one like it before I joined. If you are coming from a Salesforce, are super organized, and land on the right team with a good territory you will be great!!
- flexibility to work wherever - great healthcare and leave benefits - 5 year sabbatical - great managers - decent compensation - stock awards are nice
Commission - the only reason people are here is for the money. It's the epitome of the Golden Handcuffs.
Work Life Balance is felt. HubSpot recognizes the importance of this. Autonomy and Empowerment.
- Platform: it really is amazing. It is just as powerful as its two main competitors, but it is so much easier to use. It demos very well and people know who we are. - Innovation: They are making changes and improving the platform. - People: I keep waiting for people to be rude or not helpful. Just not going to happen. The culture is solid.
Remote status forever, no set hours, flexible time off.
Unlimited PTO and decent 401k benefits, decent employee stock purchase plan
You get a middling job that will pay the bills and work remotely that will give you an excuse to hide from disrespectful or moderately competent coworkers. You get to work against other teams and compete to be better than all the rest, the best like no one ever was. You might get to work with a leader that doesn't assign you the same task also assigned to several others, unbeknownst to you. You can take unlimited vacation and fall behind your co-workers on their way to a promotion before you, even though you completed everything in good order. You get a high chance of taking on work that will not get recognized because the leader that designed the project was confused and can't understand if there's any business value. You might still have some of the benefits advertised by the time you start. You might have a chance to switch teams or move internally if leadership thinks a new shiny title and rebranding an existing role are important in the next year.
Decent salary for the postion compared to other job offers on the market, good health insurance
Great direct management Great team

Great people work here. The company hires for HEART and you can feel that among the teams.

I've been here for 4 years, there's no where else I could see myself at this point.
A fantastic culture, incredible people, and leadership that is keenly in-tune with the market, and our customers.
- Great environment to learn a ton about inbound and various business operation strategies. - Great environment very supportive and they make an effort to be diverse and open, culturally. - They hire good people. - you can really lean into subject matter experts and utilize resources as much as you need.
- transparency - people - work/life balance - impactful work
HubSpot is a very competitive place to get in the door and with that the company expects a high level of execution. In return, you get an employer that is transparent, fair, and supportive with clear promotion paths and tons of opportunities to learn and grow.
Great work/life balance, people, benefits
Great culture and great teammates

Leadership (Kate Bueker & Yamini in particular are remarkable
Great balance of challenging problems and giving you space when you need it.
- forward thinking product team - transparent and caring leadership - great sales culture
Great company name to have on your resume, good benefits, WFH flexibility
The people and the culture, especially from a hybrid perspective is all you can ask for from a corporate company.
Product fit, product need. Always growing under your feet. Despite less inbound than what I’ve heard of previously, plenty of really warm engagements due to how robust the CRM is and the resources and content they create for engagement
- Very good benefits such as Unlimited PTO, flexible working option: WFH, hybrid, office. - Generous technology equipment provided - Great product as a streamlined solution - Strong software brand
Learned a lot of information regarding use and management of CRM’s. Team culture was great and there are lot of people that inspire you to be great and do your best.
Great colleagues and culture, lasting relationships
As long as things are running well, this is a great company to work for. It appears they care for their employees. But the culture might not be consistent in all the teams. Some teams work closely and collaborate whereas some make you feel more isolated. The expectation in some teams is that you solve problems independently.
Great people, growth ops, support
great colleagues, that makes up the entirety of the culture.
","There were no cons of working here.
A lottttt of meetings. I spent almost 2 hours a day in internal meetings. Truly a waste of time and annoying. Management also needs some work. The sales managers take way too much time off and don't really take the time to support their team. My manager, specifically, was out for a total of 3 months throughout the one year I was there. It was truly shocking. Unrealistic expectations. You'll be hired for an inbound sales role, then will never receive a single lead (FYI I'm fine selling OB, but to be hired for one role and receive a salary for that role then not receive the tools for it seems wild.)
- HubSpot is like a high school clique where those that are ""insiders"" are protected and promoted often at the expense of more skilled, smarter, mature, and more empathetic leaders. If you don't ""fit in"" to the HS way, you won't go anywhere and the ""HS way"", at least in product, often favors the men that have been here a long time and are now at the top. See the other brave reviewers here that have spoken out about how HS treats people with differing opinions, styles, etc. - We also vastly undervalue design and this seems to be getting worse by the day. We hire such talented designers and then don't give them the room or voice to lend their expertise. - Over the past year, the amount of autonomy of teams has dissipated. While this is to be expected as a company scales, some parts of this org now have highly paid, smart, and skilled IC's and middle managers who are basically just executing on the orders from people at the very top (again beware if you voice a different opinion).
I engaged with several managers that lacked management experience and had trouble with management skills that are absolutely necessary for employee success such as; setting expectations, giving feedback in a timely manner, listening to understand and delivering performance reviews. They are still working out developing processes and guidelines that help with consistency and making sure that all departments are treated fairly. Departments such as sales, information technology and customer service don't always get to enjoy benefits such as unlimited PTO or attending culture seminars, etc. Upper management behaved differently when interacting with employees one on one or in small groups vs. how they behave in company meetings. It was a disappointing experience to meet with men AND women in upper management and learn that they weren't as authentic and kind as they appeared to be when addressing a large group. HubSpot still has a long way to go to become the company they want to be. I hope they are willing to do the work it takes to get there.
There are some inequities across functions (some recruiters don't have KPI's, others do) that I'd love to see level out across the org.
- Mid Market leadership and rep turnover is pretty high. - Micromanagement is notoriously high nowadays - Quota attainment is pretty questionable as nearly half the sellers are ramping - Territories sliced and diced every year meaning your territory is the biggest factor in your success and happiness or your failure - Quotas set don’t make sense any longer given prior weightings for quota have all but flown out rhe window
Started out leading calls with VPs 6 weeks in while knowing next to nothing about the intricacies of the product (the training to this point was largely emotion based). The customers knowledge of the product ranges from next to nothing (if they weren't using it, big red flag, hah) to having a mastered it. The types of questions that consistently come up on calls and via email lead to me sifting through many, many Slack channels in desperate attempt for answers. I receive lots of support from my manager and peers, but often the questions are so complex that I'll receive 10 Wiki resources and/ or get on a call with a coworker that ends up being an hour long. Great company, but be prepared for this.
The so called HEART is mosty talk. Not consistent. Humble and Empahty is only when you are in the circle of the leadership. Or, if you are within product org, you are treated well, if you are not part of product team and trying to collaborate with them, you are excluded. Also, there's no empowerment of decisions. Leadership review 100 pages of slides for each review meeting and tons of data and almost every business decisions need C level review and approval. There's no structure and process. Leaders talk about automation as priority but the problem starts with accountability and process. When those are not clear, every department is trying to fight their way to prove their value by stepping into other function or people's area. No work life balance. People at senior leadership level openly say there's only work life flexibility.
I’ve worked at the company as both an intern for multiple periods (2018, 2019) and as a full timer from 2020-2023 and I can attest to the very negative turn in culture at this company. I raised concerns about my manager which were ignored by upper leadership and it resulted in multiple retaliations, an internal whistleblower investigation, and ultimately short after the investigation’s conclusion, was let go ( although they made it a point to let me know they do not retaliate against employees who file whistleblower complaints) - if you are neurodivergent, not able-bodied, a person of color, a woman, etc my strong recommendation would be to avoid this company like the plague. If you do not conform, you will be sidelined and most likely let go eventually. I know of a few former employees that have really bad interactions with this company behind close door. Please be careful and consider other options
In the past year or so the culture at HubSpot has taken a complete nosedive. There has been a total exodus of highly tenured, knowledgeable people across so many departments who had been with the company for many years and held so much knowledge. It seems most everyone you now meet has been here under 2 years, which should tell you something. Leadership keeps joining from major Fortune 500 companies and along with it they have brought the toxic cultures. They continue “benchmarking to the market” which basically means doing away with the benefits and culture that made HubSpot special and different from the typical corporation that treated you as just a number. Work-life balance was terrible to begin with and was made worse after the layoffs. Constant communications via emails and Slack at all hours of the day and everything is somehow an emergency that needed to be completed yesterday. People are already on the edge of burnout, yet somehow we’re now pushing this new “high performance culture” that HR and leadership have barely been able to articule and explain what exactly it means.
You are very unlikely to make it out of your first year of Ramp Of my hiring class almost 50% were put on a pip and/or fired The managers have an actual incentive to continue to bring on new reps while pipping/firing under 1 year reps to keep their team number low, while they send good leads to tenured reps They provide very little training - managers do not have a ton of product knowledge and there is no formal training program Lots of noise and unfocused strategy - Strategy seems last minute and ad hoc. CRM DATA IS A MESS ---- This was a major shock for me because it adds an insane amount of admin work on your plate, think old contacts, duplicate records, and records that don't connect to our actual customer database. They ask you to hit prospecting metrics with extremely few tools and a messy crm which makes it super frustrating. Territories are unfair - Reps who have been there for 2+ years know every trick in the book and have bloated books of businesses by skirting around rules. Managers pass leads to tenured reps Leadership protects managers who churn through new reps, they say it's a mishirebut its really just bad or poorly trained managers Straddling the fence between a true enterprise org and a smb/mid-market org - they expect you to be running small transactional deals while executing complex deals with 10+ team member deal teams. This is nearly impossible with the amount of time in the day, messy crm data, metric expectations (ie calls, emails, activities and tasks), and internal meetings (there are a ton) VP of sales says we are on quarterly quota when you are actually on monthly quota. The sales cycle length is quarterly. You can hit your yearly, and quarterly numbers and be fired on missing a month. Very little team culture - There are some amazing tenured reps that are willing to help but there are few and far in-between. Most reps are just trying to get by and have their heads down and are unwilling to help.
- Exec leaders are a bit complacent with workplace culture and expect way more of people, but aren’t offering perks or even INBOUND travel to retain and fulfill talent like they used to. - 401k match and bonus structures aren’t that good. - Execs are stuck in their ways and make calls without talking to stakeholders most impacted.
Little time to sell because of back-to-back internal meetings every day. Having a family AND being successful here is not possible. You must let one of these options go because in order to meet quota, you will need to work 12 hours per day. Poor health benefits. Poor morale - is anyone happy here anymore? Working with so many people who hate their job is toxic and feels awful. Monthly quotas rather than quarterly.
One of the most concerning aspects is the prevailing culture that demands conformity. If you do not conform to the established norms and hesitate to challenge existing ideas, you are quickly labeled as a troublemaker or disruptive. Instead of fostering a learning environment where new ideas are welcomed, they tend to isolate individuals who don't conform, making it difficult for them to thrive. HubSpot's resistance to diversity and differing perspectives creates an echo chamber where innovative thinking is stifled. It is disheartening to witness the missed opportunities for growth and improvement that could arise from embracing a more inclusive culture. Moreover, the consequences of not toeing the line are severe. Those who dare to challenge anything often find themselves on the bad side of management, facing subtle retaliation and sometimes even attempts to push them out of the company. This behavior only further perpetuates a culture of fear and inhibits personal and professional growth.
- The Corporate Division is a combo of mid market and small enterprises. Just know that. We are not going into the enterprise market anytime soon (as a company effort). There is a lot of greenspace still to grab in the 200-2000 market. Just make sure you understand that and you will be closing a lot of small deals. If that is what you want to do, then this is the place. - Despite what leadership says, it is a lottery in terms of getting good or big leads. Now, you can do a lot with your BDR and increase your luck for sure, but the big deals come down to pure luck. I will say you still need good sales folks to close them. Getting the big lead is where the luck stops. - Terriroties are crazy. It is a team territory, and you get 50-70 top companies, and then you build your territory from there. It is nuts. There is so much to learn when you get her, and you have to worry about making sure you have the correct type of companies in your territory. - Everything that folks are saying about the division is mostly true. In the Corporate Division, you will be put in a special club (they actually call it a club) if you make below 70% in any given single month. If you blow out your quarter in the first month, then are below 70% the next month, you go on it. This is very much a micromanaging company. - 90% of the front line mangers are just there to report and move people out. It is actually bad for a manager to have a team of tenured reps as they will have full numbers. If you can sell, you will blow out your ramp number (which is VERY generous at 10+ months). We have a leadership issues. The second line are not much better as they were just promoted up with a small business mentality. - Onboarding is a joke. If you cannot or not willing to learn how to demo on your own, don't come here. Managers do nothing to help. Now, if you are good, and willing to work, being able to demo the product is a HUGE weapon. You will have to be self taught. - C level leadership is trying to make a one size fits all for each division for processes. Makes zero sense but I see why they are doing it. - You can make a great living here and sell an amazing platform, but just be aware of what you are getting into.
The pay here sucks. They changed our roles to include calling customers and added a bunch of responsibilities but refuse to pay more. They laid off a bunch of people recently and now there is even more work for everyone. The bar they set for goals is often out of reach and unreasonable considering how many HubSpot customers are canceling their subscriptions. You have the luck of the draw every month to see how many accounts you'll get with cancelations. But you're now also expected to up sell or cross sell. I'm not a sales rep! The worst part is our job is to tell people they can't cancel and be cold hearted to those in dire financial situations. HubSpot no longer cares for the employees or customers. They only care about revenue and forcing people into contracts that they can't get out of.
Advancement opportunities for support feel almost non-existent, a lot of people join support as a way to get into the company and then find out it is nearly impossible to move up from there. The ones that do have to fight tooth, nail, and claw and are essentially treated like they are being tossed a bone. If you interview and don't make it they make you wait months before you can apply again. being a high performer doesn't matter as Support people can get globally recognized and still not be good enough to get promoted. On top of all of that, in January HubSpot laid off 500 employees, or 7% of its workforce and it was supposed to be 'spread evenly across departments"" but the Support team lost 40% of it's staff, and the work volume has been oppressive ever since. Another result of this is that previously, support reps had a rotating weekend shift every 6 months, or twice a year. They are now scheduling 4 per year, and made no announcement of the change and are shushing anyone who remarks that this is a result of the layoff. It is just one more way that they are making the job crappier for the support team and doing nothing to support them. The amount of knowledge and aptitude you need for support also means this role is severely underpaid. Of course they are always 'talking about adjusting pay' but nothing ever happens.
This is a complete bureaucracy now. Any merit based teams are few and far between. Those teams are also probably not hiring, as they are being forced to conform or actively being managed out by being given unrealistic expectations. Culture, teamwork, and comradery are all rapidly declining as teams feel pit against each to produce.
Since Hubspot understaffed support via the 7% workforce reduction earlier this year , and this short staffing has been further exacerbated by massive attrition since, Hubspot's culture has shifted dramatically. Leadership doesnt care about experience, seniority, or history of loyalty in employees. All that matters now is your production numbers this month. There is no context that can explain low numbers and no compassion for employees. I personally know a mentor-type person with years of experience who was cut loose in recent months after their numbers dropped due to stress caused by their move across the country, and the general burn-out culture we work in 40 hours a week. Everyone i know is leaving as quickly as possible. This ship is sinking while on fire
When I originally got hired we were told we had a choice of whether we want to be on phones and chats. Then they did a huge layoff and mandiated everyone to be on phones

- can get burnt out if you are not taking care of yourself - the pay is not sustainable if you live in a big city
Hard to find any really
Career growth can be limited, compensation is getting in line with top companies but not there yet
HubSpot has very rapidly declined in how they treat their employees and the lack of accountability in upper management. Right now most support reps are staying due to their unlimited holidays but if this was removed there would be a massive exodus. There is no incentives for hard work and the salaries are mediocre. There was also a feeling that it was impossible to get out of support through internal mobility . People with experience and Master degree being stuck in this team for years. Recently, more and more highly skilled employees are moving on to other companies after trying to get promoted over 8 or 9 times.
lack of culture virtually, lame-duck sales managers (this is all a roll of the dice who you end up with), and aggressive about letting people go instead of trying to help. Horrible clawbacks, with HubSpot policies they use these to their advantage to hemorrhage your commission checks so you never make your full OTE
None that I can think of
Not the best work environment
Hard to find any really
Terrible sales leadership Toxic sales culture Sales leaders do not uphold HubSpot’s company values Senior leaders only promote sales leaders based on numbers resulting in massive widespread culture issues Terrible at supporting sales people returning from parental leave. Lots of reps end up on plan or let go which is horrible
Career growth can be limited, compensation is getting in line with top companies but not there yet
They've made so many changes to the support org people are literally leaving in a mass exodus. Pay is absolute crap for the knowledge you hold, the situations you need to resolve, and the request to hit their metrics. Upper management has literally dropped the ball with the support org when so many people were pushing back against the changes they wanted to implement. Changes that were made by people who never held an actual customer support rep position in their lives. Guess what happened?! Metrics tanked, SLA's tanked, great workers left, they laid people off, then had the audacity to tell people to work harder, then a bunch more people left. When I left they were trying to do some stupid contests to give people a -chance- at earning more money. Essentially getting people to work harder with no guarantee of more pay. Don't drink the Kool aid.
The org needs a facelift
Could be better pay for this role
None that I can think of
The company has grown fast and when that happens it's hard to not experience growing pains.
- Large company and easy to get bogged down in processes and approvals - Salaries are less competitive than other large names in tech
With highly autonomous product teams, things sometimes feel siloed. The company is working to correct this.
This is across the board in software sales due to the recession it’s been a lot more difficult to hit quota and yet they keep raising the quota. Thsi is after laying off 500 employees this year. So that sucks.
-high performance expectations, metrics sometimes conflicting
just terrible micromanaging from the top down/
Company and even department meetings feel like a pep rally
wish they offered more bonuses, could be on lower end of salary range
Not the best work environment
- The pay is OK. I believe it could be higher compared to other customer success roles out there. General salary between 75-87k for the segment is considerably less than many companies offering at least 90-110k for the same role. Many people stay for the work-life balance, knowing they could make more elsewhere. However, as much as we wouldn't want it to be this way, money has to take precedent sometimes and that causes great employees to leave. - Target metrics right now (Revenue Retention) are unattainable for my segment. We receive promotion based on this metric, so it's a hard pill to swallow when you miss promotion not because you aren't putting in effort, but because companies are generally lowering software costs due to macroeconomic conditions completely out of your control.
Salary could be a little higher
Terrible sales leadership Toxic sales culture Sales leaders do not uphold HubSpot’s company values Senior leaders only promote sales leaders based on numbers resulting in massive widespread culture issues Terrible at supporting sales people returning from parental leave. Lots of reps end up on plan or let go which is horrible
-Sales leadership is terrible has no idea how to navigate this downturn -Tons of gaslighting and ""do more outreach"" messaging to hit goals -If you don't get an S tier capacity you can forget about any sustained success here -Sales leaders are even jumping ship
I worked at HubSpot for a year and in my experience, the Culture and HEART stuff is bs. I was one of many laid off and for a company that cares so much about transparency, they shifted from “No Layoffs, to Layoffs possible if things get bad, to… Sorry we are laying you off.” This was in a matter of 90 days and 30 days before that the company leaders were celebrating smashing the sales goals so this layoff was simply a stock bump. Look at the price of the stock change from Jan 31-Feb 5 2023. For a company that said in December, “Worst case scenario only we will lay off, and sent companywide emails about smashing their sales goals, it’s pretty crappy to read an email the last day of January telling me that I am laid off.
- Something about asking new hires to leave reviews irritates me. HubSpot has enough new hires to manipulate/skew Glassdoor. I'd recommend sorting out one-line five-star reviews. They are not genuine. - Leadership is atrocious. The worst that I've ever seen. See, there are two kinds of people at HubSpot in Sales. 1. Those with lots of RSUs understand the HubSpot game (Drink the Cool-Aid and know your place). 2. Folks who want to build their career at a great company are left out to dry. - Underpaid relative to unrealistic quota. They are not honest about quota attainment and failure is encouraged in many ways as it helps leaders exceed their goals. - Product only competes competitively in one area (Marketing) - Turnover is really bad. No one brings their authentic self to work as you will be judged and mistreated as a result. Believe me, you do not want to be the cranky wheel at HubSpot. - Worst AE support I've seen. No one at HubSpot will help you. Not your manager, not your SE (they don't do demos or much at all). You will succeed or fail and it's 100% on you. - No exit interview upon departure. - Fought company to get earned commissions. - Managers have off-sites, reps stay and work. Never met a HubSpot colleague in my 2+ years.
I have none at this time
Siloed teams that each follow very different processes
Product is expensive and can be hard to sell
Burn-out culture! If you care about having a personal life and your mental health, please avoid at all cost. The micromanagement is like anything I’ve seen before and is mentally exhausting. Strong emphasis on KPIs regardless of if you’re hitting your quota or not. My entire team is absolutely terrified to miss quota and the pressure is insane. Don’t even think about taking time off if you’re in sales. They have a yearly “recharge” week in July (really they just give you an extra couple of days in July to make it 1 week) and that is the only time off you’re expected to take. The HEART culture is a myth and I have experienced 0 Empathy so far at HubSpot. Good luck to anyone thinking of joining!
HubSpot has grow rapidly in the past two years and, with the pandemic, has lost some of the closeness it once had among teams and colleagues. It’s also increasingly difficult to make things happen with so many layers of process and stakeholders
The other reviewer and former employee with the title ""this is a corporation, not your friend or family"" was 100% spot on. The company and its executives were shouting from the rooftops about crushing their sales goals and saying that layoffs were highly unlikely (only a measure that would be taken in a worst case scenario). Well, less than two months later they announced layoffs out of nowhere! There was not a single indicator that this would happen. In fact, emails were being circulated days before about how they were ""crushing it""... HubSpot does not deserve the accolades about how great a place it is to work at or how amazing their values are. Yes, your small corner of the company on your team of a dozen people may have some upsides, but outside of that it's no different than any other massive corporation. Current employees, post layoff, are having more asked of them and being treated like machines. Unlimited PTO is a trap and their sick policy is a joke. Oh, and HubSpot uses it's ""great culture"" as a means to justify paying lower than industry average across the board and giving mid tier benefits. Don't be fooled by the smoke and mirrors.
Hubspot has lost its culture since the layoffs. No room for growth, and they dont really appreciate those on the front lines
Lots of red tape Lots to learn
With highly autonomous product teams, things sometimes feel siloed. The company is working to correct this.
competition obsessed I think every other slide in onboarding was just about Salesforce (doesnt seem healthy), onbaording is like going back to university hours of zoom and tests and homework, tech stack is over complicated, pay for BDR not competative, tuition benefit only for going back to school not Student Loan payments, health care have to pay for
This is across the board in software sales due to the recession it’s been a lot more difficult to hit quota and yet they keep raising the quota. Thsi is after laying off 500 employees this year. So that sucks.

Hubspot is growing and making decisions that seem rash and perhaps not executed to the best of their ability. Growth conversations and leadership is extremely varied among teams. Some teams have incredible leadership and systems and others have high turn over and inconsistent streams of information.
Salary could be a little higher
A popular saying has always been employees leave bad managers and not good companies. I left extreme micromanagement. HubSpot sales became so toxic anxiety overall monthly quota attainment would wake me up at night and morning - leaving me with rarely any good nights of sleep. Being constantly harassed on Slack for every single deal. Needing to know my wearability constantly. Not being treated with empathy from direct management about the market vs the messaging relayed about uncertain economies in executive AMAs. I left because of extremely bad management all around. This is from the top down. Leadership starting from the c-suite to direct sales management that has declined so quickly. Company trust is completely lacking. The CEO and board of directors really screwed up and lied to all of HubSpot about layoffs. Telling the organization that we were doing “OK” as a company. I wasn’t laid off but I wish I had the option to be. This way I wouldn’t have killed myself overworking for a company who doesn’t care about its employees. Always checking my email for any qualified leads that would seldom come in and out of fear that it would rotated to another sales rep if I dare to truly take time off. Never taking a true vacation except the Global Week of Rest. Unlimited PTO is a fallacy for salespeople here on a monthly quota. I hated working here since the economy took a nose dive and SaaS in general plateaued. I truly wish I had the option to be laid off. But it’s no wonder salespeople here are last to be laid off because they can let you go at any time and give you very little severance compared to those who were actually laid off. You are a number at HubSpot. I wasn’t cared for by a single HR or management person. Believe me I’ve tried to voice my concerns every chance I got. Did I need to speak to Dharmesh or someone else? Instead of anyone being there to listen besides those on the selling frontline with me, I was constantly rebuffed. Ignored by Katie Burke who wrote a very perfectly curated response indicating her concern to my feedback of HubSpot becoming toxic, but then deflecting me to her assistant. Trying to talk to HR, but they only act as an “advisory role” and refused to hear any feedback - telling me to go to my direct manager and director. Everything fell on deaf ears. Thanks a lot guys. I devoted night and day to this company and management was just terrible all around. Here, you are just your numbers, not humanized. Empathy as a core value? I have yet to see it in the management level anywhere. Beware and please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere unless you want to play Russian roulette for who you get for a director and manager. Oh, and being paid under the average salary for your job when you have to prospect, run discovery calls, demo, and negotiate all by yourself. Many of my friends have felt absolute pity for me and appreciate their own managers and organizations all the more after seeing how I was micromanaged and treated. They’ve worked for much more, took their vacations while I sacrificed time with my family and lowered quality of my life. HubSpot is like that cute girl that you really want to date, but you end up taking her swimming and all her glamorous makeup comes off. Only then do you realize she looks nothing like she does with her makeup, were completely catfished/deceived, yet stuck with her because in the world of tech layoffs and overall crap economy for tech sales, you are stuck for lack of better options. I’m leaving the first chance I get with an alternate offer elsewhere. I am and was stuck out of lack of options because many companies froze hiring. Being stuck is not a good reason to stay. HubSpot, you know sales morale is down. You are becoming a corporation that bleeds talent. You are not reflecting the core values you tote about anymore. Especially in empathy and transparency. Do better.
No bonuses for individual contributors, lower than standard pay, lack of clarity as to the true state of the company and boasting about “working for the customer” simply means they are in it for the revenue and do not care about their employees. This has been shown with their recent layoffs after celebrating how well we did closing out 2022, leaving the current workforce to handle double, if not triple the load.
- The TL position is super overwhelming. I honestly think this is due to very weak product leadership. We are left doing product worker along with engineering work, burning us out. - Product doesn't seem capable at doing product things, like deciding on the product's vision. Clearly this isn't everywhere in the company, but it is where I am at. - Too many leaders without good experience, other than at HubSpot. - Not really a con, but lots of young workers here who have a false reality of what real-work is or that businesses need to make decisions that are best for the business not employees. - The woke stuff is a bit ridiculous here, but at least its isolated in most spaces. - 401k match is kinda trash
Just your average growing pains of a mid-size company becoming enterprise.
Sheer size of the organization can make communication challenging, and opportunities for growth or mobility could be more clear.
Implementation specialists are under paid and overworked. The portfolio of clients managed is way to many to manage successfully and to have meaningful, helpful interactions with clients. - this is a result of their rapid growth, and the success during covid, but it's led to poor retention in the Implementation team / department. - the process for promotion or salary increase is filled with redundant tasks that someone managing a portfolio of 50 clients does not have time to do. It requires having to use specific examples of times when you've exercised core competencies associated with the role. And while this is a good lesson and good preparation for conversations that you are likely to have down the road, there are simpler, better ways to teach this lesson, in my opinion.
- systems and tools don't meet our scale - compensation isn't consistent across
Monthly quotas mean a deadline is always looming
Hubspot has lost its culture since the layoffs. No room for growth, and they dont really appreciate those on the front lines
Not that i Can think of Pay May not be the topbtier though
- Can be very unstructured - Not all roles seem very desirable
- Slow moving at times
no cons yet for me in the role

If you want an in-person office experience, HubSpot is likely not for you. Full Hybrid on paper, but most folks are remote
None that I can think of right now. Comp has come a long way and is competitive with FAANG
- tough selling environment in SaaS right now. HubSpot is not immune to this.
I'm not sure how HubSpot is ranked so high on best places to work, the culture (at least on the corporate sales side) is hands down, the worst I have ever seen. Unfortunately, a lot of the success at HubSpot comes down to 1. your territory and 2. your manager. If either, or both of those are lacking, you're in trouble. Product has potential in the enterprise space, but there is a long way to go. Management measures ""enterprise"" (which are really mid market) reps on a monthly quota which in ""enterprise"" sales, is unrealistic. Leadership also recently rolled out what's called ""breakfast club"" for reps that are below 70% of their monthly number. Basically, that entails sending an email every Friday to your manager, director, and VP explaining why you missed your number, what you are doing to improve for next month, and laying out all of your KPIs and metrics. This means you can hit 400% of your number one month, then 68% of your number the next month, and you will still be put in breakfast club. Love being micro-managed? HubSpot's your place. There is close to no onboarding when you start, and you are expected to be a pro in all of HubSpot's ""hubs"" meaning Sales, Marketing, Service, Operations, and CMS. In regards to parental leave- YES, you have 16 weeks which is wonderful HOWEVER- be prepared to ramp back up within weeks or you will be put on PIP. HubSpot does a great job hyping up the 16 week leave but what they don't mention is the ramp period when you get back. Beware. HubSpot also takes Woke Culture to the next level and if you're not bought in, you're an outcast. All in all, I would strongly, strongly suggest looking elsewhere.
I have no cons to provide for HubSpot.
I feel a little siloed inside my immediate team. Met all targets but unsure how my skill ranks across the sales org
The Sales organization has turned toxic and is also a matter of luck and territory distribution. The person of color experience has not been very a positive one. A team member and I are notably persons of color and have not been treated as valuable persons. Also, highly misleading with effectiveness of the marketing team and ""inbound marketing"" - the sales team is hunting and doing almost purely outbound sales which is a miserable experience! Some people also abuse the unlimited PTO and there is a really stingy budget for team get togethers. Seeing the other reviews, HubSpot has built a culture of churn and burn through their own reps, where reps will stay 1-2 years at below market pay for AEs and then go somewhere else with a 30-50k pay bump for less work!
Only con was that I was laid off. Understandable with the shift in revenue goals
Work load and priorities - team members understood how difficult things were, but management never gave it more than lip service
Someone might be extremely skilled, knowledgeable and might be your mentor, as a result their inexperience doesn't help in effective knowledge transfer Similarly with managers, they could be former techies and might have inexperience managing team members, providing effective feedback While diversity and inclusion makes great numbers on company slides, I am not too sure if all the teams feel it.
Lots of metrics to meet, high performers considered average, entry level pay.
Still very poor pay, still doesn't cover employee health benefits 100% (like so many other companies) No longer unlimited PTO: Support was recently spoken to about a new metric that measures units of work per month. Now all performance reviews will be based on this primarily. This allows for up to five days off per quarter. Staff generally takes off more to account for burn out, but can no longer do this and still account for metrics. No more free books every month No more continuing education Asking staff to take more tickets on account of lay offs and increase need, staff is super burned out Asking staff to pick up slack on extra curricular activities while at the same time asking them to increase the number of tickets they are taking.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Mattress-Firm-Reviews-E28763.htm,"Good Money Discounts Easy job
Pay is way above minimum wage Not too hectic especially on weekdays You can sit down and get work and reading done when there's no guests You can work four days instead of five for a more work life balance.
Paid to do almost nothing all day
Heavy investment in your training and success. Intentional hiring to ensure good team dynamics. No lead generation - if you hate cold calling but love closing, this is the perfect role. Generous commissions-based compensation, especially relative to the competition. I'm getting $900-1000 sales commissions at least once a month, with a steady reliable stream of $100-$300 commissions surrounding it.
A lot of down time while at the store. Could easily get other stuff done via laptop at work. For example, take online classes etc. If at a high-volume store could potentially make 6-figures.
Making 100 K a year was entirely doable in this market before the company’s new direction. Not anymore. If you do well, be prepared for management to flood your sales floor with more sales people. So you go from 5 to 7 customers per day to 1-2. I wish that was an exaggeration. It very much is not.
High earnings potential if in a busy location.
You can look for another job while being paid as it is that slow at the vast majority of their stores.
-money is good if you know how to sell. -a decent amount of down time at work** (see cons list) -my actual direct managers where very excellent and understanding people
You have the potential to make good money when it’s busy. But be prepared for hourly checks also. Relaxing job with lots of training. The ones giving bad reviews are those who are unwilling to change or are just lazy. They literally pay you to babysit the store. What’s there to complain about? And no breaks? Again. You are sitting there all day. You can eat while you sit. Come on people. If I had one complaint would be more fair hours for family balance. That’s it.

Better than car sales or cold calls , If you have sales background you can easily hit 90/120k yearly. Average sales rep makes 65k just sitting around all day. A lot of downtown which is good you can finish some course work from school and be productive or play with your phone. Depends what kinda person you are. Deff better than most sales job. Became million dollar writer 1st year in the company. Got bunch of expensive gifts and great team work. If you’re a crab and not social it’s boring job. Co workers were family to me. Great Benefits. Bad reviews come from team members that had bad store location and didn’t know how to execute the Mattress game. Really chill job
Friendly coworkers and management Management is down-to-earth and treats employees respectfully Excellent 401k benefits Part-time work is a fit for college students Reasonable pay Facilities are well maintained Monthly lunch provided to improve employee morale Monthly ""roundtable"" meeting to discuss persistent issues and company-wide updates
Lot's of alone time, if that's your thing.
Decent training but a lot of it.
There are some great people that help you from other store because corporate does not help at all
A lot of downtime where you can maybe manage some your time with leisure of other things. Decent training , lunch and snacks. And you can make decent money if you have a good store and or you have good traffic
Excruciating amounts of downtime, planned some nice trips during those times Met some amazing people here Pay was decent for the work you do
Easy to sell brand name products. Company relies to heavily on their mattress matcher program and punishes sales people who dont use it. They've let go to sales people who didn't use mattress matcher to hire lessor performing sales people who would.

Love what I do. It keeps me busy. Great PTO benefits. Offers bcbs. Activities for a chance to show off ur skills and earn rewards.
Good money, fun environment, team building, fantastic monetary incentive
Easy free time advancement opportunities
The employee discount is decent.
Seriously none left.. Can't think of a single one. Most top performers have left.
Honestly its a little mind numbing sitting in an empty store for 11 hours, so you have time to read or work on literally anything. People can be overall nice but the nasty customers heavily outweigh the fun of having nice people.
Adequate Healthcare Benefits. Commission structure adequate.

Great culture and the local leadership really cares about its employees. You have uncapped commission and therefore, how much you choose to work and grow better in sales will directly correlate to your salary. There are people on the sales floor making $200k per year, but most people, depending on your location will make between $55k-$75k per year if full time. They give you a base pay of 1 1/2 x your local minimum wage, so for states that have $7.25 min wage, you will have base pay of $12 per hour. If you exceed this number in commission, you only receive your commission. You have the ability to make your own schedule, and essentially run your own business as a manager. Managers are compensated with bonuses in addition to commission. Very laid back environment, where when the store is dead and all tasks are completed, you may find yourself watching netflix for a couple of hours to pass the time. Loved working with 99% of the customers and creating relationships
The employee discount is decent.

Wonderful team and supporting managers.
Compensation and clientele are on par, if not better than industry standards.
Flexible Schedule Good insurance Team environment

Flexible times, decent training, good pat
Solid pay for good performance
Great uncapped commission opportunity with growth
Adequate Healthcare Benefits. Commission structure adequate.
You are guaranteed an hourly rate if you don't make your commission. They are pretty flexible with your schedule. You get to work by yourself most days, except for weekends.
It's so easy that a lot of people just watch movies and play video games between customers. The pay is amazing IF there are customers steadily coming in. You are actually encouraged to lay on the mattresses to gain understanding of how firm they are and to help break them in. That's how laid back it is. Direct management in the Columbia area are top notch. They listen and truly have an open-door policy. If there is an issue, they raise it up to upper management. There is a lot of training and role playing to get you started in the sales role. It is typically an upfront 6-week online training period. Hours can be flexible if you are upfront about not wanting to work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week. They have improved their flexibility over the years as employees have expressed their concerns over this. Employee discounts includes a friends and family discount, and they are fairly good. You do have the autonomy to change pricing as long as the company is still making a profit. The company get togethers are always fun. They have started to incorporate more company parties to help increase overall moral for the district. You can move up to store manager in this company very quickly and easily. The company is very transparent with data and your sales goals. I worked here for years because I really did like the people I worked with, the ease of the job, and the pay was alright. Read the cons to see why I left such an easy job.
full time, room for growth and being cross trained
great benefits experience good pay good store hours
Can make great money if you like selling.
Great place to work, enjoyed my time there very much. Only left because I had to move and couldn't transfer!
Relatively easy job; not physically challenging. Good stores made for good pay opportunities.
Love the people I worked with benefits were nice pay is good sometimes
I care about what I do to help other achieve their goals.
Team environment is great. Work life balance is amazing. Pay is competitive.
Some of the best sales training you will recieve
this place was a good place to work. I liked working here. I would work here again if someone called me and asked em to return. this was really great
My compensation correlates with the effort I put in I’ve finalized a million dollars of sales my first and second years, and am on track for my third My local team is fantastic! My district manager is effective
Laid back culture- as long as your store looks good and the customers are taken care of, you're free to use downtime as you please. Great support from distribution centers, large company affords done perks over competition (more inventory, faster replenishment, etc).
Good loved working with everyone
There isn't one thing good about this company.
You are by yourself most of the time.

Overall my experience with MattressFirm has been more good than bad. Do your sales job when you have too, be a part of a good team, and relax when you have some downtime if they're no customers or things to do at the moment. Get to eat lunch on your own while at your desk. However there's absolutely no work life balance in this. It's heavily focused retail sales. There will be times you sit inside the store for 10+ hours a day and have no one come in.
It was a remote position and I really enjoyed working with my team.
The company is great at marketing and at the right store you can make good money.
- Great place for a first job! They want to you read a script from a tablet that ""does all the work for you"" and suggests the same three beds to every customer. If you manage to attach all the extra garbage they want you to pedal onto your customers you'll be punished with those very accessories creating customer issues and being told by your DM to ""handle it"" so it doesn't hit their NPS scores. By that they mean give them everything for free so they shut up and you lose 50% of your commission because the ticket margin drops because why wouldn't you get punished for doing your job? - Lots of free time! Don't worry about ever being too busy though, you'll be stuffed into a store that sees no traffic (read as: No Commission) or you'll get to go to a high traffic store scheduled after the higher traffic hours come so the store managers can go home early. - Best part is the unlimited earning potential! You'll constantly be grinding away at a constantly changing ( in ways that work against the employee) commission structure that punishes effort and hard work! Great bonus potential though, don't worry John Eck and the rest of his random word titled position nepo buddies will be happily accepting your bonus on your behalf.
Uncapped Commissions and earning potential
Management is nice to work with
Good money before 2023 season
Great pay structure with base plus commission, management was decent
Good pay structure, amazing team to work with, good managerial support.
Company genuinely cares about the people. The people that work here make it all worthwhile. They value what each of us brings to the table.
None. Minimal DIRECT supervision. That is all.
- Intuitive and generally easy work - Decent labor to pay ratio - Supportive middle management
great team, very helpful when needing help on issue.
Decent money and relaxed job
Helping people every day, you’ll learn a lot about sleep, sales, marketing and there is room for advancement.
Easy to learn Mattress Matcher helps customers Great sales model and structure Great engagement with customers Team Shoutouts
Puts employees first, good pay, easy work
You can make great money without college degree. You are trained in sales, so you can earn a decent living.
The people you work with have to the biggest pro. Awesome working environment for the most part and the clients are really good aswell. The money is also very good, if you know what you’re doing.
- if you work with kind people, its worth it - good money in the summer - potential to make a lot
None-too much stress from corporate.
Great work/life balance Easy bonus metrics A lot of advancement opportunities Great support from above Room to run your team
Love the vibe of the work place and the pay but most importantly the time off that the company gives you.
Amazing staff to work with
Great retail job with flexible schedule

In sales it's the best gig out there, honestly.
Not much supervision, freedom to make decisions with little management input
pay is pretty good if you can be personable after about a year job gets pretty political and becomes about the dms pay rather than the pay of employees. loved my job here for a while until i felt like i wasn't making a difference only there for my district manager to get paid.

","Hours can be long Work weekends and holidays
You're not just a sales person, you're the receptionist. You also have to call to take care of technical issues. The wait time can be long and you can't keep guests waiting. Multiple guests can walk in and be overwhelming. You can easily miss a sale. Depending on the store and management, you can be stuck not making money. If you're in a low volume store, there's a chance your sales numbers can go down and you'll be fired or put on gbot.
Horrible management. Terrible training. They wrongfully fire people without any proper documentation under assumptions based off hearsay; even if you're in good standing with the company. Commission is a joke and they constantly dial back on how much you can earn by tweaking numbers and phrasing. Expect to work 50+ hours a week and every holiday weekend is a company wide blackout so you won't ever be allowed to have time off with your friends or family. In fact, they actually increase your hours on holiday weekends and force you to work open to close on extended hours regardless of the store is busy or not. The store I was at had a gas leak inside of it for four months before anyone took me seriously and got Xcel and the fire department involved. People will piggyback on your sales and make up excuses as to why they get the sale for themselves and then you get hit with some blanket excuse as to why they're owed part of all of the sale. They do a lot of fear mongering at this company and a lot of store managers have quit over it. Best advice is to stay away. Mattress Firm is a horrible company to work for and they don't respect anyone who works there.
Slow days happen - it's not impossible to spend an entire day in the office and make no money. Health benefits are underwhelming. Fine, but nothing to write home about. The organization is prone to making sudden changes to employee expectations with little warning or input from said employees. For every $1000 commission, there's an ocean of ""I'll be back"" (they won't) peppered with little $30-$70 payouts. Sometimes you have a bad week and your take-home is abysmal.
No growth in the company after Store Manager. Working every Holiday besides Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. Budgets are ridiculously high, so the managers never hit their budget/bonus. EVEN THOUGH Company knows business/traffic is down year over year. No incentives for staying with company.
Management is totally out of touch with what we do here. They think that we are easily replaced automatons with tablets, and they treat you as such. The experienced guys who were here, and had been here for a decade or more, are all gone. They chased them off with diminishing paychecks and a POS system that quite honestly, I don’t think they asked anybody what we actually sell here when they designed it.
10-13 hr days working by yourself with no breaks. They used to pay the meal break violations but now their doing everything they can to get you to clock out yet still work (illegal). If you can get consistent placement in a busy store the money is very good. In a slow store you will suffer. Placement and promotions are 100% based on favoritism, nepotism, or personal relationships. If you have a family forget about spending time with them. Any other hobbies or activities you engage in outside of work will suffer as well. Sales process was great when I started very straightforward. Now they force you to use a tablet and awkwardly insert using their Mattress Matcher into the sales process. Even if your a great salesperson they force you to sell using this lifeless program which caters to customers that don't want to deal with salespeople. It's designed so customers can use the app to shop in store without interacting with a person (so it's pretty obvious their long term plan is to eliminate us from the process). If the customer uses the app this way and checks out on their phone then we get zero commission even if we helped them. Horrible computer system! Literally torture to use. They are very proud of it, and it is the most glitchy, slow, frustrating POS system I've ever used. Totally incompetent District Managers, and upper management always patting themselves on the back. Constant delivery screwups by the warehouse and delivery team. They don't care because we're the ones who have to listen to angry customers scream at us on the phone. So happy to be moving on!
They illegally refuse to pay their employees overtime. Managers are paid barely more than their associates and expected to do the majority of the work. The training is non existent. People are overworked, underpaid, promised HUGE bonuses which only happen in specific stores. Then when your store doesn’t perform to standards that are literally not achievable the regional managers will literally laugh and say they know it’s not really possible in the Seattle Market. Oh and they are a very backwards company. I was told by a supervisor that they didn’t agree with my lifestyle LGBTQ. They have kept staff that have said the hard “n” word at work and those employees were not black. There was literally no garbage or recycling service at my store and they were always perplexed by it but did nothing to fix it. They expect 100% compliance to a tool that doesn’t work and will be doing away with desktops in place of it. The Wi-Fi is so horrible they don’t function so that will be fun. Management is all idiotic sales people with no management or operations experience being promoted in a favoritism practice.
-10 hour work days every day - **The number one problem and the aspect that made me finally quit was the customer service complaints. The customer service department is you. If the phone rings, you and you alone have to fix the issue not matter what it is. The phone rings constantly and because you are paid on commission you are basically working as an unpaid customer service department more than you are a salesperson. -money depends entirely on how lucky you are with store placement. if you are at a store in a poor area or a store with poor foot traffic you will not make much -Constant sales meetings that cut into your earnings -""We have a great company culture here"" i.e. I was chastised by an upper level leader for not looking excited enough during the mandatory pep rally style hype meeting. -cumbersome tablet interface created by the marketing department that you are forced to use if certain leadership is present. Personally cost me sales on more than one occasion -its a 100% commission job. base pay is taken away as soon as you make above it in commission. -if you have an off month, you are punished severely, even if your numbers where previously good
The commission structure changes make it hard to pinpoint exactly where we should be, which can be frustrating. There needs to be more compensation for the ones making the millions for this company. Otherwise is ok.

Certain stores have less foot traffic and over employed people, hope they are fixing that issue. Inflation and economy affected a lot
Be prepared for heavy lifting in the warehouse Work is tiring and draining at times, including lots of standing Hit or miss on whether coworkers care about doing their jobs with other employees in mind Building subject to excessive heat and cold during summer and winter Some lift trucks have ongoing, unaddressed issues despite being reported
Long hours of solitude and boredom, low pay, on demand travel to other stores. Expect daily delivery problems, which you'll have to resolve yourself. Totally useless, not to mention ridiculous sales meetings. Don't be fooled. You aren't hired for one or two stores, your hired for ALL of the stores. Typical schlock organization that acts like it's curing cancer.
Pay is not good. They claim it is but it is not. When it is slow they say we the employees can fix that by posting on social media our selves. You spend hours sitting alone waiting for a customer to walk in. Mattress Firm claims they care about work life balance. They don’t support that with the hours you demand people work. The abuse employees go through from customers when the Mattress they purchased fails. They do fail on a regular basis and Mattress Firm claim the employee sold the customer the wrong Mattress and you deduct from employee pay when a customer exchanges or returns the mattress.
When you follow their directive with holding associates accountable they dont stand behind you if they complain about. Many associates are only there for the hourly not to commission
I normally don’t like saying bad things I was really appreciative of getting a job and it worked out great it’s just this just happened And if anyone see this review is 100% truth if you wanna take your time with this company go for it ,,,,but you may not get the results that you want . First know you’re worth protect yourself and realize that you’re gonna take something in your core ability that you may not can get out very easy . Too much downtime. You become unique United with that structure . First hand You will not have a probably structure knowledge of business protocol. Damaging to your integrity of self worth the training is A smokescreen they program you to do all this meaning it all great. Not so good psychology but luckily I’m a psychology major and your morale , time is important for you and not other direction your sanity . The major thing they push…. Just sell . GrinD make some money.. That is Just enough for half of profit of time And each they should understand how the margin works each margin from east to west overall business percentage as a whole is lack of merit of experience.Flaw first in the company. And they should know when you inspire interest on a channel called Teams as a whole why would you put everyone else out there when everyone is as not in as a hole and with the same mirrors a brain is discouragement and disapproval at your performers especially if. If associates and certain stores are not in the same type of lifestyle in some stores are not gonna perform like inland store your mall stores I don’t get it why they tend to think this is very influential and uplifting , district of stores have different businesses everyone knows that from real estate . So they seem to not want to see the truth. Or maybe they do.!!!!and they want what they want 40 +60 hour max overall same result. No time away or time allocated for your presence at working at the company never adds up you’re actually paying them more to work for them than what they’re paying you Means time to move on . I should’ve seen light of up front truth. My bad!!!! It was good at first until your margin of life profit goes through the wind. And listen to others reviews. A company who very high turnover rate. And regardless of spectacle criticism it is true and is very disappointing and very sad the answer to question. Is the question. Why is Mattress firm so cold out of any sense of what they portrayed is not the actual reality feels like you were in some dream and you can’t seem to really understand that you’re awake we get it ! Mattress firm. We have to be firm and be like you . Resilient in and look after your self only together realize this is just another part of learning about certain jobs and you move on. fired half of your upper mstructure and so forth where you can see but somehow it doesn’t hit you and seems hell that everyone is saying the same things do you tell yourself is it truth.
This company was good to me in the beginning, then the storm came… Long hours while some days not seeing anyone, have to be both extroverted and introverted to do this job Too much change; after COVID the company changed big time, they instilled uniforms, threatened to be publicly traded, and gave us a tablet to trick customers into believing bulls*** data. Once they teamed with sleepscore labs s*** rlly hit the fan, had to wear the dumbest uniform; looked like we worked at your local best buy. we used to look professional Upper leadership only cares about themselves, it’s one big acting job for these guys, as long as they get their paycheck, they don’t care about the sales people on the floor, seriously. But, if you play their game you’ll get out alive, too bad it’s so hard to pretend to like these people It truly is just another corporate circus in there so be warned.

Will deny ada requests that are reasonable. IF you have a hard time with constant change, time blindness, adhd, broken agreements, not everyone on the same page, or autism do not apply. Benefits are great except the Express scripts. All meds I need to funtion are no longer covered. Including my adhd meds that are 175. Also if there are technical problems it is all on you. Pto can get used up quickly for their technical issues. Customers can be abusive, so if you are rejection sensitive or can not mask this is not for u. They can say u are chat only but asked or mandatorially be moved to be on phones or any dept they feel like.
Very long hours, little hoildays, management if unlucky, salary based on demand
Commission slow some times meetings
Working at Mattress Firm can be quite impersonal. Employees often feel like they're treated as mere numbers, lacking the personal touch. Safety concerns in the stores are not given much attention, which can be disheartening. Furthermore, the company seems to be cutting costs more frequently, leading to the elimination of perks like company-paid dinners, parties, contests, and bonuses. It's worth noting that this trend started even before the COVID-19 pandemic, although it tends to be used as an excuse. The pay scale at Mattress Firm is not competitive, and employees don't receive raises unless the minimum wage laws force them.
Long 10 hour shifts, reduced traffic, overstaffed stores, commission cuts, benefit cuts, unobtainable bonus structure, no worklife balance, no rewards, no incentives, bad culture. Most all SE's looking for employment elsewhere.
While they make it seem like it is a aggressive sales job, its honestly just based on if customers see any actual value in the product they are purchasing. You will more than likely not make commission all that often, and you will likely take on more responsibilities than you expect. Be prepared to work at multiple stores. You will be let go if you do not meet certain sales targets based on a Monthly algorithm. They will expect you to drive far distances unpaid. They will have you change out all of the marketing every two weeks and throw way 40 lbs of paper just to put up 65 more lbs of marketing material only to have 8 people per week view it per store. This happens at EVERY store.
Long hours (typical of retail). New District Managers are not knowledgeable and lack the skill set for a District Manager position (customers have explicitly commented on several occasions the lack of knowledge of a particular DM compared to the Store Manager). Corporate management rolls out new POS and customer interaction software that continuously has bugs, provides inaccurate information, etc and threatens to terminate employees if they don't utilize the flawed software program for every customer.
Mattress matcher, secret shops, did I mention mattress matcher and secret shops.
Poor health care costs. Expect to pay about $500/mo for you and your spouse. You don't get hourly + commission on your checks. Low base pay between $24k-$30k in my area, and with any sales job, there will be dead periods where you go home with an hourly check. Pay is very inconsistent depending on store traffic. You can make $4,000 on one check and then $950 on the next one. If your delivery warehouse is not good, they will impact your pay in a negative way.
Working at Mattress Firm can be quite impersonal. Employees often feel like they're treated as mere numbers, lacking the personal touch. Safety concerns in the stores are not given much attention, which can be disheartening. Furthermore, the company seems to be cutting costs more frequently, leading to the elimination of perks like company-paid dinners, parties, contests, and bonuses. It's worth noting that this trend started even before the COVID-19 pandemic, although it tends to be used as an excuse. The pay scale at Mattress Firm is not competitive, and employees don't receive raises unless the minimum wage laws force them.
Long 10 hour shifts, reduced traffic, overstaffed stores, commission cuts, benefit cuts, unobtainable bonus structure, no worklife balance, no rewards, no incentives, bad culture. Most all SE's looking for employment elsewhere.
Lack of work at times
Lots of downtime, too many menial tasks that are far too strictly watched over, management is very inconsistently great. Some managers are godsends, almost are pencil pushers who just happened to have a few seasons of good sales. Hours are god awful.
Straight commissions no base pay we
While they make it seem like it is a aggressive sales job, its honestly just based on if customers see any actual value in the product they are purchasing. You will more than likely not make commission all that often, and you will likely take on more responsibilities than you expect. Be prepared to work at multiple stores. You will be let go if you do not meet certain sales targets based on a Monthly algorithm. They will expect you to drive far distances unpaid. They will have you change out all of the marketing every two weeks and throw way 40 lbs of paper just to put up 65 more lbs of marketing material only to have 8 people per week view it per store. This happens at EVERY store.
Long hours, holidays you work
Retail so working every holiday
I can not think of one

If you don't like sales, you wont like the job.
I often felt like I was wasting my time in a mattress store just watching TikTok's or playing video games. Traffic slowed down a lot and therefore pay was cut down to getting the hourly pay ($10.88 an hour) instead of the commission pay. Because there wasn't the same traffic as seen as in the past, data was skewed and made sales goals almost unreachable. This caused upper management to focus on the employees with lower numbers instead of the district's performance as a whole. Safety is minimal. There are no panic buttons, cameras, and the front doors do not lock properly. If there was a safety issue or something broke in the store, you had to go through a broken system where the company would hire the least expensive contractor. This led to issues being written off as completed when they were not so that the contractor could get paid. Because you often work alone due to low traffic, you are not allowed to leave to get food. You have to bring your food or order it. If someone calls out, you are either left to work solo all day or call different stores in the Columbia area to see if someone is willing to come work at your store. Stores are often short staffed, so getting someone to work at a different store was a shot in the dark. There is also an ongoing moral issue causing employees not to work at certain stores or to quit altogether. Especially the Lexington stores. The top sales performer gets away with almost anything because he makes the most money for the district. Other stores often got customers that visited the Lexington stores and this salesperson specifically because he was so mean to them when they said they didn't want to spend thousands on a bed. They would literally walk out the store and visit a different location because of his behavior. If you have an issue and rise it to upper management about this person, it will be swept under the rug because they need the money this person makes for the company. Money really does get you anything here. The company is often changing sales tactics and you have to be adaptive to constantly changing sales goals and new technology they are constantly experimenting with to increase customer experience. This new technology is not well received by the majority of the sales force. Working with the warehouse was a nightmare. I often lost sales due to the delivery team not taking proper care of the products and telling the customers wrong information. This would lead to nasty calls from the customer to the store and we are not given the best tools to solve these issues. We are either told to discount the customer ticket, which is money out the salespersons pocket for a mistake that was not their fault, or have the delivery team go back out, but this was almost never the same day, causing more anger since the guest has to rearrange their schedule again. The warehouse delivery drivers are from third party contractors, and they are not given hands on training for setting up products, so reporting issues was a waste of time. It was easy for the drivers to change their company name and be added back to the driver lists, meaning if they were kicked from our operations team, it was easy for them to be rehired under a different name and work for Mattress Firm again. I personally witnessed confrontations with the warehouse manager and employees due to these issues. Overall, if you go into this job with the mindset that this isn't your forever job, most of these things are minor and it's worth it the headaches. The job is so easy, and the pay is decent for what you are doing. Now if you are going in thinking you're going to make a career, you're going to drive yourself mad. It's really difficult to get past the store manager role without having to move to a different state.
none at this time, I enjoyed the comoany
work life balance have to travel
Long work day hours. Could also be slow most days.
The amount of secret shoppers was annoying
Bad stores made for terrible pay opportunities. Regular required meetings outside business hours that are unpaid due to nature of commission structure. Very little pay security as you are assigned stores and hours somewhat haphazardly. Commission structure also changes every year or two which results in lowered commissions. Extremely high turnover rate.
Say goodbye to your home life open door policy is a joke Undervalued as an employee Overworked, nothing was ever good enough
Long hours very low pay for the effort.
Poor district manager. Poor Management. They will write you up for doing something they told you to do and turn their back on you.
Work alone in a store, long hours, work on holidays
none that I can think of
Not for those who don’t like sales You’ll work holidays, evenings and weekends District manager and leadership team really sets the tone for the market
Inconsistent at times with expectations, no urgency in employee development
Great not bad at all
Leadership is HORRIBLE, if you want to call it leadership. You're in competition with leadership for sales.
You are lucky to get 1 or 2 people in on a weekday
Lots of hours, far commutes and pay is heavily dependent on location of store
Work life balance was the main issue I saw
Lots of politics, long hours and holiday work.

Very unorganized and a lack of transparency / communication.
Excessive micro-management through tech and excessive training. Always changing their systems.
- You can't make commission Management making millions in bonuses while we continue to get screwed on our commissions and bonuses. If you sell everything what it is priced at you make 50% of your commission because of the three margin tiers. If you screw over your customer in fun various ways you can earn back the commission you are owed. - They boast how employee pay went up 15% and 68% of employees made more this year than last year. They conveniently left out that minimum wage went up in the country to account for those averages. You should have used median, not average, we all don't make $38 an hour like the Bay Area stores. - No Bonuses Budgets aren't set based on traffic and business conditions. They are set in a way to ""manage employee expenses"" in other words they don't believe you deserve to make they same money they do. - Losing PTO Jody Putnam came out and said we made too much in terms of our compensation package, so instead of effecting the commission we can't earn, they took away our PTO because how dare you attempt to have a life? How dare you have a family? How dare you try to have fulfillment. - Constantly shrinking Commission Plan If you find a way to make money don't worry, they'll take that away and reduce commissions and do it quietly and hope you don't notice. - Performance Plans while succeeding You think that taking high in the score boards makes you safe from losing your job? False. They will put half a district on a Performance Plan right before one of the biggest selling holidays of the year and ask us to KEEP OUR ENERGY UP WOOOO SALES SHOUT IT OUT BABY WOOWHOO FREE ADJUSTABLE BASE CUSTOMER FOR LIFE when you are about to lose your job next month. - Out of Touch Management Don't worry about ever getting promoted. They hate that. The idea of a retail employee making a decent life is the most unfathomable thing to middle management and upper management. They are so out of touch they started this thing about earning well to live well. Literally told us they know we don't make enough to support our families so here are ways you can screw over your customer to make more money. It's a joke.
Not a good work life balance poor communication with operations lead to inventory issues costing sleep experts money since you are paid on delivery. Late Nights Work most Major Holidays and weekends around them.
Pay, schedule, time off was better
Cutbacks to get ready for new owners
Lots of hours, far commutes and pay is heavily dependent on location of store
Work life balance was the main issue I saw
Can be set in their ways at times. Change is not always easy.
Too many. Let's bullet point it. * Performance Plans: Someone is ALWAYS on the chopping block. You are constantly compared to everyone else (in public) and the low man goes. It is like a game of Survivor. My district just fired a MILLION DOLLAR writer! Explain that please. * POOR Leadership. John Eck and others are raking in multi-million dollar bonuses every year, then pressuring salespeople because the company is ""losing money."" * ALL Failings get blamed on the sales staff. From rising margins to failed deliveries and supply chain issues... it ALWAYS negatively impacts the sales team, and no one else. *Horrible Work/Life balance. They keep extending hours and it is universal for ALL stores. Only a few select locations REALLY need to open at 9:00 on a Holiday or stay open until 9:00... but they make EVERYONE suffer so they can get that bonus money for execs... * Poor pay - you can probably infer this from the other items, but Mattress Firm only gives you a (poor) base salary if you don't hit enough commissions, and you will NEVER hit enough unless you are in one of the few ""fast floors.""
- Upper management will lie whenever possible - The wage and schedule you were promised at the interview will likely NOT be what you get once hired - Job listing is inaccurate and you will have differing responsibilities than what was discussed in the interview
no real cons, great working environment
Horrible work life balance. Not good to have kids in this job. The schedules are terrible.
Retail hours, all hands on deck for weekends and holidays, bonus structure for management isn’t get and has decreased in my time here
Delivery team is horrible Work long hours 10 hour shifts moving locations to other stores employees can take your sales delivery team can ruin your commissions by terrible delivery Not much movement After 6 months
Work 10-8 during the week, and most weekends
Retail so weekends and holidays are required.
Upper level management doesn’t not care about unless you only make hourly, then they will fire you. They are less concerned with what the sales people (back bone of the business) are saying, but will make sure you have 10-15 courses for training. The advertise on tv and in general that everything is basically free, when people come in they demand the free items, we have to give it to them and then upper management puts the sales people on PIPS or outright fired. You can tell that upper management has never sold anything and they wouldn’t last a min on the sales floor.
- work/life balance - tons of unpaid required meetings - cutting reward programs and incentives - profiting more but not rewarding employees as much
Constant push for technology that doesn't work. Horrible point of sale system. Ridiculous tablets to carry around for show. Unqualified paid shoppers sent to harass and lie about the salespeople. Unscrupulous corporate stealing from the salespeople via commissions manipulation. Free Delivery chargeback despite charging the customer a delivery fee. Free base chargeback even though the company claims it as a marketing loss. More than double the cost of financing charged against the salesperson for using the finance the company advertises. No advertising creativity. Same sale running for 7yrs straight. Salespeople are blamed for lower quantities of sales for the companies poor corporate management.
Benefits are good but priced high
You will work longer hours and mandatory working on the weekends and holidays.
Not many down sides. Good learning experience
There aren't to many cons

It's sales I mean come on.
Not much teaching or mentoring for employees especially for employees of color
politics. they make moves based on managers pay and don't care how it affects the sleep expert position on a personal level.

Other than literally having industry leading commission-schemes (which I will non-confrontationally argue to anyone who’d like to challenge otherwise), Thor Companies is an extremely fair business, in terms of treating people like human-beings and not solely a number. Unlike the majority of other recruitment agencies, Thor offers flexible hours, extremely achievable/generous incentives, and the opportunity to be a true business owner and entrepreneur of the space/sector you’re developing. In addition, if you’d like to implement an idea within the business (that has logic/value), Thor will allow you to do so! The only time when Thor will become a bit stricter, is when the consultant’s behavior warrants such actions to occur. Lord knows, most other agencies would action much worse in a quicker time frame, which is a testament to Thor’s fairness. If you think achieving Thor’s weekly standards of - 3 CV’s, 2 First Interviews, and 1 job pulled is not achievable/unfair - then you will be in for a rude awakening for the next business you join.

The pros of working with a team whose mission is to provide resources to assist with school readiness? I mean, each day we are actively Achieving Beyond Life’s Expectations. The name says it all. I have worked with ABLE Kids under many hats - RBT, Case Manager/Clinical Assistant, and BCBA. Under each role I have felt an incredible amount of support; especially during a time in which my health took a turn for the worse. They supported me through it and coming out of it I felt empowered. ABLE Kids touches the lives of the individuals we serve, yes, but the work we put in does not go unnoticed. The CEO makes sure we are reminded of this through his words and more importantly his actions. The main take away is how I have worded working with ABLE Kids - I am proud to say I do not work FOR a company, but WITH a company each day to support individuals become school ready.

","No cons I can think of
Initially, I was excited upon receiving the job offer from the company. I immersed myself in the training they provided. However, it didn't take long for me to recognize the demanding nature of the role, requiring me to dedicate around 10 to 11 hours each day, sometimes even more, to fulfill my responsibilities. They claim unlimited vacations, but the average employee only takes about 2 weeks a year. The company's work culture heavily emphasizes communication through emails, frequent lengthy meetings, and also a goal oriented software called Lattice. As a result, the available time for focused work seems to be limited to mostly evenings or weekends. This disrupts the work-life balance. Another aspect that struck me was the high turnover rate at the company. Unlike any other organization I've been a part of, it's evident that they experience a consistent influx of new hires and departures. This constant cycle of hiring and firing creates an air of instability within the company. While my initial excitement about joining the company was strong, the realities of the demanding work hours, communication-heavy culture, and high turnover have collectively raised concerns about the long-term viability of this professional journey. Jeremy and Frieda are great. Some of the other Senior Management, not so much.
Poor management all around. People who work hard and voice their opinions on issues get fired or removed from management positions. Others who whine and kiss butt get whatever they want. Immature employees get promote to positions they can't handle. The store wants to cut back on hours for certain employees, while others get approved to work 60 plus hours a week. Pay isn't great. Can't live off what you get paid there. McDonald's or other retail stores pay more. You have to tip toe around certain employees because they will go cry to management and get their way. It's an unfair company. All employees get treated differently. Ones who call out all the time, show up late or leave early just get a slap on the hand and nothing else is done. Corporate needs to do a better job at fixing issues.
Management is all over the place. There are tons of miscommunication. I didn’t get my equipment until the day before my job started. We didn’t even start training until the second week and some of the tasks I was given was completely unnecessary from what I signed up for . After I left the company I was told that I would get packages in UPS to return my equipment. Over a month goes by and no sign of that and then I was told I had to drop them off to UPS with return instructions sent to me over a month after I left the company!!! I was very let down and disappointed.
At first this was the best debt settlement company I have been with in the 6 years I’ve done this. I have been with the company for one year and they have changed the commission structure twice. The first change wasn’t too bad and I was still able to make good money. The recent change is so drastic that literally only 5 out of 100+ reps will make decent money. The others are working just as hard and won’t make anything near the top 5%. You cannot take time off or else you lose most of your income. They favor certain reps and leave scraps for the rest. The compensation will not be sufficient to survive on and is already causing many reps to leave.
Some times the traveling can be a bit much with delays and having to feel like everything needs to be accomplished
not any cons honestly there are very humble
A development area is hiring more strategically going forward and driving a consistent strategy across each Business Unit.
Upper management is very insecure and creates riff in the workplace. Terrible bosses who are not seasoned to run a company of this size. Retaliation by not including you in meetings, stealing your ideas and work to pass off as their own is standard practice at Loungefly. If you are knowledgeable and have experience, you are not welcome and will be slayed for knowing too much. Needs new leadership, current leadership is only fit to run $50 million dollar company and not for a $250 million dollar company. Not much room for growth , they will try to keep you in the same position.

Doing anything not related to your actual job. It's stressful!
This company is, without a doubt, the worst I have ever encountered. Their work ethic is non-existent, and their laziness is evident in their attempts to scam people for money. I cannot stress this enough: under no circumstances should you engage in any business dealings with anyone associated with this company. Their sole focus is on taking money from your pocket and nothing else. I am sharing this warning to protect others from falling victim to their scams.
Some down sides are schedule changes that are all of a sudden

Unprofessional top management, no clue what they doing. Top management do not have experience in Fashion. Lots of “like you/ dislike you” decisions. Skills does not matter. Long hours, no balance in life, no appreciation.
Approach with extreme caution. This is a workplace where prejudice runs rampant and team members are belittled. After a few months I noticed a disturbing pattern. Employees are frequently targeted for dismissal as part of a power move from above to test loyalty among managers. Instead of hiring those with real, outside management experience, they promote those who are willing to bend to the crude tactics of a way-too-hands-on CEO who refuses to create a workplace built on trust, empathy or respect. Don’t be fooled by the fake reviews. They’ve strong-armed the staff or an outside service to post positive ones. Find a workplace where you're treated well, can trust your team, and you’re allowed to do your job.

Plenty of friendly coworkers of many ages. Makes working experience more fun and exciting. Would get stressful and super busy, but when everyone is working quick to ensure efficiency, the adrenaline rush is fun. Managers and crewmembers are understanding when you make mistakes. Training is thorough and provides good feedback and chances to learn. Free crew member drinks during shifts. Scheduling is fairly easy if you plan ahead, and is mostly consistent/fixed scheduling but deviates sometimes. Requesting time off in advance is easy.
Very collaborative work environment and very fun office to work from. The culture shows throughout everyone at the office.
People and customers are both usually great.
The culture truly is one of a kind. I've met some amazing people at this place and it probably is the easiest fast food place you can have
It was very clean, got to wear hats instead of hair nets
Only pros is the schedule flexibility that other company’s don’t offer.
Great company, who cares about its employees and how they experience work. Great customer service. Amazing training program. Career growth
Fun environment, good music, fast paced because we are quite busy at my location. Usually everyone is cool and is all about communication. Be there on Time and try hard that’s it. Fun and easy gig
Very welcome and thorough with their training.. Very welcoming as well
Fun Concept, Work with great people.
Company continues to grow and add positions. Great culture, great work life balance, opportunities for internal and external growth. Fun environment and even more amazing people!

Cool staff, good work environment
Good food, discount, good team
My store I worked at had a great environment and atmosphere! really enjoyed my time there
Really care about their people Great CEO Fun environment
They live by their values: Great crew - I loved the people I worked with. It always made mesmile going to work. Cool culture - the company wants it to be a fun place to work and they ensure it is with regular company hosted events and incentives. Active community involvement - my store was always at a school event or function and hosting fundraising events. They have some of the best integrity I've seen in a company, the system is designed to ensure your time off once approved and they don't shame you for taking sick leave. I loved the comapny.
Super friendly environment, clean, consistent, and better pay than most fast food places
Friendly work environment and very clean

The food, serving customers, backing the Cane’s mission statement
Pay and people are cool
Canes as a corporation does a great job ensuring a positive atmosphere and great culture. Of all the restaurants I have worked at, supported, and trained at- they all knew how to work hard and have fun. I started as a near minimum wage employee and am now a salary manager. They truly care about developing their employees and I would not be the same person I am if I hadn’t worked at Canes.

Every Canes that I have worked at has welcomed me with open arms. Even every individual that I have met is unique!

There is a lot of schedule flexibility, which i love since i am still in school. it is an easy to learn environment and to have fun. We are a team and we all help each other out.

1. Very Flexible 2. Patient 3. Goal Oriented
Pay, benefits, company culture, office perks
Initial training of me I felt was done very well, it was very comprehensive and easy to understand what was asked of me. I also thought that it was a nice and friendly environment, with all the managers, and workers in general, being understanding individuals that were always willing to help or understanding if you messed up. The company was also extremely efficient, with very good management, everybody always was working on something and because of that efficiency it avoided many stresses that you would normally find at a jobsite, such as getting flooded with customers.

With the right management and crew, you can really shine here at Cane’s. My location works together to solve problems and to build each other up every day. It really does feel like a big family!

","If you don’t invest in good shoes your feet will HURT
Fast paced Repetitive Scheduling hours
*There is a very big disconnect between employee and employer. There is an emphasis on giving opportunities to those who work for them, but these never happen in some locations where the management is incompetent. *Even if you are a leader in your restaurant as a crewmember, if you don't suck up to certain managers then they will absolutely halt your progress towards a pathway into management. *New Restaurant Opener is just a title. You do not receive the advertised additional pay if you are in your home restaurant. I have been making the same, if not less than the rest of the crew here despite having the experience and title of NRO. In addition to this, you are still required to provide the services that an NRO brings to a restaurant open. *I applied as a full time NRO trainer and I have opened just 1 restaurant in the last 15 months as a trainer, despite being told that I should be opening restaurants consistently throughout the time as a trainer.
Will work you over your time if short staffed Adult usually aren’t given breaks Management would rather hire externally or promote store favorites versus merits and experience
Very stressful, fast pase and hot
Get used to interesting customers. No customer service job is easy and working here is no exception. It also can get stressful at times that are extremely busy.
Hours Pay rate Management Environment
Work life balance sometimes is skewed
Pay could be a little better, but you get opportunities quick.
Schedules get changed all the time without warning, workers put you with trainers and then expect you to know everything quick and put you in positions that make you uncomfortable.
I don’t have any to give!
Bad direct oversight from my in restaurant bosses
Unsure when breaks will be, depends on the busyness of shift/day. Shift meals are half off, not free. Cannot get employee discount unless you are working that day. Some managers are friendly, some managers like to joke around and get on your toes.
Things can sometimes happen really fast without ample time for good planning, and as a result work sometimes isn't as good as it could be.
Unfair treatment by playing favorites.
After 3 years, I realize I was taken advantage of. As a 16-17 year old, I was scheduled at least 3–4 times a week closing shifts. As a minor and still in school, I'm sure there are some laws against this. I was working 4:45pm-11:30-45pm on school nights. It was rare I was given a break other than sneaking off to the back for some food. During the height of covid there one week I worked overtime and even the region manager assisting didn't give me a break. After a year at the same location, I had only been given a $0.95 raise in total. Which was ridiculous considering they tried to manipulate me into becoming a manager as soon as I graduated from high school. It wasn't until I put in my two weeks that the manager started cutting me some slack. My new store is better I will say that
We gave our school schedule to our manager. She scheduled me right during a final exam. I contacted her and let her know of the conflict (which was her fault) and she said it was my responsibility to find someone to cover my shift, or I would get a point against me. I asked everyone and of course no one could covee. It is the most boring fast food job. There's only a handful of things on the menu. Toast (I felt so sorry for those people), chicken, and coleslaw. So you either stood over a stove buttering and flipping toast for hours, cooking the chicken, or prepping boxes or baskets. If you're on prep you were also responsible for salting and mixing fries with your hands. You only had cooking gloves on which did nothing to protect from the heat, and you had to do this when they came straight out of the fryer. Chicken was also made fresh so you had to pick it up with your hands. Gloves would get hard and break from the heat and they had to be replaced frequently. They pride themselves on the ""perfect plate"". It was so ridiculous that if you handed off a to-go box and the window person checked it, if the fork wasn't the right direction facing the right angle it was handed back to correct it. I promise no one has ever noticed where their fork is in the box. It gets bumped around anyway. Plus no one really knew which way it was supppsed to go. Every person had a different explanation, which was ridiculous. They would say ""L for Love"" and make a swooping motion with their hand for which way the fork would curve. The problem is everyone did a different direction. Plus the pay was horrible. I would work any other job for less pay before I would ever work there again, no matter how much they paid me. Oh and after you're there for x amount of time (can't remember exactly it was a long time though) you get a signed hard hat! How cool is that! (complete sarcasm)
I’ve been working for this company for almost 3 years, my whole 3 years working here have been horrendous. Management is very toxic at my location. All managers have been extremely rude, have yelled at me have degraded me and embarrassed me in front of others, including both restaurant managers. These managers were that bad to the point where they’ve made me cry during my shifts and after my shifts. The restaurant manager once yelled at me in front of the customers and my coworkers while I was working front counter cashier. He claimed I needed to needed to help the customers out first before coworkers but that wasn’t the case a course I was helping out customers first. I am hispanic and I started working here since I was 16, I strongly believe I’ve been taken advantaged of and discriminated just because of my young age and my ethnicity. I was always kind to all my my coworkers and managers and always very helpful which is all these factors that led to all of these managers taking advantage of my innocence and deciding to yell at me. I’ve met wonderful people working here but the management is not it. Canes, you should feel ashamed of yourself for hiring managers who don’t have any type of shame screaming at crew members. I’ve never felt so humiliated in my life working for this company that’s done nothing but degrade me. Canes is fully responsible for this toxic management since Managers are trained to “yell” at crewmembers.
Training is away from home, long hours
Not enough $ for me. I put in my 2 weeks and moving on soon but I have nothing but love for the company.
Can't think of anything well wearing your hit after the store closed and free of customers is a little extreme. Sometime when you bending down and cleaning the hat can just be in the way
None to come to mind
Very fast paced environment, some days can be long
promotions, repetitive, pay, benefits, opportunities.
Favoritism with crew and scheduling
Favoritism in rules, and scheduling.
Seeming to have lower pay than other fast food jobs
Over complicate things Work a lot of hours
Upper middle management (regional leaders) always micromanaged and never actually listened to restaurant leadership when they would voice concerns. Most notably crew cup lids never matched the cups but we were required to use them and so had to tape lids onto cups.
No breaks, managers can be stingy about employees eating food
Low pay for a lot of work
management sucked, scheduling sucked, the people sucked
Busy, broken acs, toxic environment
They close very late at night
Base pay per hour is $12. Not for those who need to pay a lot of bills. Takes about 6 months to get a raise. Not for those who cannot stand on their feet for more than 6+ hours.
Middling pay, though improved in recent years. Hard, sometimes grueling work keeping up with popular locations in back-of-house positions.
Work culture isn’t always the best, sometimes the overtime hours are too much
Can get really busy and hectic
Sometimes it can be difficult to manage a work-life balance. It can be easy to get caught up in the stress of a very busy shift, but nothing too unbearable. There are high expectations for performance, and metrics that are very important to the company. We take a lot of pride in what we do though, so I do not see it as much of a con.
Nothing bad to say about canes

Very busy during the school year and dead in summers
Only cons is who you working with
Hours aren't always consistent. They can change very drastically depending on the time of year due to holidays, school, etc.
Gets very stressful (as a closer), very little help when closing (0-2 pre-closers, if very luck 3 pre closers), strict protocols, No free food :(.
Late night college towns and late shifts
- it can be stressful due to how busy it can get - getting stuck in the same position every day

May need more cooks maybe more or less customer rep.

I worked for the company for almost 8 years. This was the best and most fun working experience I have ever had. I started as a crew member, then became a certified trainer/bird specialist, then joined the NRO team before being promoted into management. I ended up having to leave the company in 2021 due to having some issues with my pregnancy. I left the right way so that I would be able to go back once I was ready. When I was ready I reapplied to a location closer to home and was rejected and told I want eligible for rehire. I still have the messages with my OM in whom I submitted my notice to to prove I left the right way. This is not a way to appreciate someone who dedicated close to a decade to the company. 2 years later and I still hold hurt about it.

Company was a bit unreliable when it came to communication, often managers would not respond to texts or emails. Schedule was also inflexible at times, with you being either over scheduled or under scheduled on hours.
no tips were allowed to be accepted

Top leadership feels disconnected from the employees. Some more so than others. There is very little actual collaboration between teams even in the same department. Everyone stays in there silo and are then scrambling to fix something last minute because they didn't involve all the people that were needed to complete their project or task. My departmental leader never seemed to actually understand what my team's job was, but wanted to have a say in the decisions we made as if they were the expert. Very little respect from upper management. Work life balance is terrible. You will often work long into the night or be pulled into emergencies that completely disrupt whatever you have going on. This is made worse by the fact that teams are not redundantly staffed, so you are typically the ONLY person in the company who knows how to do your job. It results in essentially being on call 24/7. This problem also causes issues when someone leaves, because there aren't enough other people to evenly pick up the slack while the replacement job req goes through several layers of approval all the way to the Co-CEO. The CEO seems to have lost his focus on the business and is more concerned with celebrity than keeping things running smoothly. There is no prioritization of tasks and projects. Everything is the top priority all the time, so nothing is ever really your top priority. You're just expected to work longer hours to meet the constantly shifting demands. There is an inconsistent work from home policy, in that there is no official policy. Some teams have people who only come into the office once a week. Other teams get ""flex"" days on Monday or Friday. Other teams aren't allowed to work from home at all. It's left up to your department or team leadership to make the decision, and if they are anti-WFH then you don't get the same benefits as your coworkers in this regard. It seems like upper management's way of just not dealing with the growing pressure to have WFH options. This did not happen to me, but I have had new hires tell me after a few months in position that everything they were told in the interview, including the job description, was basically a lie to get you excited about the opportunity. I can say that in my time in my position my job description changed multiple times despite my title and pay not being changed to compensate. All of these changes resulted in an increase in work load and responsibilities without compensation.
it is alot of hard physical work to keep the store clean and running effectively and efficiently however it’s apart of What We Do.
Very boring, hours feel like days
Theres days where the customers are gonna keep coming but it is a popular restaurant. If you one position to long your body will be sore
Lot of work and effort not bad but is the only con consistently working to improve your business
Not the best decison making from mangement.
People are rude but let’s get money
When I was working I would only get one shift per week even tho I signed up for full time.
Management values and soft skills aren’t consistant throughout all Cane’s, but that is an impossible feat, so it’s to be expected. Sometimes my position isn’t respected from crew, but it’s important to push forward and focus on your job, not others.
As with any fast food chain, some issues are slow to be addressed. (Not particular to store)
I believe that the only thing I think we as a business should do to work better overall, is to just have a better working environment.
Physically demanding Relying on coworkers to finish tasks as a team
Physical labor, high volume, tough work
Very fast paced and hectic
Less hours depending on amount of employees.
busy busy busy busy sbys
You need to be able to handle really hot food and work at a very quick pace
It is usually really busy, especially on nights.
sometimes it can be really busy and overwhelming
Often cut hours from people
Don't bring up harassment Constant argumentative and condescending managers
No breaks unless you work eight hours or more, no free food, managers consistently make you stay longer than scheduled, they hire everyone that walks in so you don't get enough hours, and they expect you to be a ""walking flipbook of information"" but won't pay you appropriately to be so. They expect you to know the mission and vision like it's your own business but expect to be looked down on if you only come in to work and leave they want you to join the Canes Cult and it's terrible once you see outside of it.
I don't have any cons yet.
The manager would put me in for 40+ hours a week even though I was a full-time student. In addition, I had classes during the day but every week my manager would ""forget"" my availability even though I submitted it to them and they had to override the system in order to put me down for hours I was unable to work.
The pay wasn’t great, and they were very strict

Generally, it's still run like a university rather than a corporation (something that is sadly becoming increasingly rare in higher ed). That said, every department is different. The health and retirement benefits are great. In multiple positions, I was lucky to have supervisors who gave folks a lot of autonomy and treated us like adults.

The best part of working in this position was the flexible hours. It's perfect for someone who has an active life or wants and second job for extra cash.

","stressful situations and working over several locations around campus
I personally had a terrible experience. I worked in Technical Services at the William Pitt Union. My manager(who is still there) is a sociopath. He was consistently verbally abusive to me. He was out right confrontational with other members of staff and would do it with a grin because he liked it. He would create situations to stress out our students and turn to me and say ""This is kinda fun"". He lied in my performance review in an effort to get me fired. I caught him red handed deleting files to sabatoge me and reported him for this. This list of terrible experiences goes on. I went to HR on 3 separate occasions to report the crazyness I had been experiencing. HR did nothing. I think it got so bad that they nearly had a legal situation on their hands. The leadership amoung student affairs did nothing. I wasn't very high on the org chart so it must've been one of those ""no real person involved"" situations if you've seen succession. Eventually I was fired for the reasons my supervisor made up 8 months prior. While my unique story may not be common at Pitt.... it is well known within Pitt that HR is a joke. Acts that should be considered fireable offenses are often rewarded by promotions to get the idividual out of the current predicament they are in. I have actually heard of several stories of employees in research or other staff positions experiencing things similar to me, but nothing really gets done to solve the issue
No opportunity for advancement or salary increase other than nominal 2% cost of living annual increase. New person can make approximately the same amount as someone who has had the same position for several years.
The workload can be heavy and occasionally overwhelming, particularly during key research phases or during grant proposal seasons. Limited Compensation: As a research assistant, the salary might not reflect the level of work and hours required. Time Management Challenges: Balancing research responsibilities with academic coursework can be difficult and requires exceptional time management skills. Pressure: The environment can be highly competitive and demanding, leading to stress. Limited Job Security: Most positions are grant-funded, meaning there can be a lack of long-term job security.
After working here for over seven years, I do not see a positive outlook. Turnover is high across departments. Due to the multiple vacancies, managers are desperate to fill positions. However, existing employees are often too overworked to offer comprehensive training as they have to cover their own workload and that of the coworkers who left. New employees are often not told of the actual expectations/workload until they start the position. On a larger scale, there are promises of positive adjustments regarding pay inadequacies, but these lead to no actual change—just empty talk. Overall, the expectations do not match the level of pay. Turnover is high across departments, and people are rightfully leaving for other organizations where their time is better appreciated.
Pay is too low, growing trends of class system of faculty vs staff ( this was not the case ten years ago), increased costs of health insurances.
Pay stinks. Units are heavily siloed and are created seemingly at whim for vanity purposes. Units also often fail at communicating both between and among themselves. Educational benefits for oneself are great unless your position is so overworked that you can't take advantage of them. Unless you're faculty (and even it's rough), there's little room for advancement.
Pay is below average. With 6 years of experience, I still received below average pay.
The pay is below average for a university its size.
I have not have any cons
Not many opportunities for all doctoral students to work on campus
No possibility of significant raises or internal promotions. HR is glacial in both size and speed for updating market value compensation. Many other perks like Pitt childcare are inaccessible or useless.
Subpar leadership from PI, department, and school of medicine. No chance for advancement and the PI had absolutely no understanding of the role of a postdoc. Treated as a technician with no input about scientific projects. Constantly gaslit. PI tried to pit members of the lab against one another. No understanding of how to mentor postdocs or graduate students. No clear plan or directions for projects, career advancement, or grant writing. PI was more interested in applying for more patents than actually doing science. Paid less than what I should have given this was my second postdoc. PI started me at the incoming first-year level.
Silos. Some consistency but not totally consistent. Leads to
color winter, boring life, busy
Not many benefits, for instance no bonus
I wish the pay was higher but it's more than adequate.
Poor pay, but standard for line of work
interesting location don't like the city
Hiring process is slow & salary a little low in comparison to other fundraising positions.
there was little to no pay as a volunteer
Low pay Boring at times

Traffic is bad in Pittsburgh.
rainy and cloudy in summer, snow in winter
Pittsburgh is not well connected to the outside world (in terms of travel) Constant construction on campus
Low salary, terrible parking situation, office politics in certain departments, not many opportunities to advance
Tough to train in a high level environment, but worth it
Amount of work you need to do depends on the professor and on the term
Traffic is bad in Pittsburgh.
Underpaid. Claims to advance you to a permanent position after some time but I was there a year and wasn’t given the opportunity.
Budgets for student worker positions are stupidly limited - student workers are literally capped in terms of the wage they can earn, and it hasn't increased with inflation.
rainy and cloudy in summer, snow in winter
The pay is low, and you really have to fight for a raise. I'm very shy and always thought if I deserved to be promoted I would be. Over 17 years I've seen a lot of people with less experience and less degrees than me be promoted to better jobs just because they asked. The University recently did a reorganization of all their job titles and I was demoted. When I finally asked for at least a job title that reflected my seniority I was met with confusion and push back. This is why I'm leaving.

Pay is lower on the scale, and compared to the market value it is much lower. This is partly due to being an educational institution.
Absolutely no parking for employees. School has a wait list of multiple years, forced to find street parking around town and walk a mile to the office. I had my car broken into along with 10 other coworkers in just a years span.
Somewhat difficult to learn new techniques or advance
0 work-life balance At will of your PI
High expectations with little money for staff members.
Poor staff compensation Anti-union activities from institution Lack of leadership support
Very low pay for the area, few advancement opportunities without transferring
Campus is always under construction and theres no quiet places to sit

management would never get back to you on questions. constant turnover, uneven distribution of workloads. Training was barely there - they let you loose to manage millions and most of it was guess work.

Pitt will very often try to give job responsibilities 2-3 levels above your pay grade. Forget about trying to get the administration to acknowledge it in compensation. Salary compression for loyal employees is insane.
Definitely underpaid for my workload. Lots of turnover in the research offices, not a lot of great communication across the university.
Sometimes students cancel on you for tutoring
Lack of clear career path
Not happy with how they treat at promotions, no care or control on manager treatments with employees
Low pay, little career growth
High churn rate in the administration and lack of transparency, leading to a lot of paperwork problems.
There should be more careful choosing in the mentors hired in the program.
Salary is not competitive to market.
Horrible wages for students, only slightly better for permanent staff
Low pay, dealing with people who are there to get a paper published with little acknowledgement
Flexible hours- our department had very strict hours with no flex The pay is low
Long hours, weekends, no extra pay
Small city, small university, competitive
Top down approach. Lack of salary support for teaching and service.

Nothing it was a great experience.
- Could provide more direction - Delays in administrative tasks
Faculty attitudes and a lack of higher-level support in dealing with staff grievances Hard to get salary increases High turnover of staff
Low pay, little career growth
Takes a while to get interviews and then also to get hired. I think that the salaries are a little lower than median national. Pittsburgh has a lower Standard of Living but the salaries are low even with taking that into consideration.
High churn rate in the administration and lack of transparency, leading to a lot of paperwork problems.
lack of transparency, low salary, and poor pay raises
Generally, the University has limited upward mobility for current students.
A lot of people work there so finding the right person is tricky at first
Low pay, dealing with people who are there to get a paper published with little acknowledgement
Sometimes, workers need to walk outside in the sun and snow for many hours.
Administration can be annoying and bureaucratic from time to time. Parking near campus is difficult.
Campus is pretty spread out
Not scheduled all that much
Stressful at times, many busy days. The shifts fly by, though.
The pay is low, and there is no information presented on how one might progress to a supervisor position. I did not personally have major expectations as it was a part time position for me. I was able to work from home; had I needed to come into the office I probably would have opted for a different job.
Mental health, high work load
Some of the worst leadership I've ever encountered and I have worked in the service industry, so I feel like that really says something. Vice Chancellor of Facilities Management was one of the least competent people I've seen in charge. He lacks the ability to be honest, he completely lacks integrity, he placates people and tells them what he thinks they want to hear because he is so terrified of even the idea of confrontation. Most of the department acts like a boys club. I've heard the VC talk down about the few women who were in leadership positions, while giving raises to the men.

The best aspect of working at BAE we're my colleagues. Having a great team made all the difference day to day. Benefits were generally ok, plenty of PTO and holidays. Work from home opportunity was dependent on role but for me was occasionally available if needed. Many opportunities to learn new technologies while growing and refining existing skills. 9/80 schedule is fantastic. CEO appears to genuinely care about the organization overall.

Note that BAE Systems is a HUGE company, with many locations. I have some experience with other business areas within the Electronic Systems sector, but I mostly speak for the Endicott, NY facility. It's a great place for several reasons: - Work-life balance is highly respected. - Really tightly-knit community. - Super-flexible in terms of work at home, flex hours, etc. - No pidgeon-holing, and no discrimination. If you are willing to take on a challenge, you get to do it. Performance talks, not politics or old boy's clubs. - Easy to move around to different roles within the company if you need a change. - Good team vibes, people generally work together and help each other out. Outside of the facility, you'll enjoy plenty of options for quiet, rural living, great local schools to get your masters or PhD (Binghamton University and Cornell), and relatively low cost of living. Pretty good place for outdoor sports - mountain biking, hiking, skiing, kayaking, etc.
The people were all welcoming and helpful. The office space was comfortable as well.

There's freedom to move around in the company. Room to grow within the company structure here because they're still trying to integrate with the larger BAE systems policies and procedures. Once you get into a program and they learn what you bring to the table you can get overwhelmed with tasks and responsibilities really quickly.

The pay is on par with other companies in the area. But the way BAE uses their pay system will have you grossly under paid to your peers and junior members of your team. HR isn’t that bright which results is a mathematically flawed pay system.

If you are a self-starter looking to advance in a workplace. This is NOT a recommended job. Management has a major disconnect from the rest of the site. They will rarely even acknowledge your existence let alone interact with you. No matter how hard you work... Work ethic is destroyed here as you will receive the same respect and recognition as your coworker who puts in little to no effort each day. If anything, it will likely kickoff an uneven work distribution where you're carrying twice the workload as the 'Sr. Principal Engineer' making double your salary while playing on their phone each day. The salaries are subpar, ~10% less than competing tech companies in the area. Annual merit increases are 2.5%-3% each year. Promotions happen at standard rates every 4 years or so. Being a good employee with a powerful skillset and initiative makes no difference here. If you're looking for an easy paycheck where you can get by doing the bare minimum. This is your dream job.
- Facilities are mediocre at best. Unless you are a higher level manager, you will have a cube, and it will be small. Breakrooms are small, bathrooms are completely inadequate, there aren't enough of them, they are filthy, lots of broken sinks - PTO isn't great, 401(K) is just adequate - Feels like we are treated differently from the rest of ""Big"" BAE. Outsiders
Pay can be better for experience. Seems inconsistent.
Some sectors are not doing well compared to others.
So far, no Cons I can think of.
VERY high turnover rate (well over 50%). The technician are expected to learn multiple roles and become experts. The pay is not adjusted well to the area nor the extent of work provided by the employees.
Lack of meaniful work or programs. Lots of time spent on ""OVERHEAD""
- Large enough that bureaucracy can be a factor
More pay is always welcome
Pay might be a little lower than the market.
This biggest issue is a failure to win programs and loss of technical staff. While it may be a good place to start or end a career, always keep one foot out the door.
Can get political and nepotistic
When I last worked for BAE Systems in 2005. Our Drafting room has no windows 😕
Onboarding times were really long.
Healthcare is pricey. Interview process can be lengthy.
Like all companies, communication is subpar
No stock compensation for non-management.
Some people are a nightmare. There are a lot more people that rather do nothing or take forever to get something super simple done. Depending on your project you can have a ton of work and work tons of OT with out extra pay... or have absolutely nothing to do and you sit around.
Big company culture DoD Work with ever increasing regulatory burdens Little to no training available
Onboarding times were really long.
I was hired at BAE from out of state and told I had a job. Sold my house and moved. Right as my house is closing I'm told ""actually find something else as we don't know if this is your start date now but we'll let you know"". Then a month later it's ""You have one more interview. If you don't pass then you don't have a job."" This is despite me having an offer letter and moving across states and buying and selling a house. Finally I get a start date and leave my temporary job. When I get to the job it's not at all what the listing said (the listing is still being used so ask questions if you're applying for this position) or what the interview said. And the shift isn't what I was told either. ""Well I guess I'll make due. I'll work on getting my masters degree since they offer to pay for some of it"" I think. Except I can never reach my boss about it. Neither can my coworkers. You ask 3 questions that are important and only get one answered a week later. You find your bosses supervisor doesn't respond at all. Eventually I turned in my notice and essentially had to offboard myself. I've never seen a more disorganized company based on my experiences.
Good afternoon, Since my first day at BAE I have not been able to get a straight answer from HR or anyone I met with the day of orientation . My first day of orientation I have been excluded from my new hire group on many things. I was told I was not on the list of hires by every department. Since there was no record of me I was excluded from safety items, such as a flash light and hard hat. I was than told on my second day we will be meeting in same building and we would be introduced to our managers who would talk to us about our schedules, what we would be working on and how to clock in. I arrived at 7:10 on my second day at the training building with the other new hires and no one was there to great us. After waiting 30 minutes I walked to the 2002 building with the other new hires. After one of the other new hires asked what we needed to do, a man told us we can't weld without a respirator and we need to do a OSHA safety class. He than looked at me and asked "" are you supposed to be here?"". I responded ""I'm a welder"". The man than said I don't have you on my list. I said to him"" I was hired with the others. I just haven't been given a helmet yet"". I was then given a helmet with what looked like was previously puked in. I was than told I'll have to wait for a manager because I can't weld until I've gotten a respirator. While I waited for a manager I asked where do I go to get PPE because I was told the day before the company will supply it. I was pointed to the tool shop and asked for Weld sleeves a mask and a helmet. I was told they are out of sleeves and they don't give out weld helmets there. Since it is so hot an humid its not wise to weld in a full weld jacket. it's all they had and since I was told not to bring my equipment from home I took what I could get. The tool shop lady than told me I could get a helmet from Airgas down the road. Once I got to Airgas they told me I would have to pay for a new one. I told them I was told by tool shop to go to you. The cashier at Airgas said no and to go back. I told the tool shop what Airgas told me and they finally gave me a welding helmet to put on my hardhat. Why they wouldn't give it to me the first time,idk? That's been my experience for the past two days so I moved on. Once 12 rolled around there was still no manager and still I had no answers. I didn't know when I would start second shift or even if I was supposed to be there. I've felt like the lack of communication was so bad it was dangerous. If got hurt I didn't feel confident that the people around me would able to communicate to each other an help. I also felt discriminated against and left out of the entire onboarding process. I never got a hard hat, never shown how to access my time card, never shown how to punch in, never told where to fill up my water.... The list goes on. I've been a working professional for 14 years an I've never been treated so poorly. The way each person in every department has treated me shows me ethics and safety are a big issue at BAE.
Healthcare is pricey. Interview process can be lengthy.
Like all companies, communication is subpar
many of the wrong people are retained
No cafeteria provided on site.
No stock compensation for non-management.
Big company culture DoD Work with ever increasing regulatory burdens Little to no training available
Market rates (pay) consistently behind the rest of the market and other companies. Employees should not have to try and take an opportunity elsewhere to receive a pay rate that matches their worth. Major communication issues abound with upper/senior managment . Upper/senior managment seemed to not acknowledge when processes/procedures break down at their level. Changes to processes, procedures, software and hardware needs to happen much quicker for the IT portion of the company. Process for being cleared to various programs broken, difficult, and takes far too long.
Understaffed leaving a lot on everyone’s plate with little motivation from management to address
Open offices are the worst Difficult to find programs needing staff--as of 2023, they don't have enough work available and I don't recommend them as an employer. They overhired and couldn't win the contracts to support people. 64 people were just laid off. Lots of white guys with regressive attitudes
You should be able to get the same thing as a normal one
Poor management practices Processes need improvement
Little effect on your current position once program has been completed.
Bad 401, at the mercy of contracting
Leadership is scrambled and there are always more questions than answers
A lot of turn over with management and lower level employees. Frequently short staffed so you get an increased workload but with no additional compensation
No remote ability, very political for career progression
PTO left much to be desired for this industry compared to its competitors.
They don't pay as competitively when it comes to their long standing staff which has made a lot of teams turn into a revolving door for people.
Just another body. No real connection attempted between leadership and employees
Heavily regulated industry resulting in reduced innovation.
Need improvement in organization and leadership
None I can think of
There was a big turnover, not just employees leaving, but also employees moving to other positions in the company and sometimes when that happened, the employees left behind had to pick up the slack. That could be overwhelming.
There are no downsides to working at BAE
They brag about how they're one of the top employers in the state for job satisfaction, but I saw some very high turnaround. While they do a great job and onboarding and making you feel welcome, the work can be extremely boring. On top of that, software/clearance access can take months, which means you might not be able to do anything for at least 3 months after joining. I felt the work itself was meaningless. I ""reviewed"" documents, and put notes into a folder. I asked why, and I was told that my notes would be helpful for the next reviewer. I still feel this accomplished nothing, and was a waste of tax dollars. Non-engineers seemed to love it, but no engineers stayed around for more that a year or two.

Like every company normal politics
Taxes are real high for what you get in the area. Fortunately houses are cheap compared to many places, and you can pretty easily live across the border in PA to get much lower property taxes. Salaries are lower than urban areas, in line with the lower cost of living around here. There are some pros to being part of a massive corporation - financial stability is a big one. But it also means that there can be a lot of red tape and regulations. There's a bit of a college-age scene downtown, but it's definitely not a big-city cultural experience. I should note there are also have facilities in Ft Wayne Indiana and Austin Tx which have the same work culture, same management structure, but let you live somewhere else if you want.
Difficult to get in touch with coworkers occasionally as the company is still returning to work
(Good food, but generic and artificial ingredients that can be damaging to your health, definitely pack your own food if you want to eat right). Sometimes co-workers are friendly and interesting, others are petty and jealous, complaining of minor things like going out for pizza slices at the square, etc. Supervisor looked past a more favored employee who was allowed to run free in an RF/Microwave lab damaging what we estimated to be well over $250,000 of our prized cal-kits, adapters, filters, splitters, mixers, bridges, cables, etc…then tried to include me as a culprit, even though I’m the guy who originally arranged for the connector care training session, on site from the Engineering team of a vendor…which had to include us all to not single this person out. Realizing that it wasn’t what you knew, but who you knew, I lost interest and knew then it was not my company to work with and I was powerless and without a voice, even of legitimate concern for our collective good.
Interns did not get paid outstandingly and they did not pay for housing
They are a big company, so you are just another cog in the wheel. I was there several years and the benefits (health insurance, retirement system) got progressively worse/more expensive annually.
Nothing specific about the work or culture
Employee Portal is a little outdated
no time off, no time to spend with family
There's a large gap in age in the company. Lots of folks 50 and above who have been working there for 30+ years, and then a wave of new hires ~30 years and younger. It can be difficult to navigate through the personalities of those who are firmly entrenched into the company culture.
Old tech, very process oriented, needs to be shaken up for sure.
Very conservative and regimented decision structure.
Lack of support from management, poor onboarding process, little career progression
Long hours and lack of care for employees
All but 3 of my checks have been wrong,

Poor pay depending on your location. In my area the competition pays roughly 20% - 30% higher salaries, and offers significantly better education benefits. Senior leadership knows, as this is an issue that is consistently brought up during company-wide meetings, but doesn’t seem to care.
-Nepotism -Obsessed with DE&I (Not a good look for a defense company) - “Young Professionals” group - They lump in Veterans with the DE& I folks, LGBT , most Veterans want no part in this. - Upper Management out of touch - Stripping away all the great benefits the company once offered. - Good Engineers offer solutions to common and costly problems, but implementation is optional and often ignored.
Difficult to get in touch with coworkers occasionally as the company is still returning to work
(Good food, but generic and artificial ingredients that can be damaging to your health, definitely pack your own food if you want to eat right). Sometimes co-workers are friendly and interesting, others are petty and jealous, complaining of minor things like going out for pizza slices at the square, etc. Supervisor looked past a more favored employee who was allowed to run free in an RF/Microwave lab damaging what we estimated to be well over $250,000 of our prized cal-kits, adapters, filters, splitters, mixers, bridges, cables, etc…then tried to include me as a culprit, even though I’m the guy who originally arranged for the connector care training session, on site from the Engineering team of a vendor…which had to include us all to not single this person out. Realizing that it wasn’t what you knew, but who you knew, I lost interest and knew then it was not my company to work with and I was powerless and without a voice, even of legitimate concern for our collective good.
Interns did not get paid outstandingly and they did not pay for housing
BAE has a pay scale that goes 9, 10, 11, 12 etc….. Titles translate into pay ENG II = 9, ENG SR = 10, ENG PRINCIPAL = 11, etc…. However, they will only hire you at 90% of the middle of the pay scale, then ever year they will add to the scale to stay competitive, but your pay will only increase by the same percentage leaving you losing ground in your pay grade with every passing year. There is absolutely no way to progress in your own pay grade, you need to go find another job within the company to make more than the person they just hired from outside, however then you are now the outside person coming in to a new group making more than those already there, so everyone constantly feels under appreciated. If you stay in your position too long the new hires and those who you have trained and got promoted end up making far more than 10 year seasoned experienced employees. When you bring this up to your manager, they will only “try” to see if they can get your pay equal to that kid they just hired, but nothing ever happens. I’m a SR and doing the exactly same job as a SR PRINCIPAL with the exact same job description, roles and responsibilities but make $35k a year less than my counterpart. They take advantage of your age saying “you’re too old to leave now” I ran a project on one vehicle that saved the company $4.6 million per year in production costs, they wouldn’t give me a raise or promotion to get within $15k per year of my counterpart, but they did give me $250 “Impact award” gift card to make them feel better about all my work. The following year I saved the company $6 million in waste on a different vehicle platform and still didn’t get a raise or promotion, just got a $800 “Impact award” So……….. if you like being over worked, and under paid in comparison to the sloths around you, this is the place for you.
Can not bike to work
limited growth in current climate
Not a lot of movement opportunities
The commute is the worst thing for me.
Lack of support from management, poor onboarding process, little career progression
Long hours and lack of care for employees
Narrow minded when it comes to remote work
All but 3 of my checks have been wrong,
Special treatment given to some while others have to pick up the slack. Company shows positive financials followed by layoffs. Sometimes feels like you need to be available 24/7
Morale is low Low pay
HR and ethics care only as much as they legally need to. The good of the employee is outweighed by the profit to the company. Health insurance is truly terrible
Poor pay depending on your location. In my area the competition pays roughly 20% - 30% higher salaries, and offers significantly better education benefits. Senior leadership knows, as this is an issue that is consistently brought up during company-wide meetings, but doesn’t seem to care.

Great people and the graduates are great mentors to talk to about future ideas
","The pay is not the best
The pay is just okay for part-time work. It used to be a bragging point that the campus minimum was $10/hr, but now its less appealing that I could get paid more working fast food. Administration is rather greedy with how they pay their employees. They definitely need to pay their graduate students more considering it isn't even a livable wage for Bloomington. They do everything they can to ignore the graduate student union. Its ridiculous if you consider the administration's and sport team coach's salaries. In my department there are plenty of vacant labs because the university won't hire anyone after they retire or left due to covid. The department hasn't seen that extra money from it though.
- No salary negotiation - Paid me less than my male counterpart for the same job
IU leadership is the worst it's ever been. Current leadership has forced many great people out of IU. Lots of people fired for no good reason. Lots of shady things happening at higher levels and the culture wasn't great before but it is worse than ever. Leadership doesn't know how to utilize stats and push their own personal agendas instead. It's difficult to move up in the organization unless you listen and follow leadership orders. They do not want people who can critically think. The support arm of UITS is the worst it's ever been. Most folks are over worked and underpaid as IU seems to shift in further into the depths of a culture characterized by fear and forced alignment of theory x management. Tons of money wasted on both indecision and poor decision moments. At times it feels leadership thinks IU is a for profit institution with staffing, training, etc. to align.
None come to mind, it was perfect for me personally.
Wage is fair, provide support to the students
Pay is low compared to other similar jobs
non-tenure track faculty are an after thought
The company culture is not great, departments don't always work together, and there is zero work/life balance
I have nothing to report.

IU itself is a difficult organization to work for, especially as a student. You are capped at 29 hours per two weeks so they don't have to allot you any benefits, parking is difficult, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of respect for student workers from the administrative side.

They should pay better. And they should not union bust
Work life balance can be a struggle and the leadership seems to be to busy to fully support me!
Depends on the professor working with.
Most PI's are not able to pay very much
Undervalued, overworked, poor pay, unfair pay/conflicting pay “policies” for new employee experience vs long time employees
The university is unable to pay more than $10/hr to current undergrads and $12/hr to grads or graduate students.
Sometimes you find it boring.
no downsides as such that i have faced except a little low pay
They do not correct bad behavior, especially in management positions. Bare minimum for their employees. Very hard to get basic needs met. No one is very friendly so you basically have to figure everything out on your own.
Incompetent managers and tough hours.
Indiana University is uncoordinated and slow to prioritize the needs of its student workers at times. They made a mistake with my payrate the first school-year I worked here, and took a while to fix the error when it when realized.
Management does not always prepare staff effectively, however is receptive to change.
the position is not remote
They should pay better. And they should not union bust

None to be honest. Pay cycles are on time and everyone is so helpful
Most PI's are not able to pay very much
Important who you work with Some positions have low chance for advancement, so know where you want/can go before you start
Location can be a bit remote from bigger cities. Bloomington get empty during the summer.
sometimes work can get hard
Some time commitment if you are an assistant for a lecture, but still valuable.
Low pay for the amount of hours worked
pretty stagnant you’re allowed to do certain things and that’s all
If you don't like working with kids or being in the water this job is definitely not for you.
None besides price of tuition
Pay is not competitive for entry and lower level positions
A little confusing to navigate
Management does not always prepare staff effectively, however is receptive to change.
Management is not often supportive. Job training is not always provided, leaving too much room for confusion and error in situations where errors can be devastating to a student's education. Inter-office politics are a mess. Salaries for offices serving the highest number of new undergraduate students are laughable.
tough hours with stressful workloads
There are no such cons
Incompetent managers and tough hours.
depends on the class you are teaching, your workload can be difficult for a part time gig
Abysmal treatment of graduate student employees, refusal to negotiate better pay conditions and health care. Even well-meaning departments have practically zero ability to effect substantive improvements.
lack of flexibility with class times, low pay
Pay could definitely be better
-Have to deal with parents -Poor management at certain locations
- Low salary - Can be time consuming
Low pay for level of responsibility
Should have even more curious and interesting colleagues
Time working and amount of pay.
This job has no cons.
Nothing much. It can take up to 20 hrs each week
-Depends on the hall that you get.
At times it is difficult to balance the different stats softwares clients require. You never know which software you are going to get!
New administrative leaders cutting budget. IU legal counsel has retaliated against faculty on free speech issues so no trust in them.
you pretty much work for free. impossible to move up.
Low pay for the amount of hours worked
Labor intensive work and monotomous.

*minimal human interaction most of the time
a simple and easy job, hourly pay is ok at that time.
During Peak (christmas season) and Prime week (June) Amazon will provide employees with meals on occasion. This is particularly nice when dinner is provided after a 12-13 hour shift.
Ability to get done early if you're fast. Ability to make extra money if you help rescue another DA (delivery associate aka driver). Steady schedule. Bonus money if you're team reaches ""fantastic plus"" status. Good workout for the first 2-3 months.
Good opportunity if you work for a well organized manager. Independent - can listen to music or podcasts while you work. Can work as fast as you want - if you're manager is cool with it, they'll pay you for a 10 hour shift even if it only takes 6 hours to do your route.

The fact that I am not only an Amazon customer I was also employed within Amazon Flex. They have deactivated my account due to my purse with all my belongings in it was stolen from store cart while I was shopping. Because of my Driver's license and phone being in my purse I was not able to contact Amazon Flex to cancel shift and or forfeit shifts due to no access to phone until the week of May 15, 2023. I could not even enjoy my mother's day with my 4 Children because of the lost and because of Amazon flex I now can not work because the company dose not show Empathy and or sympathy for Single Black Mother's. The fact no one has called to check on me and my kids health is beyond distasteful, I suffer from multiple mental illness and which I am seeking help for and the company can careless what happens to our health when thing as such take affect.

They will pay you in a few days. And also sometimes they pay you full for smaller routes.
Easy to get hired for income
the coworkers are a plus and flex allows me to attend to other matters in my life
","sometimes you have to drive far distances
*Unrealistic expectations (cannot deliver the number of packages in the allotted time) *Mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting (every shift pushes you to human limits) *Other drivers on the road, random people, and some customers range from rude to out-of-control/psychotic towards you knowing you work for Amazon and when you are doing precisely what you are trained to do (A semi-truck tried to run me off the road multiple times, people will scream at you, etc) *The Flex app is so ridiculous and inaccurate that you will have to perform U-turns after every stop because it will tell you the wrong way to go. *Micromanaging turns good drivers into hazards due to too many rules
too many workers didn't work quickly, slow pace job.
There's no reward for long-term DSP drivers. The average driver only receives a pay increase when the hiring wage is increased. The only way to bump your pay is to promote to a supervisory/lead position, which is limited. Also, the routing order is questionable at times.
Extremely fast paced environment if you are assigned a brutal route. Fast paced brutal route: No time to eat lunch (only snack as you drive) or find a restroom to stop at (pee in a bottle). The Amazon partner you work for (DSP) may care about your well-being, but Amazon doesn't give a SH** about you or any issues or health concerns that you may have. Amazon has developed a system that draws a younger audience in and burn you to the ground within months time. Not years, but months. Holidays and Prime time to deliver is a nightmare. Unless you enjoy delivering 400-500 packages to 190 stops (not including actual places within each stop) with only 8 hours, give or take, to complete the route. If you bring packages back to the station from running out of drive time (running into OT hours) then you're considered out of compliance and only have a few chances to prove yourself. The city of Seattle was my area. So if you like speed walking/running half marathons every day, you love 45 degree angle hills and find pleasure in striding on cobble stone for 8 hours a day, then place this sentence in the pros box and good for you.
If you finish your route (your only responsibility) early, you may be required to go and save other drivers that are falling behind.
No UPT/Management need to improve
get competitive when it comes to choosing your own time.
Not enough shifts $0.80 raise a year
Stocking boxing no problem car ride everything else
The hardest part is finding the apartment number and witch building to bring it to, because I’m from Louisiana I just moved here so I had to get used of everything
Some of the routes is really long
Too much mocromagment sallary okay
Have to wait right before the block begins to select it if you want a better pay rate.
Amazon doesn’t give a crap about a driver’s safety at all especially in their own warehouse parking lot. They don’t care about a driver’s health, opinion, thoughts or feelings. Have no problem giving you routes to the most crime infested neighborhoods in Baltimore City. The people who create the routes are absolutely clueless. (routes are often inefficient). The driver support staff are absolutely clueless. A LOT of the customers are absolutely clueless & lazy. Your ratings will take a hit if dishonest customers lie and say that didn’t receive their package or porch pirates steal the package. You will often return packages to the station on your own time for free.
The heat is dangerous to work in.
Sometimes deliveries to apartments take up time
Managers are not great, no room for growth.
-Shifts can easily go over 10 hours -Was not uncommon to deliver 400+ packages with other 180+ stops
Better pay for work, at least an incentive.
> High turn-around, very intro level. > Paid training > Competitive intro pay, great for early careers. > Perfect stepping-stone for a career revitalization > Aging welders and assembly personnel are given an equal opportunity. (FOR REAL: Unlike many other companies)
The gas lost and or prices, the Milage driven should be compensated for reimbursement of oil changes and gas amounts has risen
The heat is dangerous to work in.
There’s less and less increase in rate for routes. I used to get $60 or more for a 2 hr route.
Sometimes deliveries to apartments take up time
The workload is ridiculous for most
You pay for you own gas, shifts are inconsistent in distance, number of packages per route, pay, etc. I once got paid 60 bucks to deliver one package, but it took a half tank of gas to get there.
-Shifts can easily go over 10 hours -Was not uncommon to deliver 400+ packages with other 180+ stops
Better pay for work, at least an incentive.
Great company to work for
Not a lot of rest and constantly having to move with less breaks
You have no control over where you deliver. Cost of gas, maintenance, time does not equate the low base pay
The weather was bad at times
they have a lot of metrics which can be difficult
It can get frustrating at times when can’t a delivery
Main con is that there is long hours
Support mostly always sides with the customer even though you are a customer yourself They expect you never to deliver a package late as if you can fly You must always and I mean always contact support if you are going to be late if you cannot deliver a package if you cannot get to the destination .. or they will lower your level status Sometimes you cannot click the option for"" I am in the correct area.. GPS is not working"" then you have to call or chat with support which takes up more time I would say between ( 5 to 15 minutes or more )
Not all shifts pay well.
Base pay is horrible. Amazon doesn’t take into account gas and mileage that you are putting on your car. The only way Amazon delivery shifts are worth it is if you’re doing surge shifts
The Schedule Shifts Employees (grown people not know how too speak) This isn't a full time or a part time it's a part time in disguise of ""temp work"" expect they call its ""flex""
You pay for you own gas, shifts are inconsistent in distance, number of packages per route, pay, etc. I once got paid 60 bucks to deliver one package, but it took a half tank of gas to get there.
None yet, everything is good.
There are no other benefits, other than the flexibility. Also, it can be hard to get shifts. With sales going down, they don't have as much of a variety in shift times as they used to. There are a lot of people who work flex and are fighting for the same shifts. They get taken in seconds. Not a job that provides a reliable income.
Scheduling shifts is annoying Pickup site is chaotic when busy
You have no control over where you deliver. Cost of gas, maintenance, time does not equate the low base pay
sometimes its a lot of driving
On road drama Missed packages
Work is currently limited to 1 block at most a day 90% of the time. Limiting its earning max substantially. This is not something you can do full-time anymore at least in Champaign. Pay often doesn't exceed millage.
The work is boring and the days are long.
they have a lot of metrics which can be difficult
Main con is that there is long hours
Hard hours and very hot in Arizona
Support mostly always sides with the customer even though you are a customer yourself They expect you never to deliver a package late as if you can fly You must always and I mean always contact support if you are going to be late if you cannot deliver a package if you cannot get to the destination .. or they will lower your level status Sometimes you cannot click the option for"" I am in the correct area.. GPS is not working"" then you have to call or chat with support which takes up more time I would say between ( 5 to 15 minutes or more )
Sometimes it can be more packages then it should be/ dogs
Market is saturated. Hard to get anything over base routes. You can be sent over an hour away for a 2hr block. You never know what you are going to encounter.
you have to be on your own
Base pay is horrible. Amazon doesn’t take into account gas and mileage that you are putting on your car. The only way Amazon delivery shifts are worth it is if you’re doing surge shifts
The Schedule Shifts Employees (grown people not know how too speak) This isn't a full time or a part time it's a part time in disguise of ""temp work"" expect they call its ""flex""
The don't pay on weekends
I worked there for over 3 years. but then corruption began at the Prime2 station (UORL), I suspect that the Amazon Flex support service is involved in this. Through a special application, they receive a bribe, after which the driver is sent blocks of an insta offer with a route. If you are an ordinary driver and do not pay, then you can sit at the station all day with the mode turned on is available now. But you won't get an insta offer. I noticed this and saw that a group of drivers appeared (mostly Cubans) who receive insta offers regularly, every day for 4-6 blocks. I started writing to the support service and adding photos and videos. But soon it was blocked.
Not enough trips available too many drivers at one spot
Beating the bots requires super human patience and lots of luck
Scheduling shifts is annoying Pickup site is chaotic when busy
too many stops, heavy boxes, broken devices
WORK IN EXTREME WEATHER, RUSH YOU, NO TIME FOR BREAK
Delivering early in the morning Delivering at night Delivering in Downtown Use a lot of Gas for little pay unless its peak season
Not being able to work when you actually want to.
They send you out to the middle of no where where this is little to no cell service and it sucks because you need good cell service to be able to submit the delivery. They also lowered their pay. Convenient if you have a small 4-cyl car if not, don’t bother.
While driving as a flex driver, the routes can get quite tedious for the amount of money paid. It gets annoying when you can't deliver a package, and the distribution centers closes, so you have to hold the package(s) until the next day, and deliver it back to the distribution center by a deadline for no extra pay
sometimes its a lot of driving
Didnt have anything bad but just little to much on call
sometimes there are only night shifts available, now shifts are posted same day so you can't plan ahead
Not a lot of money
The specific DSP I worked under did not allow bathroom breaks (For women), I personally was hurt my first day on route and got told to deal with it (I am still dealing with it many months after leaving)
Lack of shifts some weeks. Cold conditions
the work is incredibly boring
Delivering to apartment in downtown is very hard. Sometime have to travel 50-60 miles away to deliver packages. Very hard to find food blocks, they disappear in seconds.
A bit repetitive in some instances
low pay high mileage routes not ready on time problems with the flex app gps and loading punishment for flat tires or car trouble that causes you not to finish your route
A lot of work here
Getting shifts is a pain
during the pandemic, the staff initially did very little to keep us safe. many workers who had covid were still working and unfortunately, I caught covid at the site. In which I left the job soon after. Though I assume things have been resolved since I left in 2020
Delivering in tall buildings is really going annoy you.
The don't pay on weekends
Literally everything. You get a 30 min break but then that puts you behind a half hour. Minimum 20 stops per hour so just hope gps is telling you where to go correctly. Delivering at night you can’t see because of the motion lights in the back. Only two rescues a week. So just pray nothing goes wrong. Amazon says door to door but in apartments they have mailrooms. But customers notes say to door. You listen to the customer but your dsp is telling you to just deliver to mailroom getting you to go against customers. Saying you have 170 stops but grouping stops together that are close only counting as one stop. So you really end up having 200 but the time frame doesn’t reflect it. And be ready to RUN unsafely to deliver packages on time.
The work and balance is not that great
Some blocks have low pay and high volume.
required to work in harsh weather. conditions
Sporadic schedule was kinda difficult
Many, many things are wrong
Not being able to work when you actually want to.
No call No show No job no mo!
You have to catch shifts on the app. There are weekly caps for the amount of hours you work.
They send you out to the middle of no where where this is little to no cell service and it sucks because you need good cell service to be able to submit the delivery. They also lowered their pay. Convenient if you have a small 4-cyl car if not, don’t bother.

It gets annoying when you can't deliver a package, and the distribution centers closes, so you have to hold the package(s) until the next day, and deliver it back to the distribution center by a deadline for no extra pay
Low pay overworked poor work equipment
Lots of miles on your car
Not good as your primary Job. There are not many jobs available sometimes and most of your time is spent sitting in parking lot waiting for a delivery route to become available.
Extremely long hours, and unpredictable schedules
the job can be boring

Fairly good work life balance Collaboration and working with engineering, some really smart people. Plenty of opportunity to learn new things.
Superficial benefits like free lunch(which I am sure will go away soon)
Financial compensation is on par with the market. Lots of superficial perks like free lunch (until they take that away) Company is doing well during a down economy.
wonderfull company to work.encourages innovation
Nice office, good food, smart colleagues
Decent pay, good benefits, nice campus
MathWorks values home/life balance with their hybrid model and general attitude for not expecting employees to take work home with them. The company has a forward-looking approach on helping not only their customers but their employees as well. The hybrid model is well implemented with set common days to be on campus to maximize collaborative effort when working in person which helps build stronger connections within teams. New employees will often being in the Engineering Development Group (EDG, depending on the role they applied for) during which employees gather useful information about the company and are able to explore the many areas of focus the company offers. MathWorks also offers strong perks for their MathWorkers from breakfast/lunch, individual office spaces, a gym with various fitness classes, valuable training courses, health and well being resources, and more.
Good culture, work/life balance , process driven, continuous improvement mentality, free breakfast and lunch every day , really good coworkers!

Good work and life balance.
The company takes care of it's interns by checking in with them regularly. The company culture is similar to a college campus (people play frisbee, arcade games, or work out in their free time). My coworkers and mentors were supportive, kind, and contributed greatly to my development. The company is currently providing breakfast and lunch to all of it's employees and the food is great. For recent grads, there is a two year program where the new hires can explore different teams and join the one that is the best fit for their experiences and interests.
Good work-life balance and company culture
Very nice place to work.
Great benefits, lovely colleagues, intelligent people and genuinely interested in your wellbeing
Great Team to work with.
Free food; Free peanuts; Full of slackers with few hard workers who run the ship
Supportive colleagues, good work-life balance, fair compensation, option to work from home 3 days/week, and lots of little perks (free food and coffee, museum discounts, gym access, etc.)
This is a company that fully supports it's staff members. Ideas are valued regardless of seniority, the CEO is more thansparent than any I've worked for, and I enjoy learning about the impact that our products have on science and engineering daily. The campus is immaculate, every staff member has their own closed-door office, breakfast and lunch are free (and amazing), our corporate culture is strong and I look forward to coming to the office 2x a week.

Great people Impactful work Ability to try new things
Stable and smooth in general. No hype and also no layoffs and such
Culture is relatively laid back in most groups Nice office and perks Outside of Boston so you are against rush hour traffic New hybrid culture is good Company trips and meetings are good
I love MathWorks. The work that I do is impactful in that I get to assist engineers using MATLAB and Simulink all around the world to push the bounds of science and develop new innovations. The work life balance is amazing. 5:30 comes around and everyone goes home. I had a manager say ""please don't stay after to submit to the code base"" when I was behind on a submission. There is free food, free gym, BBQ every Thursday during the summer, and everyone is super nice and helpful. There's also unlimited sick time. Would highly recommend MathWorks!

Fantastic culture, great leadership, thoughtful/long-term planning. Staff members are most important. Fun, vibrant environment. Brilliant scientists and engineers focused on pursuit of excellence. Big focus on learning and self improvement. Integrity, credibility. Most important philosophy: Do The Right Thing.
Company continues to innovate with 30+ new products in the past 5 years. Many growth areas such as robotics, AI, wireless, and automated driving. Continuous company growth drives career growth. Management is long-term focused and makes rational decisions. Product strategy is done at IC level (where the knowledge is) rather than by senior managers. Private offices, free lunch/gym, hybrid work schedule.

","We want to make sure the tools are built correctly, which can lead to a slower pace to development.
None I can think of
1. Limited Opportunities for Advancement: One significant drawback at MathWorks is the difficulty in moving up the corporate ladder. Advancement to managerial positions appears to be heavily dependent on factors beyond an individual's control, which can be frustrating for ambitious employees keen to take on more responsibility. 2. Slow Career Progression in Engineering: While dedication and contributions are recognized, the timeline for career progression, especially in engineering roles, seems unduly lengthy. Waiting 5-6 years for evaluation and advancement decisions can lead to a sense of stagnation among highly motivated individuals. 3. Communication and Leadership Style: The communication approach and leadership style, particularly from the older CEO, can sometimes raise concerns. The recent email promoting in-office work without substantial data-driven reasoning might have been better received with a more inclusive and transparent tone. As it appears, the company is rolling back the work-from-home option and is gradually forcing everyone to come back to the office full-time.
Company is frequently making policy changes because ""others are doing it"" and not with any legitimate justifications. Vocal disagreements and asking for data-driven decisions are ignored. There also has been a much stronger push towards making and rejecting decisions based purely on how much money it will make, and not on how much we could be helping our customers.
If you desire is to be somewhere other than Massachusetts for the long term.
1) Lack of appreciation or recognition when working overtime, even though work-life balance is lost. 2) Lacks external or cross-team interaction due to which you are only limited to connecting within your project team.
Too rigid, too much process. Not agile enough Too quick to jump to hi-fidelity designs, need more design exploration In person work policy is going back to pre-covid days. Not forward thinking Lack of trust in ICs Limited growth - lots of dinosaurs who aren't going anywhere
You will never know when the policies will change. Worst company with respect to immigration assistance. Not at all flexible to accommodate visa issues. Every decision is department specific and never can be generalized for the company; basically would feel like a MathWorks 2.0 in some departments. MNC just for the name!
Technical complexity: MathWorks' software solutions are powerful and comprehensive, but they can also have a steep learning curve. As a Sales Representative, you may need to invest time and effort in understanding the technical aspects of the products to effectively communicate their value to potential customers.
None that I can think of.
Work-Life balance can be difficult at times Many meetings

REQUIRED to be in the office three days per week. Management will walk around to make sure you are there. Flexibility is nonexistent. Company really values the developers. All other employees are secondary and little room for growth for those employees. The yearly review process lasts from February through May and takes more time than its worth.
: MathWorks typically offers competitive salary packages and benefits to attract and retain top talent.
The fish rots from the head down.
Despite the 'core values', many recent changes have been made that employees have expressed displeasure with but never received the logic behind and more than generic buzzwords.
If entering the company through EDG, employees will need to work in Tech Support before starting their official role which can be challenging if seeking a role that is not customer-facing or if Tech Support is not your forte.
Flat hierarchy, too many processes
- Salary is not spectacular - Build tech is get quite old. Need a new mindset to building a complex software.
Bad location and can be boring
Can’t think of cons except trying to increase salary
Can be a little slow at times; however, there are always projects that can be taken up during slow periods.
-You do have to live nearby, since they want you to come in twice a week. Not true remote (but you can work remotely temporarily depending on your situation or if something comes up) -You have to be married to your partner to share the company health insurance- can't do parents or domestic partners. Only spouses and kids -promotions are slow and mainly based on time, rather than true ability. -onboarding is super overloaded and doesn't cover the most relevant information. much of it is actually wrong in some cases. but teams are understanding about you not really learning anything during the official trainings/onboarding - actual vacation time is meh, not bad, just meh. you do get 3 days of ""personal time"" though.
* Pay is great if you stay long enough * Initial pay may not be same as other public companies like google but at the same time we don't have to worry about layoffs
kind of slow paced, if you are early in career you might want to advance faster
HR is not friendly and they need more training
None that I can think of
- Pay is not up to par for Boston
No real downsides to call out
kind of slow paced, if you are early in career you might want to advance faster
Not the best for everyone
HR is not friendly and they need more training
None that I can think of
No real downsides to call out
Not much mobility because turnover is small
Low pay compared to other similar companies
lots of toxic politics. You will come home feeling horrible. Many development managers have insufficient people skills.
Less competitive pay compared to other companies
I don't have any cons I can think of
Low to average pay Slow growth
I do not see a Con as of now.
Tedious workflow. Might be hard to make progress.
Full time employees have told me the first few months of employment can be stressful because they have to toggle between technical support and projects every two weeks. Full-timers are ""scored"" by their managers in order to determine bonuses, which is not a lot; I've been told that MathWork loses a lot of talent because it doesn't offer incentivizing stock options like it's competitors and the annual bonus really only keeps up with inflation.
System is getting obsolete compared with other companies
No remote positions available at the moment.
Lots of bureaucratic processes, and slow moving.
Slow Management to work with.
No differentiation between hardworker vs slacker - all you get is peanuts no matter what.
It's very difficult to think of a con
Hard to find a drawback worth mentioning. Changes to processes can be lengthy and require a lot of input from others which can be seen as a con if you come from faster-paced workplaces. It's an adjustment I had to make upon joining but now I value the slower pace/review before implementing any process change.
Must love Math Lack of international travel opportunities
Low pay compared to other similar companies
lots of toxic politics. You will come home feeling horrible. Many development managers have insufficient people skills.
Management undervalues improvements outside of planned work.
- Politics exists! - Not a lot of scope for progress
Compensation could be 10% below market but gets balanced through various other benefits.
I have nothing negative to say
None so far, it is exactly the job I wanted.
* If you want hands-on work, this won't be the place for you.

Base salary is lower than comparable roles elsewhere.
Compensation is not very competitive
none to share at this moment
Nothing major at the moment
Slow to move up Pays slightly lower than industry avg.
So groups can be very intense because of the many foreigners.
Culture has degraded over the years, hiring has been questionable at times Opportunities for growth limited Pay is really low compared to competitors No stock & bonuses really low Management is poor, direction is lacking a lot of times Biggest Con: Non-standard industry tools/skills non-transferrable
Nothing at all to share!
Thorough decision processes are time-consuming
Focus on using internal tools Reliance on using dated third party tools like reviewboard (!?) and perforce
Slow growth slow promotions No stocks
Bureaucracy makes it hard to get things done quickly and efficiently. Oftentimes needing to many people to review changes that can be done quickly
The pay is seriously not enough to live a middle class lifestyle in the new england area. Don't expect to be able to afford to purchase a house.
there is nothing negative to mention about the company
Other than the well discussed cons of working as an EDG engineer - low salary and non technical sales tasks not worth of new grads with an engineering degree, I was lured into accepting the offer being told that I would get to work with ""Machine learning "" teams and follow my interests. DO NOT JOIN if you want are interested in pursuing anything ML related at mathworks US. Their ML tech leads are ancient just like their projects and toolboxes. They cannot afford to hire or retain and decent ML talent and there is no one to learn from or lead here. Outdated toolboxes and non technical customers account for terrible EDG projects . The entire EDG program wastes 50 percent of the new grads time in sales work and the high attrition rate in EDG reflects this. Do not join mathworks Natick if you are interested in a ML or Deep learning and in general avoid EDG if you do not want to be pushed into quality and testing work like most of the EDG 'ers.
No significant cons over here
Slow to change Pay Time off
I can't think of a single con.
Consensus-driven decision making is not for everyone. Need to be willing to debate pros and cons, then live with the decision of the team. Salaries for new employees are above average, but not top of the line.
Processes can be restrictive and inhibit innovation.
- Methodical processes might be viewed as ""slow"" to outsiders - If you are motivated by fancy titles (Sr. Associate VP of Outer Cape Cod), then this isn't the place for you
1) slow promotion 2) lower pay
There are no cons in particular
Everyone is very smart at the company.
Not much career growth for senior engineers Too much office politics
The location may not very good.
So groups can be very intense because of the many foreigners.
Culture has degraded over the years, hiring has been questionable at times Opportunities for growth limited Pay is really low compared to competitors No stock & bonuses really low Management is poor, direction is lacking a lot of times Biggest Con: Non-standard industry tools/skills non-transferrable
Compensation might not be as lucrative as the tech giants, but the work and benefits outweigh this inconvenience.
Slow career growth Projects can be intense
Not many opportunities for growth of salary
Too much of disposables waste which is common everywhere but it can be reduced.
Processes can feel a little slow, but there are reasons. We have never grown to fast and we have never done layoffs.
If I were criticizing one thing it would be the stingy vacation time policy.
must do technical support during first few months to a year of job
Slow growth slow promotions No stocks

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Apex-Systems-Reviews-E13916.htm,"nice people, good pay for a student. Recruiters do their best to get you a job.
Flexible work schedule with the benefit of getting a good grasp on, help desk support for, windows machines and office products. Work from home is a fantastic added benefit. A chance to get employed directly with Dell is a good carrot to have.
Great for experience and reasonable compensation as entry level and 2yr+ Helpdesk
They do have a customer care center that checks in every once in awhile, so even if you can't find your agent, you can call that number if you need help. One of the agents I had 5 years ago was very good about removing me from an unpleasant work situation and placing me in a better work opportunity at a different company. I felt heard, valued, and I really appreciated the care and attention to detail I received. That was not the same level of service I received from every agent.
Opportunity to earn a lot of money.
Solid delivery managers, feel most of them are pretty helpful.
0 - there are none.
They took really good care of me.
It's a remote job so it's very flexible with time as long as you are communicating, getting things done on time, and are prompt to virtual meetings, etc. Depending on your Client. and the team you get assigned to, you can be working closely with the Client making tons of new connections and building relationships to bolster your career or you could be a pencil-pusher type of employee that they don't want to know you or speak to you often. This all depends on the Client. I've worked for Apex for 2 years and the company itself has always been a solid foundation for its employees.
Opportunity to travel Good management Some assignments are on military bases When travel you have your own rental and your own hotel room. Sick time only Contracted plan with Fidelity - Netbenefits
Clear communication, Timely pay Swift resolution of any questions
They work with good clients like M&T Bank etc. The mobile app makes it easy to fill timecards.

The training is effective and helps dip your toe in the water, but the best experience comes from your day-to-day recruiting activity. You pick up on it quickly and within a short time your self sufficient. It takes some time to feel really good and secure but it's worth the experience in the end.
Got paid on time twice a month
Reasonable pay Remote work available for many jobs
-Excellent growth potential -Clear defined role
Apex Systems values time off, work-life balance, makes it a priority to coordinate team-building activities, catered lunches, scheduled happy hours, etc.

","Not a lot of jobs to transition to, could be do to the simple fact that a lot of jobs are laying workers off atm.
3 weeks of training for this roll gave me around 20% of the knowledge I needed to properly support the end users. Further training is short and the knowledge obtained from it may not actually be used until months later (as a T1 or T2). Half of the time I feel drastically under prepared to support someone I get on the phone. The pay is NOT sufficient enough when compared to other similar positions in the IT field.
Unfortunately there are several companies nearby that seem to be offering much greater compensation for similar and identical positions, so there is a high turnover rate. There are few options for leave, and it is given in small amounts per pay period.
1. I've been with Apex for 5 years, and I still can't enter sick time in my timesheet. It just gives me an error every time. The number of sick time hours the system shows I have accrued is never correct. 2. I referred someone a couple of years ago, she was hired on our team, and I had to inquire about the referral fee A YEAR LATER. If I hadn't remembered and asked about it, it would never have been paid to me. 3. Apex provides no meaningful benefits except a 401k. 4. In the 5 years I've been with Apex, I can't tell you how many agents I've had due to high turnover. It's hard to remember the name of my agent, since it tends to change every few months.
Hard to receive opportunity to stand out and demonstrate ability.
Going back to a hybrid schedule. Things went much smoother fully remote
Apex is, by far, the cheapest, unintentional, careless, worst, most bottom-shelf, lowest tier company I've ever worked for. Over my 12 years of government contracting, I've heard nothing but negative things about Apex, I should have listened to this advice and the reviews I've heard from others, to never work for this company and to not trust Apex with my career. I'll never refer anyone to this company because you all are cheap, and you offer no real benefits to your employees - why even exist as a company? This has been the absolute worst year of my career, mainly because of how horrible this company is.
I really can't think of any cons.
After about 2 years, they start to push off their employees to other managed services so they ""transition"" a bunch of employees to another company however you retain all the same day-to-day operations with your Client. Essentially don't view Apex as a long-term career move. This IS ONLY a stepping stone, to greater opportunities. Put in the entry-level time 1 to 2 years and move on. The pay is low as well so you won't want to be staying at $25-$27hr for too long anyways.
First, Per diem should be based on location per diem regardless the amount the travel tech spend, it should not be a reimbursement thing. Second, they shouldn't ask for receipt and it is too much to do for reimbursement, it should be automatic location per diem. Third, contract ended too early which make our entire team become unemployed, the company should have place us to another assignment or keep us employed until we find something else on site or remote. No PTO No reverence pay
An outdated and rather unstable time logging system
Require a lot of work on communication and being transparent with all the details. The requests made by the contractor must be taken on and completed within reasonable timelines.
they do not contact you in a timely manner for contract ending or renewing
Sometimes when the placed management at the assignment will not communicate properly or report work correctly
Low pay Can involve luck
I don’t have any cons, this is the best company to work for
Wage Discrimination- when I said how much I charge they no longer tried to place me. I then secured a rate more than I asked of them with the employer directly but unfortunately still had to close the req with them. No relationship- I don’t need a new best friend or daily checkins by any means but they are never in contact. When there was recruiter turn-around I was alerted the day of and received no exchanges from the newb, for months. When I finally heard from them via email since they needed something, I initiated an actual call. Ill-infomed: they are unaware of their own policies. In example, Nevada has PTO vs sick pay and it was conflicting to make sure that law was honored. Or another example, theyll ask for things like updating a system input but they dont grant permissions so its not even possible to do so. Outdated Technology- Despite multiple inputs on their portal, like uploading expense images, the images fail to attach. Or they attach but fail to be received. Another example, the mobile experience doesnt transition pages well. For example its blank or doesnt open or half screens when previewing paycheck to paycheck. Not at all user friendly And quite frankly they arent friendly either. I didnt choose them, had to use them because the employer does. But id select any other preferred vendor or competitor and Id never recommend anyone to them
As a contractor you’ll get paid well but have fewer benefits than as a regular employee.
No PTO No Sick Days Lower pay for the same job, when compared to the employees in the same position that were co reacted through a different company. There is absolutely no benefit for the employee to work as a subcontractor through Apex systems, or companies like it. I recommend everyone to avoid Apex Systems and companies like it. Work for the Prime instead of being a subcontracted employee. Apex systems and companies like it offer NO TECHNICAL VALUE to a project, they’re a head hunting/recruiting company. Career opportunities, NONE. You will not be promoted when you’re subcontracted to another company. Generally your supervisor will work for the prime, and you will be stuck as an employee of Apex Systems. Apex systems will not generally “release you” when you work for them. Comensation/benefits, your pay will be lower if you compare it to someone who works for the actual company that’s contracted by a customer. Example, two techs. One works for the prime, one works for apex. The responsibilities are the same, same experience, etc. apex will put you less. Also no PTO. Culture and values…….LOL WHAT? You will never actually meet anyone from Apex systems, except other subcontracted employees. Apex systems has no culture, you’ll be lucky if you’re recruiter ever calls you again after you’re hired. They won’t even give you an apex systems shirt. Senior management, you’ll never meet them so idk. Work life balance, same as any other company.
No future: unless you are friends or related to higher-ups your chance of growth are non-existent. One of the most unorganized organizations that I worked with-lack of transparency is a huge reason. Upper management are only out for themselves and do not promote within.
Messy back office practices and tracking spread, paying you properly, etc.
Contract position mostly entailed busy work and no real possibility of advancement.
Very results driven, moving goal posts
Got fired for no reason
I had/have no negative comments.
Not many. It's a resourcing company fiulled with good people
Never sides with their consultants even when clients are abusive and behave inappropriately Threaten to ESCALATE if you don't return your equipment immediately (even if you are out of town) which is hilarious, since there is no legal recourse to remote workers who don't return equipment (look it up) Even when I sent the equipment back exactly on the day I promised to do so, they did not BOTHER to check the tracking to see that this was done and continued to threaten and harangue me.
Management is young so there is some blind leading the blind but they are well trained and polished. Selling services is hard no matter who you work for. Base pay was brutal.
-low base salary -low commission structure -swim or sink environment -favoritism and ageism is a very real problem in the Houston branch
I was let go due to budget cuts and it was totally out of the blue.

It's a sales environment from the jump and they give you some time to ramp up, but it requires a lot of consistency to start feeling any kind of reward.

-low base salary -low commission structure -swim or sink environment -favoritism and ageism is a very real problem in the Houston branch
Base pay for recruiter is extremely low. Yes, there is opportunity for commission, but to acquire enough, one needs to have been with the company for multiple years.
Management openly talks poorly about employees, in office culture is toxic making remote days a relief rather than added flexibility. No work-life balance if you want to hit bonuses/succeed. Unlimited PTO is nice but it’s so easy to get behind if you take time off.
Communication between management and employees could have been better. Sean Casey laughed at the recruiters when we talked about not making enough money. It really was not a fun place to work at. When management isn't willing to hear their people out and they expect you to work your tail off for pennies, it's a bummer. We were told that Account Managers and Recruiters were equals and that it was a partnership, neither could work without the other. However, Account Managers got paid more than us, and if you became an account manager after being a recruiter, it was considered a promotion. I really felt like I was being held back at this company. I'm glad I moved on.
No PTO or Sick Days Insurance is unaffordable even if you make six figures They are just there to collect their fee, they will never check on you or buy you lunch
unsurety on projects if they will end or so.
-work life balance - delivery is slow/inefficient - unrealistic expectations - commission plan is not straight forward (threshold to see significant payout is extremely high) - often working multiple roles simultaneously - lack of diversity - 30 year company that will most likely tank in the coming years
It's a sales environment from the jump and they give you some time to ramp up, but it requires a lot of consistency to start feeling any kind of reward.
Pay Bonus is up to $2000 but you only receive $1200 if you hit 100% No diversity
No training or growth. If you contract is temporary be ready to find another job when it ends.

There were no major cons of working here.

Contracts with clients can end abruptly without notifying the company leaving recruiters confused.
Contract ended no warning. Was told would have another job for us but there was nothing
No Comment No Comment No Comment
none that i can think of
there is a lot of pressure to hit numbers.
Mostly commissioned based after a year.
Not all the roles have the same benefits
None that I can think of
Low pay Location was very far from where i lived
- no support from management - they promote SOLELY based on numbers, not whether or not someone would actually make a good leader - Delivery Manager doesn’t handle confrontation well, and when he does have to confront someone he does it so you don’t even know that you’re being confronted - Expected to work like a dog for an unlivable salary - In the 7 months I was there, 8 people left, not including myself - The best opportunities and the most help is given to those who are seen as “successful” - They prey on new college graduates desperate for a job knowing they can exploit them
Most people in executive leadership are white males who have never worked for another company. We have very few women in leadership and women are predominantly the top performers. there has been significant turnover in comparison to other branches and executive leadership turns a blind eye to consistent issues.
long hours at work not the best
None that I can think of.
No pto till a long time usually, no growth in some positions
contract (length of employment has a limit) can be stressful with upset business owners lack of career advancement in place
Very disorganized Gossiping Very bad management
Terrible pay if market is bad you make no money
Unsupported and they don't return phone calls after the contract is signed.
none! good first role to have
No formalized training program, cronyism, promotions based off home life, below average pay, unclear expectations, poor communication, conflicting feedback, blame culture, inefficient, poor use of tools at their disposal, inability to retain employees, sexual harassment, uneven workload within department, inequitable expectations for working class employees, poor growth management, poor root cause analysis, hire for personality not skillset, dishonest management.
Contract ended no warning. Was told would have another job for us but there was nothing

They belittle and humiliate their employees and take advantage of recent college grads. It’s an impossible situation. They pay poorly too.

They pay you the bare minimum they legally can. Barely live-able income. They then sell you a fake dream of making hundreds of thousands of dollars. In reality, you will be recruiting on a new spot every week often entry level spots, with flaky people. Often you’re competing with multiple other agencies. It takes a LONG time to see success. Management picks favorites to invest their time into, and if you’re not one you will be left in the dust working on spots that you will likely see no success. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
My experience with my recruiter was not great. Contractor Services had no idea what was going on most of the time either The job I was contracted for promised full training knowing I was not very experienced in the field and was given a brief overview of the job's multiple aspects. Medical Benefits were atrocious and done through Healthcare.gov when it was expressed to me they had a good benefits package
It's not for everybody - you'll be given the tools to succeed but you have to roll up your sleeves and create your own success.
Mostly contractual positions that is it
There is No Paid Leave
Commission based on market and external factors

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-Hartford-Reviews-E4314.htm,"The Hartford is a leading edge technology place to work where Life Balance, Ethics, DE&I and even being Green, all are day to day priorities. People that leave usually come back. The Hartford treats their employees better than anywhere else and that makes the difference.
Opportunity for advancement, good leadership, annual bonuses based upon performance, pay for performance, communication frequent
Lots of people enjoy working here for 20+ years - which means that you end up with ""group think"" - many people only know the experience in The Hartford. I see this as both a pro and a con.
This place has a small company feel. The directors know your name, your face, and your story any time they see you. Everyone is supportive of one another. I took a pay cut to work here, and honestly, I don't regret it one bit. It's the best decision I've ever made in my career. There is little to no stress, there are so many incentives, and the commissions can make up for the starting pay. The base salary is nice because it's still on par with what's out there, but if you work in sales, you can make so much more on top of that. I do not stress or worry about much since I've started here. This company ACTUALLY listens to their employees. Promotions are NOT based on who you know, but they are based on performance... Love that. There's so much more I can add, but I will say that they are doing a great job at taking care of us while ensuring that we are treated with respect by giving us the freedom to work as adults. No micromanaging here! I've worked for a few different insurance companies, and this one has by far been the best one. This truly how I feel.
I have had few corporate jobs over the years, none, match The Hartford way. The team experience, knowledge, and backing of my fellow employees has been very impressive. Reach out and they reach back in seconds. Truly, to be working with a team has lead to my comfort during onboarding. The management staff is also present on a daily basis. If you thought working from home, meant working alone, feeling isolated with no help, you would be wrong in this situation at The Hartford Premium Audit Division. The Hartford also promotes an in company growth, offering an immense number of self taught courses to grow your career. Classes in management growth for each division, coding, Microsoft products and so much more. Let's not forget benefits, investing in my HSA, 401K savings and deposits by The Hartford, vacation and flex Fridays. Come join us and see!

fine. nice people. not too much work
You get tons of sales incentives separate from your actual pay. The pay is good when you start but hard to get a meaningful raise after that.
Working at The Hartford, my experience has been very positive. Everyone I met was very smart, professional and enthusiastic about their jobs. The work I was responsible for was challenging, interesting and rewarding.
Good benefits Great place to learn the industry and what it means to be an underwriter, but take that knowledge and apply elsewhere. For the sake of your sanity and pay increase.
Great employees that welcome you and make you part of their team.
Plenty of opportunity for learning and development

","Compensation has been rumored to be less competitive in the past but that no longer seems to be the case. Working from home is often an option and if a position requires being in the office for collaboration for most positions it is only 2 days a week.
Workload, work-life balance challenges, but probably consistent with industry
Policies meant to control risk are so oppressive we cannot get work done effectively. We are forced into very strict usage of software - with so many things blocked due to a blanket security policy. The tools that are dictated: MS Office and nothing else hamper and hinder creativity, collaboration and keep us from doing our jobs well. Recently, they have started to pressure people to be in office - but what happens when there is NO office to go to? People have moved or you hired them where there is no office. To be fair, The Hartford isn't the only company adopting stricter ""RTO"" policy - but it seems to be implemented with little thought given to the impact to morale and productivity across the enterprise. I don't believe our C-Suite is connected to the needs of the employees - consistent negative employee surveys have created a culture of fear of speaking truth to power - people do not feel safe to tell the truth.
Of course, there are normal tech issues and times when it's uncomfortable to implement new processes and guidelines, but nothing crazy. There's always room to be better! :)
Currently I am working states from NY to CA, this presents a challenge in balancing hours to be available for all my Insured's
Cons- Health benefits - only HDHP or ridiculous copays for anything outside a normal office visits, mental health benefits unaffordable Unrealistic push for metrics and efficiency that contradict company stated goals Training is not standardized across the company for the role No clear defined Career Progression paths No upward mobility, rare lateral moves No investment into the infrastructure or technology that is backbone of the company and what you have to use to support the customer, or the big push to digital - root cause problem solve strategies are not allowed to use the IT department as a solution when it is the clear issue No investment in upskilling or reskilling current workforce Cannot schedule days off when you need them. While the PTO is generous, all the days to request are always in red far in advance. You have to put in your entire year's off requests in October for the upcoming year (October 2022 you had to put in all your requested time off for 2023).
This company lacks diversity but acts as though they care about it. I say this because the leadership positions you have all the same type of people, white women. Also I saw a lot of nepotism in my 4 years of working there. I watched the department I was in hire in unexperianced workers who worked only in retail, bakery, and even a pet store. But would look over a referral who was over qualified for the role. I don't trust this company
Teams are overwhelmed and poor performance is allowed to continue which decreases employee satisfaction
Lots of red tape preventing software engineers from performing basic functions (the worst I experienced is being denied access to deploy code). This severely limits your ability to improve things and causes high churn among developers. Non tech roles seem to experience less churn
The Hartford used to be a wonderful place to work however over the last few years, it has gone downhill in how they treat their employees. Employees are over-worked, underpaid and micromanaged heavily. Working remote is good to an extent, it's terrible for your mental health and they closed so many offices that going into the office to get actual human interaction is impossible now. They are constantly changing things that don't need fixing and it ends up being a terrible mistake in the long run, costing job loss of good employees and then hiring new ones after they realize the mistake they made.
When the management is good, it's very very good. When it's bad, it becomes farcical. Absolute obsession with minor metrics that don't have anything to do with the claims process masquerading as ""customer satisfaction"". IT support is entirely offshore and the language barrier is real. Upper management (C-suite) is really detached from reality when it comes to addressing things like wage stagnation/keeping up with inflation.
Probably the most disorganized place I've ever worked and it's only been getting worse. ZERO sense of urgency so nothing ever gets done which causes the team to be (apparently) stressed (an odd paradox??). Engineers don't care about learning or understanding problems. A lot of unprofessional beef with other coworkers in public settings which can be awkward during larger calls. Compensation is lacking based on productivity so there's no incentive to work hard.
The benefits could be better.
So by now everyone knows the 5 star reviews are the result of a manager leaning over and making you do it to keep your job..but did you know they have changed the daily schedule to force unpaid hours…so you clock in like normal but when it’s slow you clock out for “breaks” but there’s not enough time to leave the office..but then you clock in when call volume increases, so you are at work for 10 hours but only paid for 8 because of your “breaks”…
A lot of inconsistency of how things are applied - in some areas, the culture is great but in others, it's not good. Changes often happen that benefit executives, not regular employees
You are underpaid for the amount of claims you have to process.
I'm not sure I'm getting appropriate compensation.
Alternative market toxic and negative work environment
Micromanaged. Work from home being removed
Really doesn't have a good work life balance as they make it to be. Underwriters also need higher pay.
too much outsourcing of IT
People tend to stay, which is a good thing overall, but can limit the number career growth opportunities
Claims departments are absolutely overrun. It's a consistent cycle of needing more workers, hiring new people who start off behind, they get overwhelmed and quit, so they hire more workers...
Have to start from the bottom and level up.
High call volume and too many metrics we're expected to meet.
Work/life balance isn’t great. Very demanding
-Figure out your time off 6 months in advance as they use a bidding system for time off. -They want you to help the customer without actually helping most times by referring to adjusters who can't be bothered to answer their phones or respond to emails
Less PTO's than my previous company. but we can purchase 40 hours /year
they'll pay you next to nothing
The disorganization paired with their unrealistic and laughable customer service goals is just subpar and comical. The amount of case load with not much support when needed just adds to this place as a joke.

Leadership teams stay too long in their comfort zone and don't pay enough attention to the future.
Lack of communication, planning, execution. IT is so poorly staffed and overwhelmed, nothing gets addressed. Requests can linger for years. CEO decided seemingly very suddenly that any employee within a certain radius, regardless of their current remote work situation must come into the office at least 2 days a week. Even if said employee was originally hired as a remote employee, previously sent home fully remote pre Covid, or had a previously approved full remote standing with company. “No exceptions.” I can understand the desire to have more of a presence, but forcing people who live on fixed incomes, have acquired a work life balance with children, family or otherwise to start coming in at the drop of a hat is horribly inefficient, and it will cause a lot of valuable employees to seek outside opportunities. Time and money spent on childcare, commuting, car care/wear etc. is not worth losing productivity. Wfh employees put in more time and better production because they’re happy and feel valued/appreciated. I suggest they provide incentives to current or potential hybrid or in office employees (commuting/care care bonus, childcare stipend, higher overall salary).
The computer systems are at least a decade behind my previous employer. In talking with seasoned employees, they felt that there isn't enough budget that goes to improving the computer systems.
The case load is too large.
Poor leadership in the Group Benefits sales organization.
However, there was always (always) more work than the group could handle, with the company often bringing in people from unrelated departments to handle to volume of work. Dealing with claimants can be a hit or miss (usually miss) experience, though often understandable since the claimants are dealing with difficult situations. Expected to answer a high percentage of incoming calls, which can be difficult to impossible to reach based on the volume of calls and the need to have at least a little bit of uninterrupted time to get work done.
The claim volume/workload is highly unrealistic and seems to only continue growing to the point where it has doubled from when I first started. There is no limit to the amount of work you will be assigned per day. Nothing of significance has been done to help the staff despite extremely low morale across the unit and high turnover, and there are constant empty promises from upper management to “hang in there”. Even with doubled workloads, you are still expected to have the same timeliness and performance, which requires working weekends and well into the night/evening. The pay is slightly above average to entice workers to the job but I would advise against it because the amount of work is just totally unrealistic and leads to burnout extremely quickly. The Hartford tries to stress the importance of mental health, but this seems hypocritical because they don’t actually seem to care about work/life balance or the mental toll of overworking employees. The customers and customer satisfaction are stressed as the most important things at the organization, when in reality the amount of claims received in a day prevents positive customer experiences and does not allow us to provide ethical or thorough reviews/care. Individual team leads try their absolute best to support staff, but it’s difficult when upper management is completely disengaged and more concerned about the “business needs” of the organization than actually helping their burnt out and overwhelmed staff. Look elsewhere. Not a good work environment.
You have to be your biggest advocate
Personal lines sales:Micro managed, back to back calls nonstop. Expected to be at your desk taking calls 95-98% of your day. Have to jump through hoops to get commission, goals are high $100-$500 commission for meeting and exceeding goals. Can be cut in half if close rate is too low or bundle rate is too low. Managers/leadership act like everything is okay. Doing the job of sales and service for the same pay. No pay raises. Have to work weekends even if you’ve been there for years. Managers ignore the quality of customers /prices we get, but expect us to sell everything possible. If you’re in this department try to get out. Toxic environment covered up with woohoos and emojis in the team chat.
-Figure out your time off 6 months in advance as they use a bidding system for time off. -They want you to help the customer without actually helping most times by referring to adjusters who can't be bothered to answer their phones or respond to emails
Time help pay no travel
I dont see any cons working here
Nothing that i can think of
they'll pay you next to nothing
Can’t avoid the big company feel High stress is unsustainable Pushing more to in-office vs remote
No cons nothing negative to say. Sometimes customers can be rude, but thats apart of being a service rep
Departments do not communicate properly.
No significant cons for company
The disorganization paired with their unrealistic and laughable customer service goals is just subpar and comical. The amount of case load with not much support when needed just adds to this place as a joke.
Management is tough Workload is alor
Time help pay no travel
Call center environment with no relief between calls. Didn't pay enough and continued asking for more and more from employees.
Time off not available for anything that comes up. You have to schedule weeks in advance or it will be counted against you. I was put in the hospital and my absence was not approved. It was considered ""unscheduled"". I was admitted through the emergency room so not sure how I would ""schedule"" that. My manager had a sink or swim mentality and did not seem to have new employees best interest at heart. She had favorites which were very tenured reps. I was always told great things about the Hartford and I am so disappointed that my experience was so different. I had plans to retire with the company.
I dont see any cons working here

Stats based company , no room for growth
No cons nothing negative to say. Sometimes customers can be rude, but thats apart of being a service rep
does not pay based on current inflation and housing market in the immediate area of the office some management hires do not make sense, they look at years experience at the company vs. managereal characteristics
Very busy, back to back calls.
Overtime and claims never end
None for me, it’s a great company
Company is slow to advance pay for existing employees while preferring to offer larger salaries to new hires
Inner city location with high crime
Promotion to senior roles is based on seniority and really only available through attrition. Plan to work a few years and jump to another company if you want recognition commensurate with your contributions.
None that are worth mentioning
Politics and favoritism like anywhere else Some performative inclusion talking points without major change Lower pay than competitors because people want to work there Metrics don’t truly reward or promote the best like most places Overworking, stress and burnout because work goals are too high for the amount of employees compared to competitor workload/pace
Managers works late and have the same expectation for lower-level staff.
Same thing, no one comes and checks on you
Pay not as good as some competitors
Not so good management and training
- If you decide to leave the company then they do not pay any of your PTO out - Honestly, working on insurance can be extremely boring so you’ll have to make the most out of it. Having a good team can make it fun though. - Okay pay/benefits - Bringing on new talent in the mid/senior level seems to be tough - How some applications are built are unnecessarily complex and hard to understand. Meaning it takes a long time for someone new to contribute.
- Pay is on the lower end

Metrics. you have to have high survey scores or they will not give you a raise nor bonus. They do not promote to different positions if you are a minority. Most people promoted is nonblacks with little to no experience and but they require blacks to have experience. Supervisors are changed often in customer service department.
They do not value their employees
Inner city location with high crime
Work - Almost nothing expected as far as is concerned. Just a couple of hours at best per week. Even with so little work expected, you are told by management if you feel this is too much, we can reduce this! Meetings - All day and repeated over and over.
Every moment of every day monitored in the call centers Could pay more

only fine. nothing exciting at all
No sick days are given, you have to use your PTO to call out sick. They force you to work weekends. If you work the closing shift you are forced to stay until a manager dismisses you. They force you to work most holidays. They will try to keep you in sales over promoting you. Not flexible with schedule changes. The sales team is forced to work when the service team is closed. Promotions are more about who you know rather than the work you do. Instead of offering new positions directly to employees, they send it to the directors first who then have to send it to the regular managers who then send it to the employees. (I recently missed an opportunity to apply for a job I was doing on the job training for because the sales director never sent the offer to my manager)
The remote working policy was limited to one day per week. However that may have changed due to Covid.
Truly good employees with great work ethic, knowledge and tenure are overlooked, while the ""yes"" people with little to no experience move up quickly. Toxic work environment Poor management that makes it even more stressful Constructive criticism or questioning, even when asked for honest feedback, is seen as being ""negative"" Large distrust in immediate management, not necessarily high level management.
Salaries are not competitive to keep up with the COL.
At the mercy of your team lead…what is totally fine with one will be micromanaged by another even if your work is done.
Tenure obsessed culture, outside experience & skills can be frequently ignored, internal connection biases, millennial & gen z staff not leveraged and are still ""paying their dues""
- Boring as all get out
I don't have any cons
Technology is challenged at times
Poor training, no support and overwhelming amount of work.
Location was the primary negative aspect.
The could be way better
Can be busy at times

Awesome team and culture even as a remote employee. Fast paced role with lots to learn and a lot of potential for impact.
Angi is a company full of empowerment and resources for improvement for their sales staff. An incredibly supporting environment and I liked everyone I worked with. The company has a great culture and leadership is very empowering in a genuine way, and is always available as a resource. I would recommend this company to someone who has proven sales success and is looking for a career company.
Angi is at an incredibly transformational moment in time. We have a fantastic, no-nonsense , innovative, confident CEO and an incredibly smart, precise, scrappy team pointed at the biggest opportunities and issues in the business. It's truly an exciting time to be at Angi, with lots of opportunities to grow and innovate. Since joining Angi, I have taken on different leadership roles across the business, demonstrating Angi’s commitment to putting the right people in the right roles and offering opportunities across the board. One of the best parts of Angi is the people. You will be surrounded by some of the smartest and most thoughtful people I've ever worked with, who are motivated to solve difficult problems and providing the best possible solutions to our customers.

Great Entry Level Job Perfect for anyone in sales Great team Culture is fun Opportunity to make a lot of money In Depth Training
- Management cares about your success and supporting you in getting there - They have great benefits, and I have always been able to achieve a positive work/life balance through transparency and open communication with my manager - I truly feel like my work matters, and I see the opportunity for growth. I've experienced it myself three times during my time here
Met some of the best salespeople I’ve ever encountered. Culture is positive, encouraging and patient. The remote work arrangement felt like “being there” without leaving home. Felt part of the group , but not “watched”. Liked my manager, was patient, down to earth, realistic, not too much Koolaid drinking.if you are comfortable with a non-emotional one-call close sales model—this is a great place to succeed.
Work from home (for now) and benefits are good in terms of affordability and coverage
What’s a good headline for my Glassdoor Review for the message below? Angi, Inc. is an exceptional company that truly values and supports its employees. As a Senior Marketing Executive with eight years of experience at the company, I can confidently say that Angi provides its team members with the tools and opportunities needed to achieve personal and professional growth. From starting out as an inside sales representative to assuming a leadership role, I have been fortunate to work for a company that prioritizes employee wellbeing and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. I am grateful to my colleagues, supervisors, and directors for their unwavering support, guidance, and confidence in my abilities. Their support has been instrumental to my success and has allowed me to make meaningful contributions to the company's growth and success. I am excited to continue working with this exceptional team and contributing to the ongoing success of Angi for many years to come.
Decent work/life balance. Pay is good in relation to the market right now.
I love that they continue to encourage us to learn more to be better prepared for our jobs.
I have been having a blast at Angi. I think if you put in the work you can really succeed here. Love my job and love my trainers! Can't wait for what's to come! 100% commission!
I was 11k away from making 300k my first year. Anyone who says they didn’t make money clearly can’t do the job AND THATS OKAY. Not every one has it in them to get rejected a hundred times a day by a hundred different people but still remain CONFIDENT. When people don’t see success within the first week/month they start to doubt their abilities. Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will. All you need to do this job is EXTREMLY high confidence. The skills will be taught but the sales come from confidence. I’m okay with being rejected 100 times a day by a hundred different people to make the 20-30k a month that I do The trainers are amazing, with hype energy, and are super patient and attentive. They have open meetings like every day for you to share suggestions with the Vice President or to just speak to him. Every quarter they tell u about the quarter that just ended n future plans and have a Q and A Managers have to start as sales reps first so most growth happens from within Freeee healthcare Discounts with soooo many brands because ANGI is owned by IAC who own a lot more than 100 other brands.
fantastic commission payout options great opportunities for bonuses work from home
Remote work was great. Some of the people I met cared about who I was as a person beyond being an employee. Some people want the department to get better. Benefits were pretty good.
-Good people, although most left while I was there -Flexible with work from home -Free lunch and snacks
- remote job - good benefits - lower management was great
A base salary No weekends or overtime expected.
-The recruiting/onboarding process was thorough but seamless as the People team at Angi are strong communicators and super helpful throughout the process -Beautiful office in NYC with a strong culture despite hybrid work schedule -Opportunities for growth / cross-team collaboration
There is opportunity for growth as a sales rep
- Top tier colleagues - Remote/Hybrid flexibility - Future Vision - Compensation / Time Off / Benefits There has been a ton of change at Angi in the time I have been here, but its all toward cleaning up known issues, and making the product and the experience the best ever. Its an exciting time to be here, to know what we are building and to further cement ourselves as the leaders in this industry
The work environment was fantastic, free parking, unlimited snacks, unlimited PTO, hybrid work schedule and great health insurance.
I have never worked for a company with such a strong culture. It is highly competitive, but not cut-throat like a lot of sales organizations out there. I have always felt welcome and valued as an employee from the very beginning. Angi has changed my life, incredible place to work!
You will get lots of feedback that is oriented around your own professional growth and development (for better or worse!). The talent bar is very high. Employees here care deeply about our customers - both homeowners and the service professionals we support.
Angi is one of the best companies I have worked at by far. The recruitment process went quickly and smoothly! The recruiter I worked with had me in my position within 3 weeks. The team was super communicative and ensured that they could meet my timeline in my search for a new position. They truly catered the recruitment process to each candidates individual needs and makes you feel important through the process. Angi truly values a positive work place environment. Executives are always around for whole office lunches to chat and take opportunities to hold panels for their employees to hear feedback that they have and actually take action to make every employee valued and heard. Angi also emphasizes greatly on work life balance and encourage you to take the time that you need as long as your work is getting completed. I am extremely happy in my position and look forward to continuing my growth here!
Most departments are still WFH. Some of the best IT/Engineering resources in the country. Good PTO benefits. Good help from management. Known many who have started at one level within the company and moved up multiple times within a 24 month period.
Great management and encouraging team. We had a seperate division of Angi and we were crushing it.
great commission rates and unlimited potential
Remote, encouragement, supportive/caring peers and management, enthusiastic trainers, I guess the potential to make a lot of money exists (???)
Fully remote, although they are trying to get people back into the office by offering higher base pay and lunch. The coworkers were great and encouraging. If you don't have any prior cold-calling or sales experience you get solid, basic training on the sales cycle and develop objection handling skills.

- great pay and benefits - some decent technologies - infrastructure, CI/CD and technology is moving in the right direction - a wide array of technologies from Java, Spring, AWS, Scala, etc
Uncapped Commission Managers are helpful
Amazing culture with a lot of talented individuals always pushing each other to progress. Management is hands on enough but also let's you have the freedom to push yourself. Working from home is a huge positive if you're self-motivated. Unlimited earning potential, the harder you work the more money you make!
Amazing culture, leadership development program, strong teamwork, fun environment, lots of potential to earn money sales wise and through contests.
There are great benefits you just have to be sure you are using them! They are relatively flexible with WFH, however, the return to office has been messy including an email sent to your supervisor if you missed an “in-office” day. The Denver office is cool with beer on tap, snacks, a pool table, and pinball machines. The accounting team is fun to be around.
Best best best best best
Very high commission pay opportunity for this type of role. Uncapped commission. Great support system from peers and management.

The senior leadership team is really strong and has cultivated excitement for the future vision across the company. We are continuing to do what's right for Service Providers and Consumers. There is still a lot to do, but I see this improving regularly. The work is challenging and you can make a real impact here.

They’ll hire just about anyone if you seem hungry enough.

Amazing pay, positive company culture, benefits are incredible, opportunity for growth, life changing opportunity.
Great coworkers and camaraderie with those on your level
Potential for high commissions and I was on a good team of fun people.
Good money, nice environment, friendly coworkers
Pay is fairly good for the masochists out there
","I haven't found one. Even with all of the changes, which I guess could be considered a downside, I don't see it like that. There hasn't been one change made where it negatively impacted the employees/company as a whole. So as long as you can adapt and lean on your team and your management when needed, no bad days here.
None that I have seen so far.
It's a very hard product to sell. You're selling to blue-collar workers who don't want to talk on the phone period, let alone to a tele-marketer. The Angi name has been dragged through the mud in the last few years with the FCC order - the order was settled but that doesn't mean anything to people who heard about it. For the aforementioned reasons, you should be an experienced sales person coming into this role, which is not something they explicitly advertise in job postings. On top of all of this it's an established product which means the more bad reviews, the more people have heard the negative aspects. Angi pulls leads from 3rd parties, which leads to a lot of less-than-promising (aka bogus) leads being sold at premium prices. You will regularly be fielding a litany of anecdotal experiences and perspectives, from hard-willed people. Additionally, the commission payout structure incentivizes long term employment and being an instant success at the company. Not necessarily a bad thing by any means, but something to consider. **If you are not selling you will be working a very taxing job for very little money.**
Angi is a big business, and while we are scrappy and innovative, someone with only startup experience may not find this a good fit. Rigorous debate and intellectual honesty are encouraged, and that environment may not work if you prefer to simply follow a preset list of tasks.
Customers are rude A lot of rejections super fast paced
No big cons - sometime you haven't hunt down information, however, I've always been able to find what I need and everyone is helpful
Base pay is ridiculously low. That should change significantly once people graduate from the training program. Learned that PTO means you only get base hourly pay, not reflective of your actual earned income level. This is a one-call close. Takes a particular skill set; if you aren’t comfortable with a non-emotional style of selling, pass on this opportunity.
Insane expectations for garbage pay, constantly decreasing opportunities to earn, incompetent middle management mixed with severely out of touch upper management, and the list goes on. Recently fired like 30 top earners due to a bug in their own poorly designed CRM and screening process and half the sales floor is on paperwork at any given time. It’s like they want to run their employees out and see another quarter of profit loss. The expectations inside and outside of the sales process are constantly increasing while the comp plan passes on the expenses of doing business to the rep. I’m constantly being asked to do more and more for less pay. I could go on and on but at the end of the day they do not care what anyone thinks about anything
One potential con that could be mentioned is that the company's fast-paced environment may not be suitable for everyone, as it can require a high level of adaptability and flexibility.
Every 3-6 month cycle has been the same. Rush to slap together a half-baked roadmap. Rush to throw together a feature based on that roadmap. Run into roadblocks mid-development because there's no subject matter experts. Rush to deliver the feature because ""the next quarter depends on it!"" Then re-org at the start of the next quarter, de-prioritize the roadmap, hand off the previous work to a different team that's new to the area, start the whole cycle over. There's no time to grow subject matter experts because of the constant re-orgs. Every claim of ""this feature is important"" seems like a lie, because the feature dies the next month due to a re-org. The push to get things done has lost all meaning, because the features being launched lose longevity. It's exhausting and unsustainable.
That the commission changes eac H month and you have to prepare for lower months that doesn’t profit as much.
Nothing bad to say about this company
Managers are human and some can’t lead. It impacts the team negatively when that’s the case. Of course u get fired when ur not hitting goal for 2 MONTHS straight. TBH I think that’s more than fair. A lot of people don’t make it ( either from not reaching goals or quitting because the rejection was too much for thier mental health)
culture no work/life balance (if you want your life to be phone sales this is not a con) management
I would be cautious of joining. A lot of hasty decisions being made that the trickle down impact will land directly on the lower-level employees shoulders with no guidance or help in thinking through the problems that are created. I was there for over a year, and cannot say that my supervisor helped me with any process-related problems or helped me to be better at my job. A lot of being thrown into things with no guidance and management does not care or take the time to help. Hateful comments about past employees thrown around, bullying people they did not see fit for the company out, outsourcing positions and then neglecting to train the employees. Little to no professional growth or care for me as a person. No vision on how to make the team better and more efficient. Boys club vibe at the top. Felt like I was not able to speak up about my struggles in fear of getting bullied out of the company. It's not in my nature to write a bad review on a job experience, but I would be cautious of Angi at this time.
The Work -Overly aggressive reforecasting cadence that consumes way more time than it's worth, very limited analysis -Be prepared to spend hours explaining variances that are smaller than 1% (why?!) -Mundane busy work with unnecessary timelines, basically just reporting the news on a weekly basis. Lots of legacy work with no explanation as to why -Scheduled Sunday work -0 organization from upper management/leadership. Everything is due the next day. More late nights than its worth, constant moving targets -Yes-man leadership, upper management has never said no to a request for the finance team, even though the team was reduced ~50% in a matter of months. Constantly looking to get more granular in their reporting but refuse to replace employees who left -Above the director levels, not always sure what people do. The Culture -Hard to say the culture was bad when, in fact, there really wasn't a culture at all. Working in a void. -Most members of the finance team seem pretty unhappy -No communications from upper management. Everything goes unaddressed (layoffs, people leaving, etc.) -Lack of respect from upper management -Being the absolute last people in the office every night gets pretty bothersome -Embarrassingly bad holiday schedule The Long Term -No real avenues for upward mobility -Very top heavy: 2 VP's of Finance managing effectively the same team, as well as a CFO, as well as the business unit leaders you will also semi report to -No feedback has been taken seriously, things continue to get worse. -Constantly reshuffling the finance team to make it seem like they are filling the gaps from employees who left, but really just spreading the work around -0 forward momentum. Just a middling ads and leads business with little direction. Equity is worthless since new management took over
- not great business model - laid off entire department - not really helping homeowners - just trying to make money anyway they can
Extreme micromanagement. Culture is super toxic. Their way or the highway to the extreme, all the way down to scripts they expect you to follow almost word for word. Just now received a message from my manager asking why I haven’t made a call in 15 minutes. Very scummy sales tactics. Vast majority of our contractors dislike us. Most contractors that have used us in the past seem unhappy(management knows this and they say they didn’t use the product correctly) Only the top 10-15% actually make what they promise in interviews. I can go on and on.
-Ideally would have appreciated being told that company is switching to a 3 day in-person hybrid schedule before having started (was told that I would be working only two days in the office)
You are underpaid for the amount of work you must do (do you like hats? you'll be wearing 4 different ones for $14/hr). Leadership believes their own nonsense and will put the blame on you for a lack of sales. It's hard to sell when the company has a poor image in the eyes of every contractor.
- Data Complexity (but being worked on) With change comes uncertainty and a new way of thinking, so at times it can feel a little crazed, but its good to see the way that new teams align to work towards the future vision
Too much change and layoffs going on.
It's difficult and not for the faint of heart or those who lack grit and determination. That's also what makes this place so amazing. If you succeed here, you did it on your own, you made it happen, but it is going to require an insane amount of commitment and discipline.
There has been considerable change at Angi over the past few years. While we are super optimistic about our future and the current strategy, change can be tough to deal with.
I have no downsides working at Angi at this current moment!
Pay can fluctuate and can feel like it's outside of your control in some departments.
Corporate management shut down the department when times got tough. Did a terrible job with the process. It was a 5 minute zoom call with 100+ people on it and then we were all logged out of everything. That was all.
Micromanaging environment, you are on zoom call all day everyday. They monitor your activity every hour and make over 200 dials a day and have over 3.5 hours of talk time.
I worked at Angi for five months. I started out strong, made two approved sales (three submits) just in the first two weeks on the phone during the training period (before getting assigned to my team). 90% of the people you manage to have a conversation with hate Angi and everything it’s about. So you have to capitalize on the 10% who have never heard of Angi. If you mention Home Advisor or Angie’s List, then you probably only have 5% to capitalize on. Again this is just the percentage of people who actually pick up the phone. It probably takes 15-30 calls or more to find someone willing to give you more than a minute. Some days are better than others. Then you have to withhold the truth or manipulate them. If you’re good, which I was, you can manage to extend conversations fairly long but they will eventually hang up or tell you they need to talk to their wife or cat about it. Many of the people you speak to are good hearted people but living pay check to pay check or worse. And Angi expects you to push the call as far as you can which essentially means belittling the SP and building a value proposition that could destroy their livelihood and business. That makes me sick. There is A LOT of money to be LOST by providers who sign up. I couldn’t do this and my success suffered. There were some of the nicest hard working people on my team who made no sales because they were kind people. I know some people have innate sales talent, but it’s different and that concept doesn’t apply here. At some point we were informed leads were sourced from other sites besides Angi itself, and this was an extreme concern to me. When I asked for clarification none was provided. I think it was addressed with a meme or GIF. Essentially every time a legitimate concern was brought up it was probably replied to by a manager or director with a meme or GIF. Lol but not. I was aware of the FTC investigation when I accepted the job but I needed a job and wanted sales experience - which was an audible from my past experience. If you’re reading this and considering a role here make sure you read into the FTC investigation and charges issued. You will spend 45 minutes on a call, get all the necessary details, send the electronic contract, they will hang up and you will never reconnect with them again. There are people who make a ton of money but I’m convinced they have mastered how to con providers. There are more fulfilling and honorable professions out there. A reasonable amount of the positive reviews you read on here must be from reps who have only been with the company for a short period of time and/or never had a remote job. They hire just about anyone for this position from restaurant workers to hotel staff which is fine but Angi is going for quantity over quality in the form of finding people to make dials who aren’t in a position to realize they are giving time and effort for an illegitimate cause. BUT, maybe I am wrong and I’m the problem. Anyways, I’m happy to report I am in a much better place in an account management role now and have removed Angi from my resume and experience. I liked a lot of the people I worked with at Angi.
Recycled prospects. Most people hang up as soon as they know you're from Angi. If you happen to get someone who hasn't been contacted before, they've probably heard negative feedback about the company from fellow contractors. Simply a hard sell and directors have no issues firing you if you can't keep up with their metrics.
-Ideally would have appreciated being told that company is switching to a 3 day in-person hybrid schedule before having started (was told that I would be working only two days in the office)
People they hire are like children. Management does not care about you. They feed the top reps in the company. Have to be in zoom the whole day. Inbound leads are typically fake.
The team manager lack basic team leadership skills and doesn't care about team's product. The software engineers are assigned tasks with Jira points. Software engineers are blamed if the work is delayed and not allowed to change the original Jira points. The team manager doesn't care about the detail of the task and only care about when it is finished. There are sudden layoffs of Software engineers.

The leadership team was more focused on hiring ""world-class talent"" than retaining the employees that have been loyal to the company/had inherent knowledge of the products and customer base. Most of the world-class talent that had been hired has also left.
Too much change and layoffs going on.
Regular changes in leadership and strategy. Little coaching and development.

- a lot of company leadership shakes up - sometimes direction from Product is slow and hard to gain momentum as a team - priorities seem like they need some reigning in to what makes sense to keep teams moving forward and contributing more towards company goals - a lot of technical debt and legacy systems that need to be removed or migrated - stocks are low in general and vested lower than they were granted and bonuses are lower than promised so far - a lot of red tape and knowledge gaps when attempting to make progress or hunt down issues - still moving several company systems and services into one Angi service which can be hard to navigate when making updates
Company does not care about employees,
Fast-paced environment is not for everyone.
Personal mental attitude is hard to keep up after so many rejections, very hard to overcome former company Home Advisor reputation, change is always happening and would be hard to overcome if one doesn’t like major change often.
The office is big and relatively empty making the environment very quiet with being able to overhear EVERYTHING. The conference rooms are nice but Zoom is still heavily used due to hiring so many remote workers during the pandemic. Unlimited PTO is great but supervisors will often question you or make you feel bad for taking time off, this is totally dependent manager to manager. There is definitely a lack of leadership so even if you can find support from your manager, your manager may not be finding support from their manager. A lot of processes feel clunky and due to lack of support from leadership it makes it hard to update processes. Or if processes are updated, you likely won’t see any appreciation. Expect LATE nights or do not believe their “work-life balance” as that does not exist in the accounting department.
Great great great great great
High turnover rate for sales reps due to difficulty of role. You have to be willing to put the hard work in and have a strong mindset to get the most of the role because the reward is very, very high with an uncapped commission. Top reps are making 300k plus.

I like the benefits but wish the 401k match was higher. Also, sad that they ended the share awards of Angi stock, was a really nice bonus.
Remote work and I preferred on site
Like many tech companies, difficult budget decisions had to be made over the past year. Getting the budget needed to accomplish team goals can be tough.
Still start up like with lots of work to do. Which is also fun to be apart of.

No cons for me to report at this time
• Got nothing much to say - I left prior to them laying off over 1,000 people.
When I was there they changed the comp plan almost every month which is bad because we were getting paid for entirely new things, affecting the way we sell. By the time we learn to maximize revenue on the new plan, they switch it again. If you are not an average or slightly above average rep, you will never make it here. It's a special type of grinding on the phones and for 50% of reps, they cannot hit quota and either quit or get let go. The company is great, but the grind is not for everyone.

Work from home can be challenging.
It's a serious sales role with high earning potential so the expectation is high. some people dont like to work hard and have trouble producing to it.
The same unavoidable frustrations you would face with any company, but overall I don't have any cons.
There is a very heavy workload
Recent CEO change, leadership has no idea what they're doing in terms of hiring. Lay offs of recruiters and other HR positions happened at the end of 2022. But then the company immediately began hiring HR personnel, especially recruiters, in Mexico. Or either associate recruiters. Extremely fishy and alarming how they let go of so many recruiters and HR personnel but then turn around and hire others at a cheaper rate. Cannot retain recruiters due to insane and ever changing recruitment goals. HR is understaffed and over worked, it takes forever for HR to respond and it's been reported that HR staff are working 10+ hour long days. Due to the short staffing in HR, no one knows what the right answer is and that just leads to a ton of confusion on the HR side and on the employee engagement side
- Micromanaging - Predatory sales techniques - slimy
Like many tech companies, difficult budget decisions had to be made over the past year. Getting the budget needed to accomplish team goals can be tough.
Still start up like with lots of work to do. Which is also fun to be apart of.
Leads are recycled and they have all been called multiple times. More like a casino, you might get lucky
Unfair lead distribution leads to impossible working requirements and very little compensation.
Everything. They give sales to the people who live in Indianapolis and use everyone else as disposable secretaries for them. You get screamed at while on the phone with a client so you can't even heat the customer. It's way too much pressure and nonsense for selling contractors ad space. It should have been a fun job but they make it too intense for no viable reason. Just run away. If you don't live in Indy they'll keep you for 6 months tops and then let you go. I left before that because I found something better.
The fast paced, results driven environment in the ad sales department is not for everyone
It’s sales so you’ll always have your good and bad days with trying to sell.
large company and many teams
You are simply a number to this corporation and only seen as competent if you produce unreasonable and tracked expectations productivity. Extremely low pay and lack of respect given the emotional labor and work that is done by the team. Upper management takes advantage of employees by giving false promises for an eventual promotion (that never will happen) if you do more supervisor work - when really they are passing off THEIR work for you to do for free. If you refuse - they blackmail you saying you aren't showing them ""leadership traits"" they want to see and continue to dangle a carrot over your head. I saw this happen to loyal team members for years with no benefit or advancement. At one point, they put a block on letting me and other team members interview for opportunities in other departments because our team had such a HIGH turnover - (due to the management and difficulty of our jobs). Shortly after this, I put in my notice and got a job with a company that actually respected me and my career goals. It was only after I left that I realized how emotionally abusive this company was to its employees.
Not landing every sale we sub.
- Your biggest competition is your own company - They claim you make commissions. You don't. You earn bonuses. Each sales is assigned a point value. If you get enough points, you earn a bonus.
The pace can be very fast on some teams. Generally a good thing, but you better buckle up...

Not allowed to clock in at actual arrival, violating FLSA laws. I was placed on a PEP and then terminated while I was in the hospital having a miscarriage. I provided a heads up and a doctor’s note to my manager, but they claimed it was an “unexcused absence” and a “pattern of absenteeism”. Apparently making 500 cold calls a day is more important than employee lives and health. Was I really supposed to still come in? Run far away and fast, you deserve to work for better people who care about your wellbeing and see you as more than a metric and don’t discriminate based on your health.
-Extremely ambitious and demanding, to the point where there's sometimes too much going on to be able to properly focus on any one goal
Not able to take on jobs due to the lack of Contractors. I was overpromising, and under delivering and that is just not me.
Work from home can be challenging.
It's a serious sales role with high earning potential so the expectation is high. some people dont like to work hard and have trouble producing to it.
None that I have experienced.
can get stressful when sales dont come
Sometimes job hour estimates are way off.
Prospects are cycled through all the sales reps every 2 weeks, so these poor people (our clients) are getting cold called by new sales reps every other day…. You get yelled at A LOT. I’ve seen many of my peers cry at their desk here. (I worked in office and remote). Very high sales quotas, high pressure environment, 150 cold calls a day expectation, micromanagement of daily tasks and activity… Let me put it this way, I got hired with 30 other people for sales reps, and after 9 months of working at Angi only 2 of the 30 reps I was hired with either quit or were fired. Good luck to ya if you want to work here.
Constant changes in compensation, constancy changes in lead quality and sources
I dont have any cons from Angi, if your not driven to win and coachable , its not the place for you, this company has been the best opportunity I have ever had.
You are not trusted on the editorial team. You are micromanaged and must track everything you work on; it seems like you have to prove you are doing work. Nobody assumes the best of you. Your feedback is not acknowledged by leadership. There are no ""wins"" celebrated. Everything is about how you are not working fast enough or good enough. Leadership prioritizes quantity over quality. Speed is most important, but if you publish something with a typo you will hear about it. Editors are consistently given more and more work to do. When you say it's too much, leadership will say ""I don't think it is"" and then wonder why most of their editors have quit over the past 2 years. The only thing editors are tasked with is editing. You're expected to sit down and edit copy for 8 hours a day, with no other tasks. The job is very one dimensional. No opportunity for growth.
Calling 100+ service owners per day, getting hung up on, stress if you don’t hit numbers you could lose your job.
Repetitive, shady practices at time, unreliable customer service
Pretty dismal place to work. Top finance leadership is openly disrespectful to employees. Little to no focus on development. Poor culture around the company aside from select teams with a good manager. Upper management treats every task like the sky is falling. High turnover top to bottom in recent years creates chaos

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NewYork-Presbyterian-Hospital-Reviews-E121522.htm,"Great company to work for
The compensation is good and competitive when compared to other places.
There is a high caliber of physicians, surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists who are knowledgeable, kind, and compassionate. They remind you why you return every day. The pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are some of the most hardworking and humble people I have ever met in my career. The reason why CUIMC is on the map is because of the front-line team.

","I have no complaints with them
I was treated so poorly! I worked there as a new nurse. What hurt the most is the bullying. I gathered the courage to speak out, afraid and embarrassed as I am a reserved person. When I met with the unit managers I explained the situation to them. I explained to them how it was affecting me mentally and asked for their help. I was met with words like, “why are you coming forward now”, etc, etc…these words only widen the wound. They ended the meeting with, thanks for sharing, and they will take care of it. I was not taken seriously. And the next day… I was told by the manager that, as a new grad, I was not meeting the intended expectations and they have to let me go. Just like that! I have never been more shocked in my life (I was so in shock, I stood up and just left without saying anything). Writing this right now still give me PTSD of the entire thing. I never believe this could happen, but it happens. And I experienced it. Management seemed to be able to do whatever they want. Even hurting someone if they care to do it.
In this department, management is left in their positions without being held accountable for years. They're corporate untouchables. You're conditioned to be the problem, ignored, transferred to a different team, and restructured. Pharmacy managers, directors, and VPs don't know how to have face-to-face conversations, and instead breed colleagues who are dishonest, conniving, and gossiping. In turn, the entire bottom line has low morale, spiraling costs, and enough adrenaline to fight a sabertooth tiger. They lost 7 managers in one year, an extremely high turnover rate.
management not very involved, always short staffed, high acuity patients, high nurse turnover
Overall the Benefit are great but they can provide better medical coverage with less out of pocket expense.
-Very traditional corporate structure that will feel conservative compared to other industries -Top heavy organization with layers of management leading to bureaucracy and inefficiency -Career growth and promotions are too dependent on politics and favoritism rather than merit and performance. Some departments have no clear ladder for growth at all -Reactive rather than proactive approach to problem solving -Micromanagement -Promotes staff feedback but ideas are not acted upon or often ignored
No weekend differentials like other hospitals. It could have helped more with short staffing
also lack of actual guidance and support from leadership
Busy need more people to help with patient overload
Working weekends and holidays and management
You are constantly busy doing other little tasks to support your colleagues a level or so above that being hands on is difficult
Had some doozy supervisors and colleagues (literally knives, hair pulling, rolling of eyes) in the past. (Many said it was only the department I was in, management has since changed as well as staffing so it is much better now).
Growth opportunities are hard to come by
patient population can be difficult (underinsured/no insurance)
Extremely demanding and lots of favoritism. Was told by other employees to find a new job and run far away. Some coworkers act like immature children that were bullies and peaked in high school.
New hires with less experience often payed more in order to compete with other companies. Bad workers suffered no consequences. Upper management would never go to bat for workers and just agree to changes from other departments even when it hurt our own.
they are always short on staffing
High volume of work and stressful
no patient exposure since you mainly work with providers
During COVID, didn't feel 100% safe with the fact that they locked all the other entrances. It was also unfair that other locations were allowed to work from home an we had to go to the hospital every day. All MSO departments were hired under one entity, before signing my new contract I researched salary, what they didn't know was I was already looking for credentialing positions, when hr. came back and told me that I was getting I was getting industry rate, I knew that was a lie. I hate when people try to under mind me. Therefore, I had to do what was best for me and my family and leave, you didn't do much for me during COVID, when have of my friends work in healthcare and they were rewarded with different stipends. I reisked my life everyday going into that place and never complained. When it came time to leave everyone moved very funny with me, even blocked me from getting other jobs.
Short staff, some of the managers display favoritism
When they are short staffed instead of offering you a gift card or more money they give food stamp coupons for all the extra work you do .
There is not much staff engagement
Lower end of salary compared to other hospitals, high turnover
Management Tedious workflow Short staff
Management and leadership is awful.
Can be chronically short staffed. Puts a lot more pressure on everyone
Do not expect to move up in your position unless you are dark skinned. They will waste your time with interviews knowing very well that they won’t be hiring you…even though you qualify. Dark skinned managers and supervisors only choose dark skinned people for jobs. You could be here 20 years stuck in the same position and not able to move on…but another person who has only been here 1 year with no experience will be chosen because they are dark. Take a look at the Dhk/Cohen building. almost all dark skinned clerks. At Cornell they don’t do this. The clerks are from different ethnic backgrounds.
Hard to keep growing in company with title, stayed the same for years. Have to go onto field alot even when pregnant or unwell and exposed to all sort of people. Issues with taking time off for years No training
Night shifts were mandatory on the service.
not found any so far
Not much cons working here
Management doesnt support staff regarding concerns
not the best benefits but it is NYSNA
No communication amongst higher management
Patients and their family can be abusive to staff and it just slides through management.
Not a very collegial experience Morale is low amongst staff
Prepare yourself for a life of what feels like slave work. You will get paid bare minimum while management and senior leadership forces you to do their work on top of your own work, which is already more than what should be considered “fair” given the years of understaffing and leadership doing nothing about it. While you have your own job responsibilities, you will be forced/pressured to do more/take on extra work/join more committees/do projects/etc to help make leadership’s life easier while your life becomes servitude. Leadership gets credit for all the hard work you do and gets nice hefty annual raises/bonuses for managing staff well aka you making work work while you get absolutely nothing. Work “above and beyond” as leadership likes to encourage and promote yet when you do, you are not even rewarded with the basic decency of a “thank you.” Reach out to leadership for, you know, leadership and instead you get anything but. You get no insight. No help. Passive aggressiveness. Cold. Distant. Short. Arrogance. Entitlement. You are in the same place you were before reaching out - alone (but now with attitude as if you trying to do your job is somehow burdensome to leadership). You sign up for a job that is supposed to respect your autonomy as a living human yet you get nothing but passive aggressiveness, being dismissed, and usually just blatantly ignored. Leadership has the right to their autonomy but when it comes to your given rights, how dare you ask for PTO/vacation time. Call in sick and be prepared to be punitively guilt-tripped as if being human and getting sick is completely in your control. Ask for some time off and you will find that your emails are not responded to. Your time - your life - is meaningless. Leadership claims respect and support as one of their biggest and most important principles yet be prepared to never feel respected, supported, valued, seen, heard or even the bare minimum - acknowledged. You are treated with no human decency, as if you are cattle to be used and abused. How ironic that a department that is based on promoting mental health, wellbeing, advocacy and support has leadership that thrives off of the downfall of your own mental health and well-being. Sign a contract to work here and you’re signing a contract to be in an abusive and tyrannical relationship. No wonder they changed their slogan “amazing things are happening here.” Abuse is happening here.
The internal staff you have to deal with like doctors and nurses can be condescending and provide a hostile work environment.
No cons, would say N/A
Lower end of salary compared to other hospitals, high turnover
not as many job opportunities
Base compensation is not up to par with other hospitals in NYC.
Maybe provide better directions for new staff
Do not expect to move up in your position unless you are dark skinned. They will waste your time with interviews knowing very well that they won’t be hiring you…even though you qualify. Dark skinned managers and supervisors only choose dark skinned people for jobs. You could be here 20 years stuck in the same position and not able to move on…but another person who has only been here 1 year with no experience will be chosen because they are dark. Take a look at the Dhk/Cohen building. almost all dark skinned clerks. At Cornell they don’t do this. The clerks are from different ethnic backgrounds.

Pay a little lower than average
far from me this time
It is sometimes functioning as a typical corporation.
Low pay and high stress. The work goes unappreciated by human resources they believe we are highly paid which is a delusional thought we are treated poorly and persecuted more than anything it feels like our existence itself bothers HR we are an unfortunate need for them
poor management, they are too busy to care about the wellbeing of staff
None that I can think of
Sometimes understaffed, work long hours
Not a fair place to work
None, it’s a great place to start and stay
I do not have any cons
Delays completing work due to check process.
Nothing every thing was fine
Too much turnover Cliquey staff Management plays favorites Some providers can be petty and difficult to work with
area needs work equipment needs update
A lot of remote work means I don't get to interact with my awesome colleagues as much as I'd like.
Toxic environment, overwhelming job, long hours working
Every place has its Politics
Benefits is removed after 3 months if you are on worker comp or FMLA. Left to get cobra or no health insurance at all
My job wasnt too stressful but there is a lot of stressed out people because of the pressure of hospital environment. Administration can be overbearing. Push woke stuff.
As a companion, you receive your assignment once you get to work and certain patients are dangerous/combative. Even with assigned security to stay with you there have still been incidents.
Time consuming, short deadlines, Turnarund time can be very short sometimes
lack of specialty experience, less attending
I love working there , amazing place
no cons.. good company overall
Staffing is not always great and resources could be better
working as a resident is very challenging
Cliques, other higher paying jobs, not much training
Leadership not as supportive of remote work, does not acknowledge lack of security in NYC and how that effects people wanting to commute
Not much room for growth, managers have complete control of all your growth, horrible hours and no work life balance
Working weekend and holidays and nights. Not much autonomy. Not much flexibility.
None to speak of at the moment
Pay per hour is slightly lower than surrounding areas, but it is competitive with other teaching hospitals in the tri-buroughs.
Sometimes working short, we should get more pay for the work we do
Work weekends and not flexible schedules
I don't like the PTO structure at NYP
Few opportunities to advance. Need to create your own opportunities, which can be difficult.
Poor retention. Non competitive wages
In the outskirts of NYC
Wish there was more growth and more remote options
Will have to float to work on other floors/units.
Nothing at all to say bad
Location. Safety issues in the neighborhood.
Not many cons to share
Favoritism Some upper management experience
Low pay and high stress. The work goes unappreciated by human resources they believe we are highly paid which is a delusional thought we are treated poorly and persecuted more than anything it feels like our existence itself bothers HR we are an unfortunate need for them

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Red-Cross-Reviews-E2707.htm,"People are very friendly, vey cooperative. Best work environment imaginable.
- Coworkers are great - Hard to begin at first with writing, but most can be copied from the official Red Cross language and then reused for different purposes
The work isn’t that hard as the Red Cross expects paid staff to delegate all work to volunteers.
Saving lives! Our donors make the madness almost worth it.
Work from home. Great peers to work with. Very family oriented work place.
Great people, fulfilling work, and supportive workplace
Great company culture. There are culture groups you can join, professional leadership groups based at the national level and regionally, and leadership are generally easy to talk to. It is the first place where I truly loved my job and the people I worked with everyday. If you are okay with staying at the same pay scale and the same position for a long time (3-5 years) before you are even lucky enough to be promoted, then you will thrive here for years.
Decent pay, benefits, pto, company vehicles, paid uniforms
They are very interested in diversity and inclusion.
Set schedule for most part
Working with diverse communities, helping people in times of disaster, leading passionate volunteers.
You're making a huge difference for people across the country. A very rewarding career in that sense. Okay pay and benefits compared to other places of employment.
Helping to educate lifesaving skills to many.
Pays pretty decent with no requirements.
People are great, I like the mission. 401 plan is good. Lots of diversity, good supervisors.
Geninuenly very good people work here, at least in this location

Supervisor was great and got along well. The things the company did I believe in supported for the relief they did for the community.
flexible nice staff friendly helpful
The volunteers are amazing and the mission is unlike anything else.
Enjoy the work environment and atmosphere they create.
Traveling to different venues, and talking to different co-workers and donors every day, was the most rewarding experience. It's a dynamic job with different challenges to tackle every day. You'll find a flexible work schedule and good work-life balance.

","Salaries may not be as competitive if you are looking for top dollar.
- No cost of living increases, bonus, or yearly raises - They do offer 3 hours of PTO per pay period, but only a few holidays a year are off. Last year, I was required to work the day before and after Thanksgiving and Christmas. Why would an office employee need to work on Christmas Eve in a closed office?
Every aspect of the organization if you have a moral compass. This is a great place to work if you feel like you know more than your peers and you’re not afraid to delegate all of your duties to your volunteers. Too heavy management that is so far removed from what is actually going on in the world or what hard work means. This is the most disappointing non profit I’ve ever worked for. Their motto should be—we get paid so we can find volunteers to do our jobs for free. Additionally, the benefits are not that great and the variation in oat ranges for the same job can ve 20k and all depend on your hiring person. HR is useless as are the individuals that work your grants and budgets. No onboarding whatsoever. If you decide to work here I would strongly encourage you to ask how long the last five people who held your position worked there—across the board, only lazy people who like to delegate to volunteers work here.
Executive leadership has no clue!! Talent is leaving this place in droves!!! Employees are penalized because the general public is not donating blood like they did in years past! Instead of making the neccesary adjustments, we are expected to drag donors to the beds kicking and screaming to meet the need. I TOTALLY understand that there are lives at stake, but if you run off all of your talent, then what?? There is NO WORK LIFE BALANCE WHAT SO EVER!! You are expected to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!!! Our lack of adequate equipment is laughable! They have tweaked the incentive program to ensure no one makes it. If I hit all targets but my teammates don't - I am penalized by not getting my incentive. We have teammates who have not got a single target in well over 18 months!
Not being able to see your coworkers face to face.
I have no cons to list working here
Salary and pay scales are top heavy. At the national level people are typically provided a higher pay rate upon entry compared to the people at the regional level working in the field carrying out mission work. You have to be one of the lucky ones to get promoted to a national position or you have to move to a new department in order to get paid more.
Management effiency, hours, travel, late nights, erratic schedule.
Tend to low ball some salaries
This company has favoritism and let's harassment and discrimination slide as well as bullying. If you report issues to HR they will fire you. They only care about the company not the employees.
A constant demand to do more and more with fewer and fewer available resources. The average lifespan for those in this position is hovering nationally at about 1.5 years, and it's because the job WILL burn you out, the work/life balance is next to nill, and the emotional toll is heavy. But the work is definitely worthwhile.
The hardest workers are expected to work harder while the lazy coworkers skate by, doing less than the bare minimum. Inconsistent scheduling Starting at 4:30 am one day, noon the next day. Last minute shift cancellations with replacement hours that don't match your initial shift. Full-time is considered to be 30 hours. Staff are promoted into positions they aren't ready for, leaving others having to pick up their slack.
Lots of heavy physical demands expected and not compensated.
This job can be life consuming.
Understaffed. The pay isn’t competitive, the raises are insulting. The upper leadership doesn’t seem to care about it’s employees, can be stressful trying to compensate for people calling out. New hires and long term employees keep leaving. Long term employees often have repetitive hand injuries.
Email jobs that just sit in meetings pay the most, if you actually touch blood or have to adhere to FDA regulations, you're going to be paid poorly. They say it's a non profit, but there's plenty of profit, it just doesn't go to anyone doing a job seen as ""low class,"" even though during covid these were the only essential jobs. Funny how that works! You'll get bossed around by people who don't know what they're doing who make 2x what you do, then when you clean up their mess you'll get denied a decent raise. Same as anywhere else, really, seems like you have to change jobs once a year or you're leaving money on the table.
Long commute to blood drives for work and different hours every week depending on random scheduling.
Employees and upper management. Everyone was miserable and toxic environment. People were not afraid to throw one another under the bus if it got them out of trouble., employees that were in their 40s-50's still stuck in highschool mentality. What the company did as a whole, vales and their mission was not reflected well with management and the employees.
demanding hard heavy annoying not fun
Pay is lower than averages and you are expected to put in many hours.
I do not have any cons
The base pay isn't great, you will have to make most of your money traveling outrageous distances by abusing the travel reimbursement system they have in place. Shaky leadership doesn't always protect you when things go wrong. So I recommend understanding the company-wide regulations and standards in place.

Not much money goes into the program so you work with what you have
It is volunteer, so no pay. But you get lots of free swag and food at meetings.

Salary is not competitive in the DCS world. Raises are 1.5-3% each year depending on performance. Their programs are antiquated and out of touch with what the mission is for the organization. the ARC is incredibly ineffective and wasteful with their finances. A combination of high turnover (while I was there out of 14 field staff positions, 12 of us were new, and within a year and a half 4 field staff and two senior level employees left. The two senior staff members were from the same position within 5 months of each other. Neither lasting 6 months) and ineffective reliance on volunteers leads to an insane amount of inefficiencies. Additionally, absolutely no work life balance. You'll be working 6+ days per week, 10+ hour days with no additional compensation.

No sick time long hours
Hours, expectations were to work extensively
competitive salary for the position
long hours and shift differential along with travel
You rarely make your monthly bonus. Getting blood donors to actually donate is very difficult. Higher ups don’t care what you have to do, it’s all numbers to them.
A bit unorganized but a generally great culture
Incredibly unrealistic expectations with uneven territories and the inability to adjust accordingly. Management will tell you that YOU are the reason staff members aren't getting paid and that YOU are the reason people are dying. Incredibly disrespectful, constantly bashing their employees, talking about others behind their backs. Encourages you to work weekend hours in order to hit their unrealistic metrics as a SALARIED employee! The lack of a work life balance is not something they want to hear - the exact response will be ""that's the job."" OR if you're really lucky ""Well, it's your job to hit metrics."" Be ready to have your head chewed off by 9:00 AM for the results of the previous days drives - though most of the time it's due to malfunctioning equipment, weather, acts of god - that WILL NOT MATTER! You will still be held for their failures as if they expect you to put a literal gun to someone's head in order to get them to donate. Example: At a brand new blood drive that was set up for success The Red Cross rolled up in a bus that looks like it was an extra in the movie Speed. Clearly old and from the 70's. It could not keep the A/C running due to it being in terrible condition. We ultimately were forced to shut that blood drive down early which disappointed both the new business relationship, but lost the trust of those who took time out of their day to donate. The very next day that rep was ripped by management for having low collection. They know the circumstances, they just don't care. As for how they treat you personally? That is abysmal as well. EXAMPLE: One rep was FORCED to take a PTO day even though they got their tire fixed and still made the drive to Columbia. Once they arrived in Columbia, after rushing to fix their tire, the employee was ambushed in their Columbia office by their absolutely tyrannical management team. This employee was once again FORCED TO TAKE PTO and was banished to their hotel room until the next day when they were ""allowed"" to return to the team. Not even the curtesy to tell them to take their PTO that day and get their tire fixed and enjoy their time at home. - Nope, after rushing to get the tire fixed they still insisted that the individual make the 2.5 hour drive, only to be ambushed and again FORCED TO TAKE PTO. Who does that??? These people. Are they insane? Have they never heard of life-happening? God forbid some emergency happens to you or a loved one because their response might actually be ""that's your mission moment to work harder"" Their pay is essentially non-existent, though it is a non-profit. One employee was clearly being paid less than everyone else. Don't expect equality in pay, territories, or opportunities. THERE'S A REASON THEY HAVE LOST 12 EMPLOYEES IN THIS POSITION IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS! Many just outright quit without having another job lined up due to the level of disrespect and toxicity they endured. One individual literally just walked into the office, dropped of their laptop and phone, and walked out. Never to be seen or heard from again. This puts more pressure on the remaining employees as they have no way of hiring for these now vacant territories, of which there are many. That means more driving for reps to places and business' they don't know to try and plan their blood drives all while still covering their own territory. Their turnover also makes it IMPOSSIBLE for reps to get their true bonuses because they have this brilliant idea of tying all bonus structures to team results. So now employees are overworked, underpaid, with no opportunity to make the bonuses they were promised. If you enjoy mental, physical, and emotional tolls on your health - this could be the job for you! Just don't expect to get much for all that pain.

Overnights (contributes the most to staff turnover). Normal work week often is closer to 50 hours, although much of that will be wheel time (may be pro if you really really want overtime!). Day to day shift start times can vary quite a bit (but guaranteed to have at minimum 10 hours between shifts, unless you explicitly agree to come in with less time between two specific shifts which comes with a 50$ pay bonus.) Training can feel lengthy and too short at the same time (you will NOT be thrown into the deep end), and the ‘classroom’ part is excessively boring.
No retirement plans for longevity
loads of changing priorities, too many yearly metrics to keep up with and respond to disaster events appropriately, no support from other lines of service or management
They expect you to work off the clock and that u use your personal mobile and personal computer for work. They cut on call pay and call in pay. They do not invest adequately in technology. Management allowed unqualified managers and directors to continue to work there until they were called out by staff and were threatened with legal repercussions. They do not pay enough to afford to live in the communities they serve.

-Micromanagement to the 100th power -No work-life balance -Management is backstabbing & sneaky -No appreciation shown for staff -Absolutely zero growth -Pay is awful (working OT is the only way to make real money) -Data Management Dept is a revolving door
None at the present moment.
Software and tools are laggy and errors and delays will add considerable time to projects. They offer a bonus system based on 7 criteria and it is impossible to meet all criteria, so do not be lead to think you will make bonuses.
Company has a way of getting in it's own way at times.

Depending on which program you support, there are many opportunities for networking, growth, and funding for professional development. Potential for flexible and hybrid work environment. Potential for good pay. Some solid benefits and perks.
good start for entry position
- Great people to work with. All genuinely helpful. No competition because evaluations /raises are not by performance. Friendly environment. Makes work tolerable. Real team work. - Management /leadership is awesome in my department. - Stable position - Work hours (for dayshift) are great. Overtime is available if you want. - Work-life balance (despite the over time, but you earn extra comp hours from there and use for your vacation). Every department has their own vacation policies/flexibilities. - Hourly rate is higher than most. - Work is repetitive, but patient cases make it interesting. - Work is directly connected with patient care, thus rewarding experience you see first hand. - More contact and communication with clinical staff - RNs, Coordinators, Residents and attendings. - Unionized position = job protection and contract negotiations. - Get a pension after vested for 5 years.

","We are short-staffed sometimes but every hospital is.
UCSF is a hard place to work, with a combination of low pay, clicks of people and some really, really poor colleagues, who have somehow managed to get employed and will now use their protected status (basically older women, with phantom medical issues) so they CANNOT be fired. There is an increase in union activity- which is actually making things worse, as there is basically a fear of taking any action against a poorly performing team member. 20% of the staff do 80% of the work, bullying is rampant, there is a lack of training, poor systems, zero incentive to improve anything and promotion is based on favoritism- which has a strong lean toward rewarding people for ""paying their dues"" and staying UC for a long time. This promotion favoritism is in combination with favoring white, middle class, college educated, English first language, 50+ year olds with management roles (note- some Asians manage to get those also, but really few who aren't those two racial groups). If you want to get into the pension, ""stay forever,"" not learn or grow, have your skills plateau, expose yourself to bullying, and be paid far less than you are worth- UCSF is the place for you! If that is the goal- then make sure you get into a union role, pay your dues, don't learn anything, document bullying and hold on for the ride to retirement doing as little as possible!
There is a lot of bureaucratic red tape that can also make advancing difficult. HR is often more concerned with protecting the institution over the employees. The institution itself prides itself on diversity and equity, but in practice, does not always live up to these principles in its treatment of employees. Also, SF is very expensive, and it can be costly to commute to the office. Health care options are not ideal for out-of-state employees.
Pay is not that great
- Short-staffed. Busier workflow. Increased overtime needed. - High turnover because people live farther and want to work closer to home. - Growth in the field depends on how young the leadership staff is. Generally slower. - No steps to distinguish experience amongst bench CLSs. - Technical growth/knowledge can be stagnant, especially when in the same department, and unless you are a higher CLS doing more projects. - Face pace environment can be very stressful. - Less money to take home: contributions are to the Union dues and to pension (but must stay at least 5 years to get it) and health insurance.
Micromanaging bosses Overloaded work schedule Toxic work environment in some departments If you encounter a difficult boss, there isn't much you can do except leave to another department. Most of the time upper management will side with the people who have been in the department the longest. Also, it is hard to move up in your career due to career tracks. The best option is to leave your job and go to private companies or another department if you need to get a better paying job. The pay offered by many departments for administrative officers is below market rate.
room for growth is a bit limited
like all RA positions, it's a stepping stone job to stay in for 2 years or so, and low paying
At times stressful and can be hierarchical though better than some universities
Need to be proactive in your own learning.
Nothing if you have a support tive manager/supervisor
pay is low relative to cost of living
In my field, each research laboratory can be very different and its work life culture even if it’s all a part of one university. That being said the University likes to extend its control over you whenever possible. My boss that I directly report to is amazing, dealing with the University’s bureaucracy is not. For instance, my boss brings in millions of dollars of funding for our research. This money also pays my salary. The school does not help him obtain the money, but they sure do take that instant 18% off of every grant just to start. Then on top of that, while my salary comes from money that my boss went and got himself that they already took their share of… They then implement pay caps on my job position. Even if my boss wanted to pay me more, he can’t because the university will not allow him to even though the university does not pay my salary from their funds. This is important to note because the pay cap on job positions is standardized across the entire state. So people living in Fresno or in Davis get the same salary as I do living in San Francisco. There’s no cost of living adjustment.
From the senior Directors/management/administration down, they are frequently short-staffing us, eliminating positions and not hiring when we are desperately short staffed for nurses, and gradually expecting more from us with less resource. And all the while receiving huge bonuses and raises for themselves.
Long commute if you live outside of San Francisco
Commute if you are in parnassus campus, pay is good but not enough compared to similar positions in industry
Lots of meetings that don’t seem to go anywhere
Little support from management, slow processes to make change or get answers
Difficult to make changes to protocols, wide range of work ethics
Too dependent on consultants. Lots of base-lining to other universities before understanding what makes UCSF unique.

UCSF has struggled to retain faculty post-pandemic. Many leave for start-ups or tech companies, which means grad students and post docs get left in a lurch. While there are many brilliant and kind PIs, there are also PIs who only seem to care about building their own personal brand so they can get ahead in science, and they will leave a trail of burnt-out trainees in their wake.
Can be a bit disorganized and inefficient at times; however, this is common at most places.
Low pay compared to industry for scientists. Not surprising for academia, but worth noting.
The pay is low as everywhere in academia. You must live a relatively frugal lifestyle while working a high-skill job which can feel demoralizing.
quite demanding as far as work/life balance
N/A, the program is great
Nursing continuing education is neglected Residents are coddled and take priority Managers are purely told to focus on the budget, therefore not making them patient-centered or advocates. They are quick to scrutinize, criticize, and reprimand instead of offering coaching. No clear steps to advance to Clinical Nurse 3
Cost of living is not scaled appropriately in the UCs. You will struggle to live in the bay with this pay.
High cost of living in San Francisco
High turn over rate and there is a hiring freeze
Salaries tend to be low for cost of living.
slow pay raises - not enough to live comfortably in Bay Area
None that I can think of
poor salary as compared to the market.
Consultants interrupt with the FTEs
Some managers are horrible, some employees are horrible, and with some employees being union, it's hard to get rid of a bad employee. There's a lot of disorganization and decentralization so it's hard to find information. Actually, it's ridiculous how hard it is to find basic information. Because different units operate like fiefdoms, there are a lot of duplicated efforts and inefficiencies. Their tech systems are old or non-existent, which is shocking, depending on what unit you're in.

the commute and location to park can be difficult
Sometimes long hours with no overtime
Performative and will overwork you
The annual pay is low living in San Francisco
Salary may not support living within the city, so often leads to long commute times
Terrible pay. A PhD researcher with 5 years post-degree gets paid LESS than a lab manager, and as much as people doing janitorial/custodian/groundskeeping services (I am not exaggerating, just google ""uc annual wage report"", it's public information). In my case, my PI earns 7x what we earn as postdocs. Inequality across the workforce is huge, the region is crazy expensive and unaffordable.
micro manager would be better if management took courses on how to manage staff without hovering.
political correctness, hard work, writing grants and publishing
none there is no negative
Expensive city, Good Accommodation can be difficult to find
toxic and unorganized management, very low pay
- None that I can think of

sometimes lack of training. you learn as you go
No atonomy due to teaching hospital

Politics can be difficult to navigate
Labor union issues Issue within the employees
UC administration has a history of attacking employee benefits and undermining labor partnerships.
Pay isn't the most competitive.
The salary is really low compared to regional based salary
low pay for postdoc in research
The chief of Staff at the Office of Diversity and Outreach needs to know how to actually manage staff. The person in this position should be able to lead (not let her title get in her head) and provide support, positive constructive criticism (or sometimes praise staff for a job well done!) , and motivate staff to do and be better. I've witnessed at least SIX people resign due to her micromanaging and lack of management skills, and that's within my 4 years of working there. Only staff that reports to her knows what I'm talking about here (lol). Some managers don't really care - and the one person I thought would advocate for me also sided with her- because of course, she is the Chief of Staff (very disappointed with him.) Even with the pay and benefits being really great- I had to quit for the sake of my mental and emotional health. So not worth having to deal with her daily!
Seem to struggle financially, makes me concerned about future.
No cons so far. Really enjoy it
Since COVID, departmental organization needs improvement
short staffing, night/day shift rotations, large corporation politics
Can be inconsistent between departments and management.
Very stressful at times. Can have overwhelming amount of work to do in a day with tight deadlines.
Can likely command a higher salary in private sector
None that I can think of
pay is not well in the most expensive city in the US
I often found staff were treated like second-class citizens compared to doctors.
Seniority has more weight than merit
Accommodation bad Campuses are all over the city
Salary, too much time spent attending meetings or writing grants
Parnassus is on a steep hill
Salary low High COL area
Salary could use some work low key
Salary could use some work low key
It's a San Francisco based employer, take that into account in terms of culture.
Salary was far too low to make payments for grad student loans and afford rent/food/etc in expensive San Francisco and surrounding area. I lived 1.5hr commute away via public transport and still could not make ends meet.
-Not ethnically diverse -Not a lot of female faculty -Expensive city with high rent prices
There is no institutional support, unlike a faculty position, this position does not inherently have institution space or salary support. Therefore the support of the researcher is dependent upon the PI/faculty member they are associated. This leads to variable experiences.
pay is not great at all
Locations--They were forcing us to work a hybrid schedule even though we could perform our work remotely. It's difficult to move up steps to earn a higher salary There's definitely a hierarchy Not much growth opportunities
Rent is expensive in SF.
being a resident per se
None - great place to go to grad school

Cool people, interesting work, and understanding management. Great way to get clinical experience.
Observe inner workings of patient-physician interactions, and exposure to medical terminology
Had a gap in work experience as I stayed at home with my small boys and had a hard time getting an employer to take my job search seriously until this company, I thank God for them. Positive scholastic environment is encouraging and flexible hours are essential for family, I don't think I could be at a better job right now, even tho I attained my B.S. in 2015 I feel this position fits my life best for now! Drama free, I feel valued and take my responsibilities seroiusly, so honestly I searched for a position for many months and flexibility in hours is hard to find with online jobs even post Covid, thank you Scribeamerica! Given advancement opportunities to interview multiple times but I chose to decline right now my life is too busy, will consider at later date because I would like more responsibility and pay.
- Work from home - Company provided laptop and monitor - Most scribes are really nice - Can be chill, depending on which doctor you work with
You'll get paid once or twice for your trouble
For anyone needing clinical experience scribing is a great way to get it! Also a true insight to what medical providers do on a daily basis.

It was a great way to learn medical terminology and meet different types of medical providers and learn about the field more in general. I highly recommend this position to any pre-health students.
Learned a lot as premed student.

Nice Providers, very supportive and willing to teach
Excellent job exposing young prospective health care workers to multiple different types of health care providers. Competitve wage where I was working.
-good for entry level medical experience -room for growth within the company -upper management is helpful (when you have good managers) I worked as a medical scribe for a year then became a traveling project manager for 3 years. The medical scribing experience was beneficial. Most people I worked with went on to pursue excellent careers in medicine or other non-medical professional roles. I was able to work in Emergency, Hospitalist, Pediatric, Family, OBGYN, and Behavioral health specialties. So they do offer a lot of medical experience. Also if you take on upper level roles within the company they do pay for your travel expenses as well as your stay, everywhere you go. They offer decent benefits if you decide to become full-time staff with them. I had a good experience for the most part but the pay was just entirely too low.
Decent to get foot in the door for clinical experience

Schedule flexibility, make many connections
Long before COVID-19 hit, I worked for ScribeAmerica in a fully remote role. The HQ is located in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, while I'm based in California. It was my first experience working fully remote, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Luckily, the entire business structures around providing a distributed work force across the country, i.e. providing scribes for hospitals, emergency rooms, and doctors everywhere. So ScribeAmerica had the whole ""working without a physical office"" thing down pat. The work is fulfilling in that you're providing a vital service to alleviate a severely stressed industry even before the pandemic. The work-life balance afforded by being able to do everything that I do from home means cutting a 3+ hours per day commute out of my daily life, and thus making me more productive than ever. The best part is the team and the people I work with. Talented, passionate, and professional to the utmost. And since most came from the medical field, you find very smart and highly educated co-workers in every conceivable level of the company.
","I do not have any concerns with ScribeAmerica.
Other providers aren’t as welcoming and consider you as only an assistant to them. This job is not a career choice, but rather a means to grow in the healthcare field. If you’re not learning, working a minimum wage job is pointless. Chief scribes were constantly changing. I was there for 9 months and had 4 different chief scribes.
Pay is awful and hiring process takes forever
you basically do an entire medical crash course without medical pay - although it's definitely above minimum wage.
Very poor management and communication. You are treated as an active medical student which means your time may not be respected and the work/life balance can be quite poor. This is not the position to work if you are studying for the MCAT. Below living wage pay.
Not really ideal as a part time job. The minimum requirement was to scribe for a doctor 2 full days a week which I found hard to schedule classes around. It is a lot of work which could be manageable but it is a struggle for the doctor who may need a second or third scribe to fill in other days for a part timer.
Terrible pay and terrible hours. In order to get the job they make you take a whole course for weeks which you must pass, all to use about a quarter of the information that they test you on. Even after that, there's no guarantee that you get the job unless you pass the ""training"", which consists of them putting you in the line of fire with little to no support. You basically have to figure out most things on your own within a few shifts, and if you can't get it they kick you to the curb. So you could spend months taking the course, trying to get the job, and then not getting it. All that is besides the minimum wage and super long hours that they offer you after requiring a lengthy training process. It is ridiculous and exploitative of the fact that pre-med students will do almost anything to get the experience necessary to get into medical school. If possible, look to scribe for a private practice instead of this trash company.
No communication, Lack of resources/people who knew answers, pay was horrible, took 5 months to actually start getting hours, in the beginning you didn't get hour right away, manager changes every couple months and they all had different ways of communication/discipline.
The physicians all had vastly different preferences The physicians would often speak at a whisper and expect you to hear and be frustrated when you didn't Low pay
It can be very fast-paced and might take a while for you to get used to scribing. Some doctors are not very nice and understanding and they can even be rude sometimes. Talk to your manager to change the doctor if you need to.
Absolutely not a career. Also, recent changes to billing in the ER specifically have made work as a scribe feel a lot less important and I think it shows.
Lower pay, horrible hours. Some employers will ask you work minimum 10 hour shifts 3x a week which is insane as a college student.
My tech issues were unresolved for 6 months but now that's fixed I am thrilled, EMRs can be so problematic, pay is slightly low considering its online I can't complain too much and its 4 more $ than my states minimum wage.
- Management is terrible, unless you get lucky in your placement, super corporate, total lack of empathy, robotic, no leadership skills - The company lies to you during the interview about whether the job is full/part time and what duties you will most often be responsible for - The schedule is never correct, and the use of two different scheduling apps (Workday & Humanity) makes it difficult to understand, take time off, etc. - If a doctor complains, they put the blame on you, not on themselves - Lack of communication - No room for growth - they string you along, interview you for promotions, talk about new opportunities, but it is just a carrot at the end of a stick - There is bonus pay for admin duties, but if you need hours it's easier for them to just have you scribe, so that is what you will do 100% of the time - You are stuck wherever they want to place you - If you are unhappy, good luck trying to get anyone's attention, they will just look for reasons to fire you - Management does not look for good fit and common interests when placing scribes with providers, they only go by availability - 50/50 chance that you will like any given provider - The equipment they send you is basic and cheap
This company is actually a scam - they profit from keeping people on the payroll, using certain remote work tools, and enjoying their tax breaks. I was hired twice - once for $11 an hour and once for $17 an hour. Doing the same job. I had so many supervisors, but not a single one could tell me what was going on and why it took 4 months after completing ScribeU to be assigned to a site. The root of all my problems with the company is that no work was available, even though they reached out to me with an offer. My manager told me that an outside company sends blind leads for new hires, negotiates pay, and then ScribeAmerica is notified and you start after signing with that 3rd party and getting a background check through yet another business. They sent me a laptop/monitor/mouse/headphones, all arriving on different days in different packages, but I had not been assigned a work site. Then they expected me to take time to get a drug test in a town 400 miles away, because that was the closest LabCorp location to me. When I reached out to my manager, it took 2 weeks for her to find out that I could go to the local walk-in clinic and get a drug test AND a COVID vaccine, because my site required it -- I was 100% remote. They had no idea I had ever been previously hired until I informed my manager after 4 months of employment. The entire operation stinks to high heaven.
ScribeAmerica takes advantage of the fact students are seeking clinical experience… therefore the pay is unbelievably awful. Management was terrible as well as they rarely prepared us well for new positions. They also made you feel terrible if you needed to call out of work for any reason.
Very low pay with a lot of hours
Long hours (but it's medical, so yknow), quick crash course going in which may be a steep learning curve, must be efficient.
- pay doesn't match the responsibilities we have
Very low salary. Work will burn you out very quickly.
not many cons for this job
Rough. Low pay. Doctors disrespect you
After my interview I had to wait 3 months to hear back and after training I have heard nothing back after 3 more months
no movement, they will hire a chief scribe with no experience and pass up other individuals, no possibility for pay increase
Low pay for somewhat stressful job
Providers can be nasty and rude and office staff can treat you badly because you aren't directly employed through the office.
They are very unorganized and wait times to work are outrageous which, in turn, creates a lot of turnover.
Low wages, burn out, low staffing
only made $10 per hour
schedule flexibility is not in their wheelhouse for some people
Hours, management, always changing schedule
-Minimum wage at the beginning of your career
Terrible communication and no structure with quitting
low pay, corporate rigmarole to get compensation for things like parking
- pay - no benefits
Very busy for how little the pay is... not much structure in my department
No easy transfers from fulltime to part time
wish was paid more for the amount of work done
Terrible management, hard to get shifts if you need extra
expects you to work full time as a student, long hours
Pay is awful and you can work with some less than desirable doctors who do not want you around.
the pay was a bit low
can be pretty fast paced
Pay was not worth the work.
pay is low for the amount of information you have to know pertaining to your assigned specialty
Pay sucks Hours are bad Flexibility nonexistent
Not consistently scheduled with same doctors Requires you to commit 20 hours/week or 3 shifts a week Shifts are absurdly long for a student, anywhere from 8-12 hours long
Long hours. Lack of flexibility.
Pay, PTO, benefits were suboptimal
Other scribe companies pay more
Expected to do a lot for minimum wage
only made $10 per hour
The hourly rate is low, hours are long (barely any breaks, long hours standing), and scheduling is not consistent. I personally know a coworker who was hired full time but was not scheduled for over a month. Personally, I was hired part-time and there are weeks that go by where I am not on the schedule. From the time you are hired to the time you are actually training on-site can be over a month and a half.
it’s impossible to get a shift covered at all. the hours are absurd, the shift says it starts at 6am but in order to have the noted prepped for the doctors or the pagers done in time you must get there 45-60 minutes prior which for me meant getting up at 4:30am and not being off work until 2pm. the management is incredibly unprofessional, there are constant last minute changes. it seems my supervisor is spread too thin or does not know how to handle her job in a proper way. underpaid for the amount of time and stress this job induces, you might as well just volunteer.
Management tries to make you busier for appearances rather than you doing what you need too
Sometimes poor communication, unexpected changes, and site relocation.

The pay of the position is the only reason I would leave.
Did not offer good pay for position
-Low pay -Inconsistent scheduling -Fulfillment is location-based
the pay was a bit low
can be pretty fast paced
- steep learning curve - mostly an individual job (can be pro or con) - assigned specialty is based on availability - minimum wage job; no pay raise unless you train another scribe or take on administrative responsibilities - not always understanding of schedule changes
The pay is poor- especially for the amount of training required
Your medical experience will depend on the type of physician you are placed under. If the physician is willing to teach, you will learn. Otherwise, you will just become a human typewriter. Switching between doctors/specialties is not as easy as they claim because they are understaffed, the turnover rate is high, and sometimes there are no other cross-trained employees. When you are promoted, there is not much of a pay raise, but your workload increases by a lot.

Pay is very very low (experience may make up for it).
Sometimes poor communication, unexpected changes, and site relocation.
Less pay, even with experience.
Pay is pitiful, company is overrun with middle management
Atmosphere at this location is very hit or miss. The pay is very low for how much work you do. Do it for the experience if you have high financial flexibility. I was part time was mostly scheduled full time hours.
To be clear, I never actually worked for them (for reasons explained below), but hopefully this is an isolated incident instead of the norm. I ignored all the negative reviews and interviewed for the QDS (Quality Documentation Specialist) position. After a couple weeks, I was scheduled for an interview. A couple of days after that, I was informed - via email - that I was being offered the job. I completed the steps to accept the offer as soon as I received it. I was then told I would receive information via email from HR within 3-7 business days. I even sent a thank you email to my interviewer because she was so nice, and I was grateful for the opportunity. That's something I NEVER do. Three or four days later, received an email from the interviewer stating that my job - the job I was OFFERED and ACCEPTED - was filled. I was then offered a DIFFERENT job within the company, that by all accounts was much more stressful, for the same amount of pay. I should have paid attention to all the negative reviews, but tried to give them a fair shake. This is the first time I've ever experienced a bait-and-switch while applying for a job; needless to say it feels like a huge slap in the face. Was this part of the plan all along, or is there just a complete lack of internal communication? Do they intentionally overhire, due to the high turnover? Whatever the reason, this was the worst hiring experience I've ever been a part of.
I think it definitely depends on what clinic or hospital you are working in. I worked full-time over summers in different IM or FM clinics which was a little more laid back. During school, I worked part-time in the ER which was significantly more stressful. Hours could vary a lot and I pulled a lot of unexpected 12 hour shifts when it was originally 8 hours, which can be difficult with school. A drawback more specific to my location were the politics, many providers made their scribes uncomfortable with certain remarks and it was a reason a lot of people did not stay for very long.
Poor pay for responsibility and workload.
Pay is unlivable, I was literally the lowest paid employee in the entire hospital, housecleaning was making more than me. Management would not only refuse raises, they took a raise away after a year while asking me to still train. Martina and Angelica Savage were some of the most toxic people Ive ever met. 0 opportunities for advancement. Leave within 6 months, once you feel confident about what medicine is, do not stick around, they will run you to the ground, do not give them 2 years. Management isnt even local, based in Florida, just siphoning capital away from the state it works in. This company will not be around for much longer.
Management sucks, they dont know your schedule and they aren't reasonable
Work can be taxing. Must be okay with standing for up to 12 hours at a time and typing multiple thousands of words a day.
The pay is very low for entry level and mid-level positions, roughly only $33K for the project management position I had. Most other companies would be paying way more for project management roles and more for scribe roles. With scribing you start at $10 here but with other companies start you at $16-$18. It's great for part time if you're in school and you just need experience but you won't get paid a livable wage until you move up in the company.
Pay doesn't compensate for work
Pay doesn't compensate for work
low pay, long hours but probably b/c I was in the ER
Low pay, overworked, poor management, and unclear rules.
-No cons at the moment
ScribeAmerica is definitely profiting off the hard work of premeds knowing we cannot get better experience elsewhere.
Low pay No benefits for part time
Long hours in the emergency room
This company preys on college students wanting to get ahead in their careers. But $10 is lower than most fast food chains. Management is also mostly college students.
Long shifts, extended periods of down time
I mean, there's always negatives about working from home. You get stir crazy from the lack of adult conversations. Little face to face interaction means you don't develop the type of work relationships that one's used to in a professional environment. High turn-over rate due to the nature of the business means you're almost always working with different group of people from different silos of the business regularly. The medical/healthcare business is low margin, high stress industry.

Co-workers are great, decent benefits
I loved my coworkers and patients. My clinic manager was solid and very good to work with.
Lots of PTO offered, decent benefits, so much to learn, excellent hands on patient care experience
overall good comp plan although not keeping up with industry ramp-up of base salaries and losing some good people because of that.
It’s very rewarding, most of the patients are outstanding, and you become a family with your coworkers.
Qualifies Supervision is provided to me for free. The work is a mix of counseling, education and case management. My manager is great and the other social workers are supportive. It is very independent and flexible work. If my kid is sick I can do charting or training from home. There are great benefits! The company or different reps will buy lunch quite a bit.
Job is fairly easy, but I love the flexibility and generous PTO. They also have parental leave- 4 weeks paid 100%. Makes an average job with average pay worth it.
Good pay, especially for the area. Flexibility with advance notice, great career advancement incentives and tuition assistance program
Remote work and great benefits. Room for grow and development

Work with people who act like a team making hard days much easier. All clinics work differently, but we are open 6 days a week. Off on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Days. Also off on the day of inclement weather. There are opportunities for overtime at the home clinic or other clinics. I work three days a week and make my 40 hours (with an extra hour or two of over time). They offer tuition reimbursement after your training period is over and provided you are on good status. They also offer other types of reimbursement such as mileage if you decide to pick up a shift at a different clinic, and you can get reimbursed for CPR classes or for taking the certification exam through BONENT.

The Cash Accounting team had a wonderful management team from our supervisor to our director. We had flex time. That removed a lot of stress when worrying about being a few minutes late. The pay was and benefits were very competitive. The cost for benefits was quie goo for todays market too. The office even had covered parking which helped in those hot summer months
Simple, concise, direct to the point
Specialization in life saving procedure.

The role is fully remote.
The techs are great but the manager ms are horrible people. On more than one occasion I have been screamed at and told I was stupid , I have been targeted for doing exactly what everyone else has been doing and no one else gets mistreated.
Getting to know patients and families. Co workers
Amazing benefits. More PTO than you can use. It doesn’t matter that holidays come from your PTO bank. How many companies start you with 23 days of vacation?? Subtract 6 holidays and you still have more than 3 weeks vacation. After 1 year you get 26 days. If they simply didn’t give us those extra PTO days in our bank and gave us the holidays separate, people would not complain about 3-4 weeks of vacation time in year 1. I’ve been here over 5 years and never take all my days. They carry over into the next year as well. I’m also not sure where the complaints about Health Insurance come from. The employee premium is very low for a deductible of only $500. If you’ve ever ran or managed a business, you’d know how good the benefits really are here. Also lots of opportunity for growth. Ideas are taken serious and if you put in the work, it does not go unnoticed.
Good benefits/good team mates/ good management

","Healthcare setting can have a busy schedule
-They hire you for a clinic and then they keep adding and adding clinics. The number of patients you are responsible for then becomes over-whelming. Very similar to a consulting position but without the mileage and pay. -Multiple layers of management involved in telling employees what to do, very top heavy with people who have never worked a day alongside a clinician. Typically they have multiple TEAM calls and they are sitting at home in their sweatpants telling us how bad we are doing. -No, none, work-life balance. They just don't care, period. -Management has taken away the clinic manager's ability to make any decisions about their clinics. -Dietitians will never have time to build any rapport with patients or co-workers because they change the clinics you are covering at least once a year. -no support in the clinic, management works from home.
Social workers are spread very thin. We have high caseloads consisting of very ill, often indigent people. Many have issues that require a substantial amount of time which we never had available. I was afraid to ever take a real vacation because of my workload. You could never get any real coverage, just some basic ""you can call so and so in my absence"" but most of your work would be waiting for you when you returned, not to mention a ton of new work piled on top and sticky notes all over your computer and desk, so you'd essentially feel punished for taking time for yourself and your family. The doctor always wanted me to work with patients who were depressed, but I had little time to do any real therapeutic work with anyone. It seemed the main goal of the company was to keep patients with the ""good"" insurance happy and prevent them from leaving your clinic, make sure the numbers looked good and that patients were using the compan pharmacy and refilling their meds regularly. Was it all about money? Sure seemed so. I had to leave and find work that not only didn't drain me but didn't leave me with a strong sense of the icks.
Underpaid for work expected Frequent shift changes due to constant understaffing (pay your techs more for what they do and maybe you won’t always be so short staffed) Expect patients like you’d see in an urgent care or ER- it may be a clinic, but dialysis is considered life saving medicine, you will have patients who have the right to dialysis even if they do everything in their power to stop themselves from getting healthy- including treating their healthcare staff pretty badly. Patients have verbally and physically abused techs at times and it can still be very hard to get protective measures put in place for staff. That said, some of the patients are also the greatest people you will ever meet and you get to have a real relationship with them because you see the same patients every other day.
PTO first 5 years isnt great. Renal pharma team being asked to take on a lot now with AZ collaboration - 4 products to know and support well is a big ask for a sales organization.
Long tedious fast paced hours. I sometimes had to stay to clean the water system which would take hours at times.
When I go on vacation I have a social worker cover for emergencies, but I have the same amount of work I must do in the month, even if I am out for two weeks. Sick days are grouped with PTO, which can be good or bad. There is extended sick leave if you are sick over 5 days that comes from a different pool. The case load for full time is high (130-155). I split my time between two clinics. The clinic that is not my home clinic can change to even out caseloads in the area.
Depending on location, dietitians sometimes end up traveling quite a bit to provide coverage to more rural areas.
Long hours, early mornings, often short staffed, can be very stressful at times.
Work can be repetitive sometimes

Pay is no where near competitive
Low pay for what you do No work life balance
- we’ve had multiple managers come through our clinic and even when they want to be supportive, they aren’t given the resources to help keep our clinic staffed. It makes it seem like patient safety is not a priority to the upper management because they are fine with us running a full clinic while being severely understaffed. - our schedules are given out inconsistently, where one week we got it the Friday before the week the schedule was for - was hired for the nurse role but used as a tech for weeks when I should’ve been getting trained because of how short staffed we are

Lots of changes. We’re going “global” yet processes and policies are not in place.
Long hours for little pay
Disclaimer: My comments only relate to the corporate services group. Fresenius is a large international company, patient care is handled by different organization. Unpleasant and demotivating workplace for analysts and engineers. Most people who had a choice have moved on to better opportunities. Security operations have been off-shored.
Where do I even begin? Noncompetitive pay and benefits for the area yet somehow a few managers think we are paid too much. There are no opportunities for growth. The internal processes do not make any sense. They prevent things from getting done in a timely manner. Additionally, there are some who interfered and meddled in our work using the terrible processes to justify doing such. This drove a good engineer and project manager both to the breaking point.
Not always open for graveyard
Poor staffing due to shortstaffed
When training, coworkers make you do the dirty work (cleaning machines, stocking, and more) while they sit on their phones. Not enough pay for the amount of work. The job wasn’t bad at first. The patients were kind and working wasn’t hard. It was a lot to learn, but i grasped it quicker than usual (they said). Now, it’s depressing. All my coworkers do is talk about quitting and how it sucks. They talk crap about eachother to me. I can’t imagine what they say about me. They fight over who has to train me because my teacher is hardly ever there. It is embarrassing sitting there watching people argue bc they don’t want to watch over you the next day.

I am actively planning my exit as I type and wish the patients and staff the best because we deserve better…
Constantly calling biomed for machines to get repaired for the following week and nothing being done come Monday. Constantly being given only small nitrile gloves and vinyl gloves of every size. The vinyl gloves are just a needlestick waiting to happen. Many times you will feel like the forgotten middle child. You can do everything the PCT can do, and you can also do some things the RNs can do such as giving medications and cvc care. So be prepared to be busy. Recently removed weekend differential. Although not a lot, it was an incentive to work weekends.
Company incentivizes or penalizes nurses to keep patients in center for treatment. This means for bad nurses, they won't call 911 or deliver higher levels of care when it could mean hospitalization. In order the keep center numbers high they also allowed known patients with Covid to come in for dialysis knowing it could comprise the entire unit full of patients. Some who were on the transplant list and could get covid when they are trying to stay healthy in case they get a donor match. When I spoke up about my concerns I was pulled into a manager meeting were the director was hostile and tried to use intimidation to get me to fall in line. I took a new position elsewhere for double pay and in a safe medical care environment instead.
DEI is BS..they need to focus onhealth care, not the flavor of the month
Pay is way below average
Long hours. Pay is not competitive for most of the staff and raises don't keep up with the rate of inflation. Repeatedly asked to do more with less
Only 3% 401k match. Poor PTO structure which includes Sick days. Starting with 15 days.
None really to say currently
No cons. I would never return to to Fresenius
low wage, poor yearly increases, for profit
employees are never given a chance to provide input whenever there are changes in clinics that will affect the employees
Hard to promote without a degree

Heavy workload and always short staffed
For me the only CON was the long 40 mile commute, which went away when we started working from home due to COVID19. I loved working at home but it probably helped in the decision to move the department overseas
To many questions being asked
Call. Long work days, being on call
Expectations are too high for case load numbers Case managers are expected to provide mental health counseling in addition to daily tasks. Poor organizational communication High turnover
Unrealistic Goals. Extremely Stressful. Phones ring nonstop. High Turnover rate.
This is a horrible place to work.
company top heavy, micromanage time from off site. Try to make it one size fits all
Some of the communication from top is too sugar coated. It’s not transparent when we know what they’re really saying without saying it.
Lots of paperwork/ Lots of documentation/ short staffed in some departments
Constantly understaffed, no leadership, favoritism, Retaliation
Some legacy thinking can make progress slow.
Long hours. Pay is not competitive for most of the staff and raises don't keep up with the rate of inflation. Repeatedly asked to do more with less
Only 3% 401k match. Poor PTO structure which includes Sick days. Starting with 15 days.
Pressure to enroll patients in the company's pharmacy.
Little room for career growth/promotions
None really to say currently
No cons. I would never return to to Fresenius
low wage, poor yearly increases, for profit
employees are never given a chance to provide input whenever there are changes in clinics that will affect the employees
Wish I got paid more
Expensive insurance Long work hours Short breaks

Up until 2022, the Company culture was great. Employees cared for and about each other, you could trust that the company and ""family "" were looking out for everyone's best interest. The Atlanta campus is modern and beautiful.

They are offering fiber in allot more areas. They just recently started offering mobile service. For the first year and a half I made a comfortable living doing something I was very good at. And I took alot of pride in that.
Great place to work at
Work life balance Internal Career Growth Unlimited PTO
Decent pay, $18/hr, people are kind
No micromanagement. Work from home availability. Benefits are good. Requesting time off is easy and you don't have to deal with trying to butter up your manager for some vacation days, its all done through an app. Company works with you when trying to get promoted or move to new role. They will get you with other managers in other departments prior to applying to new job so truly see if its a fit. I haven come across a manager yet that hates their life and wants to power trip. As long as you are actually trying they are patient.
Earliest shift is 7am and the lastest ends at 8pm. Mom-Fri with weekends off as well as holidays. 192 hours of.PTO per year,.great people great leaders

Great family culture, able to advance in my career, and grew in responsibility and leadership abilities.
Great work environment easy supervisor support
Great culture -privately owned, so not just about bottom line. Really care for employees and you can see and feel that everywhere. Financially the company does really well
Cox is transitioning themselves to be more then just a internet provider for their customers, we are currently building out our cloud portfolio and we level recent aquisitions to help us build a name in this space. This is an opportunity to put your stamp in building the infrastructure to help our customers of various sizes.
Great company with great benefits
Great company to work for with many benefits.
Amazing culture, career development, everybody genuinely cares about each other. Cox culture is second to none. Hands down great place to work.
Unlimited PTO, great culture, awesome leadership
everything is a pro. A great place
This company has a good retirement progam and benefits.
This was one of the best companies I have ever worked for, hands down. The department I worked in was small and we had high-stress calls but the team leaders, supervisors, and coworkers were great at helping support one another. The pay and benefits were outstanding and their reward system was very motivating.
When I was employed, the commission structure made up for the stress of the job. Monthly commission. Great work environment.
Positive team environment, great training.
-Putting Employees First -Creating a culture that focuses on the well-being of each employee. -Enforcing a culture that holds everyone accountable for fair and honest treatment of employees and customers.
The level of talent at Cox is insane! From my peers to my superiors to those I worked with across the country I had the pleasure of working with some of the most talented people that I've ever encountered. They push you, challenge you and help you every step of the way. The benefits are also incredible, from the unlimited personal time off to the fraction of the cost cable and wifi benefits that are offered. The Cox family truly cares about their employees and I will forever be grateful for all that they've done for my family and I. Compensation packages are incredibly generous, if I'm being honest I was over paid but I'm not complaining. Work/Life balance is awesome as demonstrated through their unlimited vacation policy. Finally, the culture of inclusion and diversity runs deep there.
Fun atmosphere very busy makes day go fast
People, culture and value placed in employees
Company Culture is truly old school, like family. Leadership cares about employee development, wellness and engagement. Competitive Pay and excellent work-life balance. Looks to promote from within first allowing for growth. Embrace mentoring and Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Belonging.
Good benifits and good starting pay.
I have worked here as a contractor and eventually a full time employee. It has been a great place to work with great team of co-workers and senior leadership. Compensation is competitive to market. I have finally found a place where I have a good work life balance.
Unfortunately nothing good on my 8mo period
Had the pleasure of being part of a great team, positive atmosphere, super bosses
Very Flexible, can work from home
Fully remote workplace or you can work a hybrid model
Diversity and inclusion is a big deal at Cox. It’s very positive in that way. Management receives unlimited PTO. Employees receive free services & discounts on equipment to run those services. (Except for Homelife security.)
Many shift options, transparency in the company, ability to move up is always there, great coaching and open lines of communication, great benefits 401k and discounted service,
Working for Cox they provide data, cable and phone Remote
Great work environment. Excellent place to grow.
great pay and flexibility as well
A lot of smart people. Good employee benefits. A company that, overall, really cares about its employees.
There is ample parking available.
This company is wonderful! Cox is truly doing corporate life the right way. I have not found a negative or unfair thing to say about the company. Employees are encouraged to maintain a healthy work / family life balance and provided resources in which to make that come to fruition. We are championed, cheered, acknowldged and supported immensely to succeed yet not micro-managed and made to feel untrustworthy as micro-managing does to a person. Cox recognizes we all need to play a role in giving back to the communities we call home. Cox has a volunteer incentive program in place to help us do that so we all do our part to give back and convey gratitude to those we call neighbors. It is refreshing to see how many women are in executive and management positions. I love that a different point of view or idea is not only encouraged but highly expected of all of us to say regardless of job title or rank.

Fun but really fun like so much fun
Cox Communications, Cox Automotive, Cox Enterprises and the rest of the portfolio are an amazing family of companies run like a family business. The mission, vision, and care with which the leaders of these companies lead is truly a privilege to be a part of.
","I only wish I'd found this company earlier in my career!
None that I have come across so far.
One of the downsides of my previous job was the lack of significant pay increases. Whenever there were raises, they rarely made a noticeable difference to my salary. Another issue was that reporting managers often made tough decisions that negatively affected the mental health of their subordinates. Unfortunately, when we tried to bring these concerns to their attention, they didn't seem to listen. And even when we escalated the situation to higher-ups, there was no effort made to address the problematic behavior.
Siloed capabilities Difficult to explore work in other groups Terrible comp philosophy
Not a ""con"", just an ""aha"".... 401K not available until 90 days employment not day 1 like the rest of the benefits (which are GREAT)!
In the last year, our sales commissions have been reduced by 85%. Also, all calls are monitored by an AI system, which drives the most heavily weighed metric, but they constantly tweek it, and leave it largely up to the employee to figure out on their own what corrections to make.
The company is very big, and may often be viewed as convoluted in terms of their various business practices.
They have been having extreme layoffs so trust in the company is diminishing.
Shift changes often You may get the schedule you do not want
COLA pay adjustment is not usually calculated
Shift changes often You may get the schedule you do not want

Employees are so focused on following direction, there's little to no thinking outside the box. Cause for concern on work/life balance.
MANAGEMENT, Metrics that some high up that never answered phones put together, tell you to be empathetic, but yell and write you up for being over empathetic - example: cx husband died, she needs to reduce the bill, can't figure out wifi password - sell more products, tell her to get a neighbor to help, hang up. - really?!?!
Followers in the industry and slow at making decisions
- Salaries are not the highest in the market
If your not in the cool kids club, you are not advancing. They do not have value for results, only those that can speak like a politician.
I am sure there are some CONS
Pay is Okay but not industry standard if you are already in the company, raises are hard to come by, especially in the Care department.
Very outdated upper management thinks they are gods gift…
It's a call center. The hardest part of the job is the changing specials they have every few weeks or so that you have to push to the customers to make sales.
you had to do a shift bid every year
Employees are so focused on following direction, there's little to no thinking outside the box. Cause for concern on work/life balance.
In some departments, leadership levels get increasingly focused on politics vs. business outcomes and don't reflect the ""nice"" culture that is discussed at this company.

Not sure I have any
Decisions through committee means slow at taking decisions. Many people have long tenures (~20+ years). As a new employee, it take time to build a network so you are a little bit of disadvantage while persuading colleagues to a decision.
If your not in the cool kids club, you are not advancing. They do not have value for results, only those that can speak like a politician.
Having to re-apply and re-interview for the same job about every 4 or 5 years.
At least from my perspective in tech support, the customers can be quite the characters Also working from home made me feel isolated, even though there are regular meetings and team games to help engage with coworkers.
With smaller profits being made, the senior management team started cutting the benefits and Long term incentives for the team below Director level to fund their bonus pool. The company has jumps on social / social justice ""causes"" just to look ""woke"".
Limited upward mobility once you make middle management Limited mobility without a college degree regardless of experience
High-stress, unstable industry, isolating, pressure, unpredictable
Very outdated upper management thinks they are gods gift…
There are no cons at Cox
Short breaks for 8 & 10 hour shifts. Fast paced calls are usually back to back not too much down time
You will experience a lot of call center chatter like high school but its like family so you do good its talked about in a good way and if you do good its talked about in a jealous way. Yet, keep killing it and getting those commission checks.
None. I enjoy working at Cox
I won't bore you with the details, party because I'm inching doing so .. The bottom line, in short... Cox made alot of changes all at once, made things very difficult, and caused a negative atmosphere. In my opinion, Cox should have made some of those changes beneficial to the employee.
Can get busy at times.
Every department has different work from home agreements Traffic around the headquarters (commuting)
If you don’t like to sit in one place all day it may not be the job for yourself
Not within the company but this role specifically, there are a lot of outside uncontrollable factors that go into pay that only happen in this role. This is still sales so you have to anticipate not so ethical practice and even though Lots of changes in commission. Just big business sales stuff, every year it gets harder to make money. Nothing against cox, I've been in sales so I get it.
If you don't want to take calls this is not a role for you. If you hate working from home this is not a role.for.you
company is doing round after round of layoffs and re-orgs. They have bad high-level goal setting, leading to freak outs when they don't hit unrealistic numbers
Scorecards, demanding, and cutthroat. Make sure you have a heart for sales.
Easier to get into the field than it was a few years ago.
workload and time in meetings
The workplace is always changing. Cox is in a constant push to streamline things, so a department might be closed down or your duties might increase without warning.
Burn out, work hours ,back to back calls
No advancement, no career development focus
Training could have been better, changing product line without a lot of prewarning, customers knew about offers before employees.
The Chairman is 3rd generation Cox-family and seems nice enough and smart, but at the end of the day he's a billionaire who was born a billionaire - and he mainly wants us to keep delivering billions. During recent layoffs, it was interesting that out of thousands laid off for having a bad year (vs. plans mind you, we still grew and made huge margins) not a single one of the executives responsible for signing off on the plans/targets or for all the hiring we suddenly needed to right-size were also laid off. Hmmm... makes you really think don't it?
The company is going through changes and communication about those changes could be handled a lot better.
Low pay too high expectations
No remote work although you can do hybrid in one of their locations
Cox Business needs to be one company and have the companies they acquired fit under one umbrella. Customers complain they get different bills for the different services we offer instead of one bill with the breakdown of services
None I can think of.
Micromanagement from New leadership changes
None. Been with the company 6 years now and it feels like I just started yesterday.
Sometimes slow to move things along
There are no con's here.
All supervisors are not created equal some really care about your growth and potential other just let you fail without any guidance,
Their attendance policy is very strict and although they do offer abundant PTO, if you have an emergency that you can't use your PTO for (not enough hours available that day, etc) you are subject to disciplinary measures.
Very stressful job. Constant phone calls. Always busy. Your dealing with angry customers.
Salary, was too low. Could not miss any days in training.
There are none. Truly this is the work lotto that everyone would dream of hitting!
Trying to get resources, IT and financial, to create dashboards and other meaningful tools is a challenge. Atlanta takes all of the resources and kicks any asks from the field out year after year.
I would say there aren't any cons
Increased competition has led to some challenges
No cons for me. Have been with Cox 10 years, Have had three promotions and am making about 75% more than when I started. Hard work and results that help the company are truly rewarded. I hope to spend another 20 years with Cox and retire comfortably.
Training is less and less every year. Changes happen on a whim and can drastically effect your work load. You are not given additional time for additional work. Leadership wants feedback on issue but if you give to much feedback they think you complain to much. Leadership is a major issue and acts like they do not care about employees but says they care about their employees. Currently, they are trying to cross train technicians in positions that would come with an additional pay raise but are not giving additional pay raise to those techs. Career progression in this company is heavily about luck and timing.
Moving up within organization can be a lengthy and time consuming process.
- Development using remote computer, extremely slow - 11h/day routine is very normal. - Lack of management. - 4h meetings everyday - Low salary
schedule was set in stone
Hard to move up, no in line promotions in my department
Hard to advance to manager level
The departments have shift bids based on performance and tenure. Seems fair, but 90% of shifts available to choose from are not family friendly. Bad work life balance. The employee medical benefits are not as good as they were before. Also, Cox no longer has a pension for employees who started after 2017.
Work love balance sucks sometimes because of how they change shifts, annual shift bid based off of performance so if you struggle a couple months you may get a over night shift, technical support also works 24/7 so lots of overnight
None that I can think of
There were no cons. Love the environment.
there is a nonstop grind based on their goals.
Not have a lots of Cons. Company should have focus more on employee development.
I have nothing good to say about this place. The employees gossip and backstab. The managers are unethical and will ask employees to be unethical as well.
You will love your job too much and never want to leave!!!
None that i have seen
Outdated customer is always right mentality Mandatory overtime Some undesirable schedules
None really, enjoy working there.
Must keep up with change
Politics runs high with some managers, directors and up, loyalty is only one way always look out on who you trust, if your apart of the inter circle you got it but if you think differently and stand up for yourself look out #targeted some would call that strike 1 and 2
Employee treatment is very poor
there is a nonstop grind based on their goals.
Not have a lots of Cons. Company should have focus more on employee development.

- Good financial/professional experience - Personal finance knowledge - There is upward mobility*** - Great feeling of helping others
When I 1st started working her my training branch was awesome! I did have to drive 45 minutes to get to work but that's Atlanta. Everyone in the branch were great to customers and employees.
Very good company and clear target in the near future,
This organization knows how to treat its employees. The company Minimum wage last I was there was $19 an our for an entry level position. Management always seemed to care more about helping me succeed and find the next best opportunity for me, rather than try to keep me in the same job day in and day out. It's a great place to work, and a great place to grow!
The program allows you to get a breadth of experience across the bank in different orgs. Big focus on personal development and your own learning. Ability to make friends in leadership who can get you where you want to go. Fantastic work/life balance.
pay is competitive and that is it
High starting salaries for bankers Good communication from HR and leadership Build great relationships with customers They value long term customers a lot Great work life balance, off work everyday by 5:15.

","Difficult to push through improvements due to prioritization and resource constraints
High pressured sales goals. Empty promises about incentive compensation. You make work yourself down to bones and they would still tell you that you're not doing enough. I asked for PTO on several occasions (a year in advance) and it would go unapproved because PTO time around holidays are reserved for employees that have children. Management would claim that we were fully staffed with one full time teller and a part time teller to run a high foot traffic branch, causing the bankers to spend most of their work time being a teller. During a banker meeting hosted by the regional managers, we were told to advertise ourselves and fifth third by going door to door to people's homes outside of work hours to provide individuals with our business cards to ""build our businesses"" (extremely unsafe). Technology is extremely outdated and I spent most of my day waiting for my computer to load so I can attempt to process basic every day transactions. Health insurance has a high deductible. Management frequently asks for feedback but then provides defensive responses to suggestions, making you feel small. Partners within organization are difficult to work with. No overtime is allowed but you are often required to stay late to make outbound sales calls and required to take longer lunches or come in late some days to make sure you don't get any overtime pay.
- There is upward mobility but only when someone quits or a new branch opens up which is, more often than not, delayed for months even years. - Work-life balance is not great - Your work experience is entirely dependent on who your manager is. If you have a manager that is interested in your success as opposed to just the branch's success, it is great. - They will tell you to focus on pushing one product each month and if you don't hit a certain metric, your branch is considered ""unsuccessful"" even if you sell in other areas.
The company hires uncquilified personnel for their branch managers. A week after I got to my permenant branch location in the heart of Atlanta we got a new branch manager whom had never worked for a bank before and had no degree. This was a lateral move for me I came from the corporate side to retail. I have a degree in finance, had managed a number of people before and they told me I needed retail experience to get the management position. Each branch manager gets a 90 day ""grace"" period before they have to hit their numbers. This manager did nothing and said they would just get another job in 90 days. That's exactly what happened for that manager and the next. Whom also had no banking or finance experience and no degree. These managers dierespected the employees and customers. There were numerous calls to HR from my co-workers and HR never did anything about it. The company doesn't care about HR issues as long as they are making the money they want.
Not found yet. and will discover soon.
The company as a whole is great. However, depending on the position, the software always felt slow and outdated. They did a massive HR site overhaul right before I left which made it slightly better, but there is still lots of room for improvement.
Lots and lots of hoops to jump through sometimes. You’re largely left isolated in terms of where you rotate through, what skills you want to learn etc so you have ti actually out in that effort. Some don’t and have bad experiences. Pay both in the program and coming out is less than the standard. If you’re great, you can fight for more but good luck. No real benefits to program outside of above, not that it’s a bad thing.
Sales environment. Working late on Fridays. Outbound and inbound calling. phones are always ringing. Call centers and employee support are outsourced to other countries. HUGE NO NO!
Promotions are 5-10 years away for most job positions, and even then you are battling it out with 50+ other extremely qualified inside potential hires. No commission structure what so ever and the bonus's based on your numbers are absolutely awful. They use that to try and get employees to work harder, however if you work extremely hard, you can expect to earn an extra $250 a year vs if you put in no effort. The bonuses also track your ""primacy and retention"" however they add customers to your numbers that open their accounts online and when you can't reach them and they overdraw their account and close it, it hurts your chance at the bonus.
receiving more help from the management would help out a lot.
If you are here for long it is hard to receive raises that are deserved when they increase minimum wage
Inadequate staffing for high expectations. Lack of hands on training for new hires. Expectations of increased work load before and after PTO.
Better resources Needs better options to balance my work life and home lomifr balance.
I had a negative experience... mostly to do with COVID. I was trained at a branch where most people were new to their position and a Manager that had been there too long when he would teach it was like ""it's easy.""
Work/life balance was just extremely difficult Bad management Stressful because they force sales
Low IT, no travel, many departments
There is nothing I can think of that is a negative.
Yearly bonus could be more, based on performance throughout the year.
Pay is below average for long employees, new hires get better pays , makes experienced employees feel unappreciated
Depending on where you work. Can be a very negative environment. The work can become repetitive and sales goals can seem out of reach.
pay is usually at or below par, raises dont exist outside of end of year review
Fast pace, must be super flexible,
Not necessarily a con- but overall banking can be a difficult business if you are looking to make big leaps and bounds on projects.

Advancement opportunities are not plentiful
Couldn't lateral to different divisions of the bank internally so ended up leaving
Out of date offices Headquarters
Having to take an unpaid lunch break every day.
They focus to much on being in new as opposed to keeping top talent. Sad to see great purple moving to other banks to increase pay.
Good portion of overall comp is bank-performance-based rather than individual performance base with potential of year-end comp being negatively impacted by something outside of your control.
Customers can be rude but that's everywhere
I have no bad things to say
Working remotely is not as flexible as it might seem.

Remote work select positions only
If you don’t like change it may not be your cup of tea because things changed often in my experience so the company could evolve.
Nothing to note on dons
old school infastructure could use update
Work load, stress level, extreme expectations for sales, cold calling
The location I chose to work at
Communication across the levels could be better
Not much cons for 5/3
Less pay Emphasize on in-person attendance Expects to participate in extra curriculars
Still stuck in old ways
The raises are trash. They do not promote often.
Could use better technology for employee systems. The ""Darkside"" system is outdated and can be intimidating to navigate.
Stressful, and pay was very lacking.
The company could do better with maternity leave.
If you don’t like change it may not be your cup of tea because things changed often in my experience so the company could evolve.
Local branches are grossly short-staffed, almost at dangerous levels where only 2-3 employees may only be present at certain times of day. Often little to no time can be spent on customers as more time is needed to assist a single Lead Teller at the branch. And we were frequently pushed to promote credit cards and services to clients who did not need them.
Not a lot of room for promotion and growth within the company. Big teams make it difficult to interact with senior management. Oftentimes, feels like you're just another employee.
Nothing to note on dons
The assistant was power hungry and highly critical. Favorites were picked and your work was targeted if you were not on that list.
The culture is tough on those not native to Cincinnati.

Management is gaint unwashed terrible

Outbound sales calls, each banker is expected to make at least 15 outbound sales calls a day. This is in addition to having to manage time between teller line and at your desk helping customers with more complex issues (or sales). This is essentially two different jobs rolled into one so it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Management can be very secretive with changes and not let employees know about being moved to new locations until a few days before they start. Hard to move out of retail sales into other departments.
The company could do better with maternity leave.
None that come to mind, it's been a great place to work
Limited room for growth unless you know upper management well.
If you are just looking for a job, it can be difficult to find the doors. This made it difficult because I was content in my role but I may have not had leaders that wanted me to thrive more while I was there.
Nothing really overworked Bad schedule Stiff and Old fashioned
Different departments sometimes have drama. There’s a lot of women in my department especially so there’s always someone in someone else’s business . If you just come to get your job done and go home you’ll be ok. I feel like the company could budge to pay even more for the work we do and give us bonuses but they’re stingy with alot of things . We always have to do compliance testing and it’s annoying . Pros out way the cons for SURE

Limited retail staff. no accountability for poor performance. Awful insurance options!
No down side, good place to work
Management is gaint unwashed terrible
High employee turnover and workload
Understaffing, poor support, processes in trust seem to take excessively long, do not support your licenses. Management/Leadership seems to lack vision.
Compensation raise is very minimal unless you are in leadership position.
Working to 6pm on Fridays
Sometimes can be slow due to how portfolios pay out, then you’re slammed the next week
Poor management, high-school gang, after training you should face all retail challenges independently without any appreciation for your hard work, be ready to do more than your responsibilities, Racist and Resism if you are not white you'll face favorite games, Managers Unprofessional communication with employees, There's no bonus they making you work hard making millions for nothing at the end, They hire people with no financial experience or Zero background, Exceptions for relatives or friends to get a high support from management to get promoted over the educated and hard workers, Do Not waist your time and effort in Fifth Third bank. Not recommended.
Only cares about sales, did not care about employees

Work-life balance can be a struggle at times.
opportunities, leadership, location, technology, business model
Nothing much it is a bank job
When I worked there they were a bit behind within technology and trying to catch up with some competitors Benefits could be a little better Salary and raises don't support current inflation rates
No cons honestly they were great

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Groupon-Reviews-E301291.htm,"Management looks out for your best interests including career advancement. Employees help one another succeed despite role or tenure. Excellent work-life balance. You will be recognized for your hard work. I've been able to experience vertical career growth across and roles and departments during my time here.
Benefits and culture are fantastic. Probably the best training you can get as well. Lots of growth opportunities as well. Fun place overall.
Groupon was a great place to start my career. All companies will brag about there culture but Groupon was truly the best that I have ever seen. Some of the friends that I made were lifelong friends
Had a lot of pros earlier but not now. The only pro it has now is.... Well lemme think.. oh wait it's NOTHING.
- people - cross-functional experiences - always learning something new as new tools and products change/develop - work/life balance, remote work
Any and all pros for working at the company have been completely stripped away.
Decent benefits and a relatively nice office. Middle management was mostly hands off and allowed employees to function as they wanted.
People were great to work with, nice company culture
-Culture: made some great connections otherwise none
Flexible work hours depending on your manager.
- Ample opportunity to close small/medium/large businesses in many of our top marketplaces. - Commissions can be high if you're a top producer. - Flexible with time off for vacations or trips if you're hitting OTE
Great managers and team. friendly culture
People are cool - jobs are relatively straightforward. When put on the right team & have the right manager, it is a great place to work with excellent benefits.
Flexible schedule, worked on a team that shared ideas, and I built a trusted rapport with all lines of business. I'm forever grateful for learning all the technical tools! I had a lot of from the old Groupon, that the new employees I hope you will experience. ERG activities, Summer Party (outdoors), Holiday Party and happy hour.
individuals are nice and sometimes competent
Unlimited paid time off is great
Great place to work and learn
Great Money. Great People. Encouraging Management
3 years ago i would have given Groupon 5 stars. It used to be an amazing company. Covid and the decision that resulted killed Groupon. There were so many of us trying to keep the culture and fun throughout the pandemic, but unfortunately decisions made by those in the captain's chair changed everything.
Come for the unlimited PTO, stay for the great people, had some of the best mid and senior level managers ever... Until they were either laid-off or left the company, it had great benefits compared to other places and the culture was great, lots of flexibility and very humane all the way to the Directors (from the VP level up its the absolute opposite) I have great memories from working here and when it was good, it was one of the best companies I've ever worked
learned sales skills, worked with fun people your own age
Good benefits, nice culture, thorough training
Work culture and WLB is positive.
Get to learn a lot quickly
There is a flexibility and support system
People and culture are great
- The team - specifically in Getaways - truly acted as a team with the mindset that we all were working towards the same goal. - Opportunity to take on more responsibility outside of daily role which brought an abundance of skill development and network growth. - 401k, insurance, and unlimited PTO. Since working at Groupon I went to another company with unlimited PTO and in comparison, Groupon made it possible for me to take a week off every quarter. Granted I worked hard for that but to be able to have as much vacation time as a European citizen really made it all worth it. But I guess that might depend on the team you were on, and given I worked in the getaways sector, vacation was obviously important to us all.
going through lots of changes now
- good wlb - competitive pay - friendly team - 100% remote I got laid off around when PFC started taking over and cutting costs. Dusan strikes me as a leader with a vision to save his company's investment in Groupon, no matter what cost to employees or the culture.
Great people, good culture, decent insurance
Remote work is the only Pro
The people are great, lots of opportunities for growth.
I liked some aspects of working here. The salary was not one. The growth and development was great though.
Potential exists to make good money
people are great in office perks
Super flexible- completely remote (in the US at least), people are helpful and understanding. Unlimited PTO is actually real here once you're hitting targets- Benefits are decent(401K & HSA matches, work from home stipend initially). Good work-life balance (In Sales at least) They have been pretty transparent with communications. ""Diverse"" compared to most tech companies out there (not in upper level management though). The product can be useful to small businesses. The people here are great.
The people that work there are okay but the overall culture is lacking
Horrible not worth it or my time
There are not many positives besides *some* commiserating coworkers, and they can be flexible at times.
My team was amazing. WLB was respected.
Can’t really think of any - company used to have great culture, talent and benefits. Business performance has forced them to take drastic cost-cutting measures.
Its a great place to gain global business experience.
Great coworkers (leadership aside) and remote work
Work Life Balance is Good
good pay and great team of professionals
Working in a satellite office, you had the autonomy of supporting the offices and always kept busy
Lots of opportunity to increase your commission, lots of businesses to work with, easy job.
Not much, I guess the unlimited PTO is nice.
Remote, generous pto, direct deposit.
Groupon has good company culture and the people are truly what make it great. If you land a good manager, you can be very happy at Groupon.

fun team culture type outings
Unlimited time off, remote, management is good

Groupon was a great place for me to learn and grow as a sales professional. I am so grateful for the opportunities Groupon provided me and mentorships I received from countless talented leaders over the years.
Great Culture, Great Building, Great Training Program.
The people who work here are great. Like a community.
12 companies in one - lots to learn Friendly coworkers
Decent commission plan and great benefits
Groupon employees are wonderful. Everyone I've worked with is intelligent.
Great work environment Orientation was fun and interactive
Short-term employment as company is failing
The people, good mix of startup and big/public company culture
- Work with a lot of good people -Have the ability to make good money - Managers do not Micro Manage - Easy sales process when you learn your vertical
Good people to work with.
Flat organization, easy access to leadership
The people are great. So many people have dedicated a large portion of their careers and are invested in the growth and development of the people around them.
A constant sense of danger of being laid off
Good if you've never had another job before
Work load was pretty light
","There can be sizable changes made that affect multiple departments. Be prepared to reprioritize based on the current needs of the business.
Slight uncertainty at times, but that has been quite typical of this entire industry in the last year.
The salary was so low compared to industry standards The company lost all of its identity went it went remote All top talent has left years ago There is just no direction that the company is going
What used to be pros of the company are now cons of it. Right from the moment venture capitalists stepped in; the company is going to dogs. It's disheartening to see the current state of groupon. Earlier the company used to be a haven for the employees but now it's more like a one way trip to hell. The management fires employees without a prior intimation or notice. It's feels as if they wake up in the morning and think as to whom or which team should I fire. Doesn't matter if u are the best performer or the best performing team; you will be fired. This is not an exaggeration. People are being fired like a sport. Dusan and his team must learn proper people management. For them cost optimization is firing employees. A personal suggestion from my side to people looking to join Groupon. Please DON'T. Management now is least interested in your growth, your performance or your existence for that matter. What used to be a great company is now in the rabbit's hole. Look for some other better companies. All that these people care is money and I am not even talking about profit that you generate. Despite you being the top performer you will be be fired. And yes don't even expect an explanation from their side coz they won't. Strongly will never recommend this hell of a place to anyone. The mental and physical stress that they throw on you is not worth it.
- frequent layoffs in the last 5 years, and especially the last year, have led to much fewer employees doing the work of everyone that was let go or quit, resulting in constant scrambling to find who does what - company touts a ""performance culture"", but laid off numerous tenured, high performers which loses credibility of senior leadership - most promotions and leadership are now in INTL, losing hope for US employees - tools and products do not evolve with changing tech landscape
Private equity firm has come in to ""turn the business around"" and all they're doing is spewing empty promises. Because of layoffs, current employees are taking on the role of 4 people. Any existence of positive company culture or emphasis on DEI has been completely eliminated. Extremely long hours, leaves taken away, no retentions bonuses, no performance bonuses. They're setting the North America business up to be completely dissolved by end of year.
Too many responsibilities for one role. Customer service responsibilities often swallowed up any potential time to sell, especially for a sales focused role that depends on exceeding quota metrics for promotion.
Many US employees were laid off
Unattainable goals: sets unrealistic goals for its employees, leading to high levels of stress and burnout among staff members. Frequent changes in commission and goals: has a reputation for changing commission rates and sales goals frequently, often with little notice or explanation. It creates a sense of instability and uncertainty among employees. Poor working conditions: There have been reports of poor working conditions at Groupon, no support from upper management Lack of transparency: lack of transparency in its business practices, including its commission structure The base pay is a joke and not livable especially for a place like Chicago
Leadership doesn't have clear direction.
- Constant management and commission changes every quarter.
base salary, constantly changing comp plans. new investment company
Everything is all over the place. The turnover is constant and it seems like there are constant changes happening. At times job duties are overloaded while at other times, they are lax.
Lack of today's design and technological (AI) tools for implementation to processes for all lines of businesses. The private equity firm to runs Groupon did not get a chance to know the Groupon employees, the culture, and what the company meant to the employees. The wall was always up and that is how I knew my time was finished at Groupon. It was fun while it lasted, however, all things must come to an end. I wish Groupon all the best in all their future endeavors
senior leadership / board of directors. no strategy, no empathy, no nuffin'
Needs a bit more direction when it comes to long term goals
Not performing well due to recession.
Changes too frequently. Bad reputation with merchants.
Kedar.....enough said. The end of Groupon as we knew it. Although he's no longer the CEO the damage by the board's decision to appoint him is done. Groupon is no longer the incredible culture and environment we all knew and loved. Don't do it. Groupon is dead. Culture is dead. Office life is dead. We're all gone. Everyone who was not laid off was smart enough to jump ship. Just say No.
In retrospective it's pretty sad, coming from the upbeat and very human way in which Aaron and John ran the company through the pandemic, to the collapse of everything that was good that happened afterwards, honestly should've seen it coming judging from the way Aaron was replaced even though he managed to keep the company and the morale of the workers from sinking through COVID. The new management is absolutely deaf, Pulse surveys thinned out and then disappeared specially when Layoffs happened and chaos became the norm, at times it felt like the CTO wanted to thin the headcount by destroying every process we had, and making every work day a miserable experience. Most of the great people I knew that worked there were laid off or gone, lots of rumors that the goal is and always was to offshore all the technology team which is at odds with the supposed ""local destination"" message they wanted to convey. Whatever this company was 5 or even 2 years ago, it clearly isn't anymore. Pretty sad outlook overall. Compensation was average to below average
not a good work environment, people got fired every other day, little room for career growth and difficult to make money in sales
High metrics, pay a bit low
Lack of vision at leadership level.
The company is mostly run by Czech investors. * Company is mostly hiring contractors. * Existing Groupon employees are seen as idiots. * Mostly only hiring Czech employees. * Constant wave of promotion freezes. * Promotion freezes are gone for now and only Czech employees get promoted and especially to senior positions. * A good number of filled positions are friends of the Czech leaders and in some cases have no experience in the role. * Existing employees are over worked since 70% of engineering let go. * Unrealistic deadlines assigned without any consideration for work required or existing workload. * Constant org restructures * Constant change in priorities * Do not apply for Groupon. There is no career path or job security.
Ultimately dragged down by concept and enactment
Shifting workforce away from US based teams in favor of international
- Salary, this is where you build your resume and skills to get better pay. - Upward mobility - Politics
No bonus no merit increase
- i got laid off - leadership can't decide what to do - company is failing - low employee morale
Not enough pay, upper management doesn't know what they are doing
Leadership has been doing everything they can to not pay their reps since Q4 of 2022. Monthly goal changes Toxic internal competition Leadership cannot and will not explain how our commission rates have been paid out since 2022. If asked, they dance around the question. HR is unhelpful. Going to them about issues results in 0 accountability and you will end up getting ignored by them. Looks at its employees as numbers. They’ve made it very clear that we all have to suffer while the company suffers. Unrealistic goals and work loads in attempt to push people out so they don’t have to pay severance.
Company performance is bad, so focus is only one: cost control.
They pay could have been better.
hard to get established enough to get there.
changes everyday after covid turned into a call center perks and parties are gone and the job is just people screaming at you about coupons.
Not the company they used to be 5-10 years ago- most business owners associate it with cheapness and low margins. Pay could be better- its not very hard to hit targets but commissions haven't picked up post covid. As a result they have been doing a lot of experimenting with the product to bring back revenues. They've been automating a lot as well and scaling back on cost- hopefully they don't reduce headcount which they've been hinting at for the last six months (again they are transparent about all this which I appreciate). As a result of all the changes and innovations some things get swept under rug because Account management is bogged down. New CEO is good and not afraid to talk to us often but a lot of times he uses language that doesn't really answer questions (high level rhetorical answers that don't address our concerns) Also there is no upward mobility for now they froze promotions indefinitely.
Winners set up to win more losers to lose fast
Horrible place to spend time
Groupon is NOT DEI friendly. I have various email exchanges with Senior Partners and even HR and the way they act toward certain people (or NOT act; ignore)). In 2023, it is very shocking to see such lack of DEI - although they advertise it all over their company profile page, I, and many others, know this company is far from diverse, or inclusive. Another con is the long-term viability of this company on just its actual product/service alone. I know very few people who use Groupon anymore. Times have changed. Groupon should've been sold to Google years ago for billions, but it can barely make the millions now. Even fudging the numbers like they did in the past (google it) can't save this company. The lack of DEI seals the deal. *for media inquiries, I have 100% real proof of this and backups as well. All emails can be confirmed.
The company never bounced back after COVID, and as a result of this the company has gone through several mass layoffs in the past year (and hiring contractors overseas). The manner in which positions were cut make very little sense to me. The manner in which employees were laid- off in January 2023 was not compassionate in the slightest - including terminating all health insurance policies within 1 week of termination and offering a very lacking severance package. Recent hires have never been spared from layoffs. New upper management would routinely disrupt the established engineering workflow with last minute and urgent asks. This quickly became the norm.
Massive headcount reductions, and lost a lot of institutional knowledge.
Poor work life balance, demanding senior management with conflicting goals.
-Low pay -Horrible, disorganized leadership (One example: CEO Kedar Deshpande sent out a company-wide email on NYE to let us know that no one would be getting an annual bonus. The timing and content of this email was one of the most bizarre communications I’ve ever received from a leader. This is just one of many examples of awful leadership I’ve encountered at Groupon.) -The company is now being run by a PE firm out of Eastern Europe, and their only goal is to strip all the value out of the company before they sell out
Poor management, lack of direction, poor morale
unexpected mass layoffs and little support after
Being a satellite office, less opportunities for growth
Changes comp plan a lot, new ceo a lot, with the economy changing so much there are a lot of ups and downs
Pay is a joke. Morale is low. Senior Leadership is floundering.
You are overworked, poorly compensated not heard regardless of the company survey. Mass layoffs impacted our already hindered relationships with our merchants.
Groupon has never managed to nail its winning strategy and as a result, you have to be incredibly change resilient, vacillating wildly between projects and initiatives. The pace is great to build experience but can be wildly exhausting and make the work feel like its for nothing.
Hard to find free parking,

CEO’s lack of accountability, vision, direction
Company seemed kind of directionless when I was there. It was also a revolving door for the head of our department.
Sales process felt wrong. For training you have to convince (non-savvy) business owners to sell their product/service for a fraction of the price, while Groupon takes half of the profit.
Company Closed. Most of the Great Talent left.
With all recent changes culture is degrading very rapidly from collegial, help one-another to a timesheets tracking at all levels, corner cutting, no human capital appreciating change without end.
Been through 4 layoffs in 3 years. The company isn't doing well and if you're after job security this is not the place to be.
There can be sizable changes made that affect multiple departments. Be prepared to reprioritize based on the current needs of the business.
Horrible management Horrible training Product is okay, worked in BW and take a lot from biz owners
Company isn’t doing well. Pay isn’t competitive.
super tough sell and a lot of uphill battle
Too many layoffs and not enough people use it anymore
Bad Upper Management Bad stock Prices
CEO was absolutely incompetent Despite the recent layoff, new leadership seemed much more qualified Company has been declining and unprofitable for years
Lots of change due to cost cutting
Suspension of bonus, merit increase and promotions
-Not a lot of guidance and clear goals -Not a lot of career growth opportunities -Layoffs, cost cutting etc
Poor leadership at the upper levels
Constant changes in comp plan are a horrible practice. Changes in strategy with no advance warning. Everyone is demoralized by these changes.
Leadership has changed the culture a lot lately making it more of a dictatorship than actually allowing SMEs to run their areas
Leadership transparency, cold calling all day, micromanaged
Declining performance accelerated by the pandemic, impacting career growth, compensation, job security (layoffs) Top level leadership
Change happens to often to sometime see growth within the company.
Hard to find free parking,
- Too much uncertainty. It's just sad to see the current state of the company. - Idk how they're making decisions to laying off talented people with so much institution knowledge - so much miscommunication and disconnect with senior leadership - used to be pretty open culture with prior CEO (Aaron Cooper) and CTO (John Higginson), but sadly it's not the same in my opinion - Morale in the company is at the lowest in my opinion
Pay below average for work
From top to down i've experienced poor leadership at all levels, from CEO to senior creatives.
senior leadership intentionally doesnt pay what you deserve/earn
Burn out, pay is low
Company seemed kind of directionless when I was there. It was also a revolving door for the head of our department.
The tools needed for sales to successfully execute were constantly breaking in 2022 more than ever before. This made it difficult to carry out responsibilities, and the support for these tools was much less of a priority than it had been in previous years.
Company Closed. Most of the Great Talent left.
Everything else. Not worth working here.
No amount of rearranging the deck chairs have made a dent in business model flaws
Make it very hard to get commission
Chaotic workplace with complex systems and confusing leadership
Lots of lay offs and HR is not considerate
Short-term employment as company won't be open long.
The company has gone downhill fast with the new CEO, several rounds of layoffs, unclear direction, lack of faith in leadership, new ""leadership"" from investors in Czech Republic have taken over
- Consumer base is shrinking year over year - They constantly make changes to your comp plan - Gp goals are hard to hit due to the declining subscribers - Leads are not new or good usually
The new interim-CTO is a disaster, has no experience leading full tech orgs, and is instituting dictator-style leadership that is detrimental to the organization. There is no experience from an operational or security perspective and it shows.
Broken business model and hence no growth. Company has not had a successful innovation that moved the needle for the business since its initial product and subsequent launch of Groupon Goods.
Being in sales, you get used to being fluid. In this organization, sales is lifeblood and the decision to recently layoff 40% of the sales team is absurd. This company is ~14 years old and people who had been there for 5, 8, 10, even 12+ years were laid off. Given our business model, there are going to be a ton of clients with a lot of questions and I don't think that was taken into account.
Any useful tools that cost money will be decommissioned
It has changed a lot and is not the same place it once was
management makes rash changes without considering results

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Experian-Reviews-E42406.htm,"Inclusive company with a great culture.
Experian fosters a culture of innovation and collaboration to solve difficult issues for clients and consumers. I take pride knowing our solutions make a difference and create a better tomorrow. The company has committed to flexible work with no missed opportunities to connect with others.
The things that drew me to Experian almost 3 years ago hold true and keep me very happy here today. Commitment to a sustainable work/life balance, diversity and inclusion efforts, and the overall culture. Contrary to that of my previous employer, I feel trust and support from my team and my supervisor instead of micromanagement. I've also felt encouraged and supported, rather than held back, in exploring different career paths within the Company.
Very supportive and brilliant senior leadership that is smart, tries hard to listen to employees. People take care of each other making it a very fun environment to work. Management also tries to provide opportunities across the globe for anyone that raises the hand.
Emphasis on people! Fun! (even for remote workers) Great pay and benefits Strong company culture and employee resource groups!
Experian has an excellent culture with talented professionals committed to accomplishing our organizational mission. I love the focus on people and development, and when a lot of companies are requiring employees to return to the office Experian remains remote and hybrid.
Huge company that tries to keep a small company feel. Excellent benefits. Excellent pay. Loads of growth opportunities

Experian is a company that has a people first approach that encourages everyone to bring one's whole self to work which make us #uniquelyexperian. Experian offers ERGs, career development programs, and opportunities to serve our community! Experian products also do a world of good to help improve people financial health and protect against fraud, which makes me feel proud to be working for such a great company.
Commitment to not only making the business better but supporting each employee to grow and make their life better. Love that we have a woman CEO (Jennifer Schultz) and a newly appointed woman CHRO, Hiq Lee!

It was fine to work at Experian
Happy time’s working at Experian
People are so nice and helpful. I've rarely talked to someone who wasn't fully willing to help. WLB is great. As long as work is delivered on time, there is no pressure.
- Good company, good mission, great people - Fantastic sustainability and DEI initiatives imbedded into culture
Great Employer. Believes in the work/life balance.
Good Benefits from the start
Friendly environment, caring managers, pleasant work environment
It’s remote, that about it.
work from home opportunities are amazing
I did not think I was going to work in a company where you as employee has a voice and your opinion matters. There is a great work environment and if you are a hard work person you will be fine and rewarded for it.
I’ve worked at Experian for almost a year and have only positive things to say!
Company treats really well the employees, you are able to have great managers that always give feedback and comments about how you can improve.
Good pay and perks. Also good culture.
Interesting work. Lot of flexibility.
","Can be complex internally sometimes
Information can be hard to find with our various communications channels. The information is out there, but you need to find it.
Honestly nothing comes to mind. I love working for Experian.
At times there is lack of alignment between leaders that trickles down and makes cross BU collaboration difficult
People work very hard, so I'd like to have more PTO
Travel limitations make it challenging for in-person connections for remote employees who are not located close to an office.
HUGE company that can get lost along the way. Sometimes slow to move because they are so big.
poor management in certain divisions
More recently, the company culture has changed for the worse. People are no longer respected. Some managers are very rude and disrespectful in meetings and this seems to now be the status quo.
Lower salary compared to the market
Low salary rates Workload over load for employees due to staff shortage. Limited promotion rate Overtime not paid Strict deadlines
As expected with a big organization, sometimes it's hard to figure out who to contact for certain things but someone is always able to point you in the right direction.
I've worked here a number of years and you can't move up or around without knowing someone.
No cons at the moment
Nothing that I can think of.
Micromanagement Micromanagement Micromanagement Bad hours Fake inclusivity
I do not have anything to list as a con.
Nothing I can think of
Can't think of any :)
contract only, all contractors let go for cheaper labor with very little notice. This is at the hands of the engineering lead and not the fault of other managers. I tried for 2 years to get full time and they just don't have room for it.

I've worked here a number of years and you can't move up or around without knowing someone.
Leadership not too in-sync with developers
huge company structured with lots of silos makes it hard to get things done - especially cross-functional teams
Weak raises (3%, no matter what)
Company isn't the way it used to be.
No cons at the moment
Some management personnel disconnection on teams
your job is just waiting to be outsourced. cost cutting measures mean you can't innovate. lots of politics and favoritism. no job growth in marketing division. questionable ethics in how they are using peoples information.
Nothing that I can think of.
Weak raises (3%, no matter what)
Really no downsides to mention especially after adopting a flexible, WFH enviornment.
There are a lot of road blocks that can prevent a job being done effectively and efficiently.
Company isn't the way it used to be.
Large company and a lot of moving parts
Some management personnel disconnection on teams
your job is just waiting to be outsourced. cost cutting measures mean you can't innovate. lots of politics and favoritism. no job growth in marketing division. questionable ethics in how they are using peoples information.
Lots of firefighting and some folks that don't want to evolve to improved ways of working.
Can be very political at times
Lack of consistency from leadership
Large org challenges, and pressure.
Not the most competitive pay. Not super innovative and the products are admittedly boring.
I haven't found any yet.
Really poor leadership....long tired (been here forever leaders) run the show...if you aren't in the clique- you will not get promoted- ever
Nothing comes to mind right now
Lack of room for growth at the lower level Lack of proper resources for certain roles Lack of support with particular partners Stressful metrics No real incentive to go above and beyond.
Remote- weird culture and hard to know people
Large global organization, challenging navigating all business units at times.
complaining callers and the lack of understanding of credit bureaus.
salary ranges across the board could be more competitive
The manager was a little bit too strict.
Need better pay and benefits
It sometimes gets very stressful, especially during reorganization.
I do not really have cons to share
Conversations from the top rarely make it down to the bottom.
Management and leadership are not in touch with the day-to-day needs of the organization and there is a lack of transparency and trust. There is an underlying sense of fear that leads employees to keep their heads down and deal with the political landscape..
None, good employer. Good strategy
work life balance is bad
- Yearly pay raise is lesser than the ongoing market - The learning curve could be better
Nothing that I can think of at this time
- I have not gotten as much swag as I would like
Large corporation - you feel like a number disorganized too many managers that micromanage sales-y type of org
Legacy organization with lots of employees with multiple decades of tenure, can make promotional opportunities challenging
Nothing that comes close to very negative
Can get a little hectic
no upword mobility if not there
really is a cons. just a fact need to adopt - fast pace on the deliverable
None at all at the moment
They were going through growing pains.
Slow career progression with limited upward mobility
- I have not gotten as much swag as I would like
Pretty Old School and hard to move up because of the older sales people who have been there forever.

really is a cons. just a fact need to adopt - fast pace on the deliverable
None at all at the moment
They were going through growing pains.
SaaS products are constant maintenance and due to the fast pace the technical debt left behind increases the need to constant maintenance.
No perks benefits okay need to rto
Offices exist and RTO can happen
Layoffs, no real loyalty to tenured employees.
- More bureaucratic than use to be
The pay structure is very disappointing
The pay is way below market
Sometimes there is a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, but that comes with any job.
There were no glaring cons
Very big company so get a bit lost
Pay could be better. Systems are old. Need to migrate to newer tech.
- Internal competition across sr management viewed as good from the top but creates unnecessary competition and resource mismanagement for everyone else. - Business Unit Management is always distracted by new and shiny ""innovation"" rather than delivering on customer expectations for current agreements.
Large company. If you like new/exciting work, you may be disappointed.
Hard to move up on the ranks
Limited growth opportunities, lack of training
Workload, poor management, high levels of stress.
pay grade is low for employees
I dont see cons so far. Of course as always there are some people that dont do their jobs as expected but nothing you cant handle by yourself
Nothing I can think of
sometimes some decision can take a long time. But this is expected from a big company.
Too enterprisey. Too many levels
Poor Management. Cutting costs at every corner

Meeting some fun and humorous children. Seeing that I made a difference in children's perceptions about themselves.
Boss is flexible and open, mostly hires high school students so great job if you're looking for that. Fairly easy job, mostly consists of grading, filing, and teaching kids basic English and math. Good job for tutoring. Great for part-time because the Kumon only runs for 3 days a week and a couple hours a day, so it doesn't interfere with a lot of things.

","Sometimes parents would overstep and get too involved
Low pay, low hours, mentally draining
Staff turnaround was constant because nearly everyone would get fed up of the indescribably extreme and utterly undeserved verbal harassment, insults, and screaming fits from the franchisee, Mrs. Hsieh that they would eventually just walk out on the spot. She is her own boss, so there was zero oversight. Pay was lower than what I'd thought minimum wage was at the time. It's an extremely difficult job due to the rambunctious unfocused children, but even when staff would pull of miracle after miracle, Mrs. Hsieh invariably found something to viciously criticize before insulting their intelligence.
Only open three days a week
Short working time since most centers are only open for a few hours. Also, disadvantageous for someone who wants to work early in the mornings.
work with 4 primary children at the same time and it can be stressful when they are all reading out loud to you at the same time
work can get tedious at times
not much actual work experience unless you want to be a teacher
Wages are not the greatest
Low pay rate Sometimes very slow
- low pay rate - limited hours
The students can get very distracted
The working days and time was very little
Some students were pretty difficult

Pay is low for work expected
- Students' handwriting can be difficult to read which can cause confusion in logging information - Stressful at times with waves of students checking in with few instructors
No real cons server as great first job
Compensation was poor and so was pay scale
Short hours. Low pay. Not much room for growth
Low pay and boring work
Work can be a bit tedious at times.
Sometimes they were a lot of students that I had to take care of
not much actual work experience unless you want to be a teacher
Fixed hours are the same every week
Dealing with kids. If you don’t have patience for kids don’t join
At certain times, you're expected to cover many different aspects of the job at once which can occasionally get slightly stressful, but it is doable and isn't an issue for most of the time you work there.
Wages are not the greatest
Lower pay, many children at once being taught
- It is only open part-time, twice per week, so it's very part-time work (about 9 hours per week). - Must mainly stick to Kumon method of teaching/guidance.

x x x x x
Very quiet and manager wasn’t really paying attention
The only cons might be some of the kids but its not always like that.
really hectic and wasn't my vibe
none its pretty good overall
You are basically a private tutor, and making 1/6 of what you would make as a private tutor. The kids deserve one on one time and usually can’t get that.
Very bad manager, poor environment, no individual attention
I didn't have any cons
mean lead coordinator and annoying kids
not really an outstanding downsides
The owners of my franchise did not pay me. I had to chase down my well-earned salary two times in one month. The reading part of the Kumon method is not for the demographic and educational situation that we have in central Florida. Nonetheless, owners were unwilling to adapt the method to the needs of the students. Their only interest was charging the parents money, and having the kids repeat as many times as possible out of greed. Not interested in education or helping children - only interested in profit.
Very minimal pay, little negotiating due to age. Sometimes kids cry and also don't do their homework which can be frustrating. Very rigid system, so not great if you're not into rote memorization etc. No benefits but also again most employees are under 18 so not a lot of need. No opportunity for advancement really unless you want to start your own Kumon (there are also only really 2 positions: grader/assistant and the person that owns the Kumon)
Dealing with kids who did not want to be there
A bit mind numbing due to the repetitiveness, but is rewarding when you help kids learn new concepts
n/a, can be overwhelming at times
there are really no cons for this job
There aren’t many cons noted
Low pay on that too on 1099
Pay isn’t great for part time
stressful sometimes lots of kids
The boss is constantly micromanaging, the pay is very small and there are a maximum of 8 hours a week you can work in addition to them being horribly unflexible. Virtually everyone has quit.
Sometimes the hours can be painful, and parent interactions can be rough.
They don't allow teach the students. Let students do it same questions again and again.
Can get disorganized quickly with papers and scheduling
Can get boring at times, since it depends greatly on how many students the center have.
Low pay, need to enjoy working with children.
You cannot be sensitive here.
Not as long of hours compared to other jobs
low pay for a starter job
There were no cons at this job
none- I really enjoyed my time there!
The pay is bordering minimum wage and you don’t get raises often.
Nothing bad to report, exactly what I needed for a short term job
bad pay and they do not value tutors
Minimum wage for a tutor
The work is mostly tedious and repetitive grading.
hours are in the evening and can be spotty
Not enough hours, bad parking spots
low salary, lots of work
Not very flexible hours and hard to find a cover for your shift.
Pay could be more, no overtime work
None there not any cons
I didn’t feel super secure in the job
Given less hours to work for 3 days a week.
- It can get very boring
Limited hours as they are only open for few hours a day
attentive focused limited work time
Not too bad, just have to know how to multitask, for sure
Monotonous and can get boring Not suitable for those who do not like sitting at a desk all day
This is one of those few jobs with minimal to no downsides.
There was no benefit or higher rank other than being a receptionist.
You’re given way too much work and paid very little.
No benefits, small hours, low salary
there are really no cons for this job

I really enjoyed working with the people on my unit. I had fantastic coworkers and my direct manager was an awesome advocate for her staff. It was a very exciting workplace where I got to contribute in a very meaningful way to peoples lives.
Pros include competitive pay, low cost benefits (if you make below a certain salary) and good management.
Good health insurance Multiple locations in the Mountain West Region As a not-for-profit company it qualifies you for Public Service Loan Forgiveness after working 10 years with on-time payments.
Location of the hospital is in central Denver
fun/busy/fast paced/exciting/good pay and good benefits
Amazing benefits , hsa, and caregivers
Benefits are cheap and amazing. IMED has really I creased their security presence and it feels like a very safe place to work. They do not tolerate violence directed at staff from any patient and will escort patients out if they are violent or threatening.
Love the poeple working there, they are passionate about what they do, and it shows!
Great team environment at both locations Flexibility in scheduling
Decent benefits for existing employees, though limitations on some of those as they are taking over healthcare organizations in other states

So SCL is now Intermountain and I feel that those at the corporate office that do orientation are wonderful people. I'm sure they also have many offices that run well and are better than the one I'm reviewing now. Loved the small clinic atmosphere. A couple of the employees were good and you could trust them. Benefits were good. I had to take a paycut coming from Centura but whatever right. Loved my provider, my schedule, and the patients.

I’ve worked at other companies and this is my favorite
Tons of networking internal to the organization
Constantly learning, empowers employees to learn and grow, many opportunities
Big company that’s well known and reputable
Pretty good place to work. Have a good culture
N/a. Since the merger with Scl it’s been a nightmare. No notable pros.
First hand experience working with nurses and doctors
No pros to speak of
Intelligent and passionate individuals. Everyone rallies together during COVID.
Benefits time off department management - LDS Hospital BMT people culture
Annual raises are back, performance based increase, paid based on experience and accomplishments
People in the company are very welcoming They are ready to help They offer free learning resources and tuition coverage
Work/life balance can be pretty good. Professional development exists.
There are plenty of amazing healthcare providers where I work. They have an amazing air of wanting to teach and help coworkers improve. I'd say for every 1 bad coworker or provider, there are easily 5-10 good ones. People will give you advice if you ask for it, help you when needed, and there's a general attitude of ""let's embrace the suck together"" which can really be what you need to get through a rough shift. Basically, the people I work with are what really get me to stay and really see a future here.
Great people to work with.
Opportunity for growth, on the job training.
Love the team I work with.
The work itself is fine, a lot of the people are nice, and its can be fun.
Good coworkers-enjoyed my job 99% of the time. I went into healthcare because I like helping others-and my coworkers felt the same most of the time.
Benefits Competitive pay Opportunity to move within the company
The hospitals are well built and equipment is nice.
I work as one of the internal travel positions that goes between all 4 Hospitals that SCL owns in the Denver Metro area and beyond, solely working in the ER at all locations. You receive a diff on top of your base pay that allows it to be worth it. It varies from experience and certifications, but the pay range if ~$18-$26/hr for base pay excluding the differential for my position.
Differential given for night shift
They have increased in how much they pay
Ratios were decent 1:4-5 MS but recently changed to 1:5 day 1:6 night
Fair pay, great boss, accommodating to schedules
Pay and insurance are the few pros
Amazing company, willing to work with you and your schedule. Taken care of.
Great people to work with.
Opportunity for growth, on the job training.
Benefits that get more expensive every year, some tuition assistance, good patient ratio at Spanish Fork at least.
Always up to date with latest supplies, equipment, buildings

Health care industry is growing
Facilities are newer, clean and visually appealing.
On the cardiac unit at Saint Mary's, there is a lot of team work and the staff is very friendly
They have great PTO, benefits, coworkers
is a job, does have air conditioning
Okay benefits, shifts are 5-5
Healthcare is here to stay and Intermountain is a major healthcare system so this provides some degree of security New management trends are pushing to update the culture to a more modern agenda in line with main stream companies across the country.
I like the group of people I work with
Great work life balance. People are truly mission-focused and patient centered
Good pay fair work good support system
Mostly work from home position (they are now requiring one day a month in office).
I absolutely ADORE the ultrasound team I work with. They are extremely helpful, patient, and strive to be the absolute best in what they do. Intermountain has generous EAP benefits for intermittent therapy. Good options for investing in retirement accounts. I am fortunate that I was hired before the pension program was cut.

People, leadership, beliefs, and location
Laboratory personnel were great! Truly miss my boss, supervisor, and fellow associates! I hope I can find a new position that compares to my experience at Saint Joseph Hospital!
Some of the pros in working at an Intermountain clinic was the team work and the busy atmospheric schedules of each unique providers. Working with the doctor I was assigned and having a set busy schedule everyday.
Benefits were pretty decent but you could only go to IH clinics essentially
Good company to work for. Good employee recognition.
The Manager I have is awesome.
Flexible schedule was offered Great co-workers Benefits were decent PTO Paid training and development and continuous education
The ability to work remote is fantastic.
Flexibility to work from home once you put in time with the company Management is very approachable Pay is decent Bonuses every 6 months
","Hourly pay isn't great, but the environment makes up for it.
Upper management is a bloated and bureaucratic nightmare which had been getting progressively worse during the time I worked there. It was abundantly clear that the needs of staff were at the bottom of the priority list and often patient safety was sacrificed to the profit motive as well. An excellent example of this attitude was the lack of any kind of danger pay or bonus for working during the pandemic, while they simultaneously slashed our benefits. Thanks Intermountain, you're a big part of the reason I left the healthcare field.
Despite completing my bachelor's degree and having a strong work ethic, I am trouble finding opportunities to advance in my career within Intermountain Health for several months now. In my department, we are also implementing simple technology (online prescription refilling) that will greatly benefit our patients and employees that could've easily been put into place years ago. We also lack digital scanners/portable computers to help maintain our inventory numbers. Everything has to be counted by hand, then go back to your computer and adjust the quantities. It can be very time consuming when you dispense hundreds of medications. In other words, they are slow (or maybe just cheap) to install new and updated tech.
The entire culture keeps getting reinvented as new CEOs come and go, always reinventing the wheel. Pay has not kept up with growth in Utah. Mid-level management values business connections over clinical experience. No opportunities for growth into leadership within my field. Does not pay doctorate level non-medical professionals consistent with their education debt. Each hospital has its own work culture, with some being more dog-eat-dog than others.
No career development No bonuses based on experience or performance Bad COVID benefits (only pay up to 24 hours of leave) They cap you for PTO even if you work overtime No support of nurses’ mental health - one nurse recently committed suicide and leadership did not do anything to increase benefits or anything substantial to help with our stress or laid time off Change things often and for financial benefit of Intermountain, not for better workflow of nurses or patients
strict time policies hard to heal self
Not a good fit for people that don’t like non-profit culture and business strategies
Healthcare is hard everywhere you go
Compensation is not great, and the leadership team always felt very far away.
Once you're short staffed it takes a while to hire new people Some locations have larger work loads per RD
As they have expanded their healthcare reach, their benchmarks are trying to make apples into oranges. Patient outcome priorities are very different in Utah than in other states, and not always in good ways. Our unique culture within our communities and our existing legacies are threatened in the name of consistency, not allowing our facilities to meet the needs of those we serve. Morale has tanked among our staff and long-time, loyal teammates have had their positions eliminated. The focus seems to be on the bottom line instead of the best patient care possible, and senior leadership seems uninterested in investing in the future.
management support safety outdated equipment safety
Understaffed at the time but much better now i hear
-very busy units -hit or miss with ratios
Management sucks. They have favoritism and if you aren’t in that list they will talk bad about you or even attack your person. The MA’s run the clinic and was to mange everyone even though it’s not their job too HR is no help they will always defend the Manager actions is always correct even if it’s not
Healthcare benefits are expensive No Pension, Low compensation, High cost of living Bedside RNs are treated unprofessionally, Mandatory Overtime No lunch breaks (they just make you take a higher ratio of patients while another nurse takes her lunch)
Low pay Management above managers seem to not care
Sometimes we are understaffed, which places a greater burden on the teams.
Pay is bad. No incentives. They will never pay what they should.
Middle management heavy, leaders seem disconnected or out of touch with those of us that are individual contributors.
-very busy units -hit or miss with ratios
Low night shift differentials, low pay compared to cost of living, not a diverse culture, low morale, hard to feel valued as a team member.
Absolutely terrible place to work. Complete disorganization. The right hand doesn’t know what the left is doing. The administration is clueless and doesn’t care at all for staff or patients, only themselves. They can’t keep help and are losing medical providers left and right. Almost all of providers at the hospital are locums and they managed to chase off all of the very well established orthopedic surgeons, and several other really good family med and OB doctors.
Low pay Management above managers seem to not care
Like I mentioned in pros taking a pay cut but it wasn't the end of the world it wasn't a huge cut. Things started ok but progressed in a negative manner. The MA that I shared an office with refused to show me around and orient me to the job. She made racial comments on occasion (pointed towards me). She started complaining to our supervisor that I wasn't helping, If you won't let someone help to begin with or show them how to do certain tasks then how are you supposed to help. This MA's provider also started attacking me. I would over hear them talking about patients in a very negative way. Mind you that this specialty clinic covers a sensitive condition and the provider is a surgeon for this condition. I attempted to let my supervisor know but got reprimanded. I said something to her boss and again got reprimanded. I gave a two week notice and wasn't allowed to carry it out and was told that I never said anything about a two week notice. In the beginning everyone was so happy that I was there, the honeymoon phase wears off and the attacks begin.

Middle management heavy, leaders seem disconnected or out of touch with those of us that are individual contributors.
Pay could have been better.
Benefits are worse than in the past. More expectations for productivity because costs are skyrocketing.
Nights and weekends when you first start
You slowly lose aspirations, general experience
RTO is filled quickly. Don't expect any time off for the rest of 2023 unless you call out.
Toxic leaders favor a hierarchical and authoritarian management style. Terrible HR. The Compliance Hotline/department is a career trap. Some Supply Chain individuals in positions of power abuse their authority and create a toxic work environment. Under the influence of confident toxic supply chain leaders, team members experience chronic stress, anxiety, and burnout. The turnover rate is ridiculously high, but no one cares. There is constant pressure to meet unrealistic expectations and fear of retribution for perceived mistakes, creating an unhealthy and unsustainable work environment. Furthermore, these toxic leaders favor a hierarchical and authoritarian management style. They often prioritize their interests over the team’s and the organization’s well-being. The new interviewing process is ridiculous! Best of luck surviving there!
Board is a complicated mix of largely high-dollar donors, many employee-facing support resources are outsourced, insurance plans in Utah are tied to it's sister company Select Health, heavy spending on marketing and sponsorships
Low night shift differentials, low pay compared to cost of living, not a diverse culture, low morale, hard to feel valued as a team member.

Too much turn over during COVID due to low pay. Intermountain health needs to match the market

Slow to implement ideas or changes.
Can be difficult to be promoted without a degree. Some management should be flexible and more compassionate to their employees situations. Some managers micromanage which creates a hostile environment. Some managers need better management/personal skills. There are a lot of great managers but there are some rotten apples that need to be plucked out.
Overwhelming updates, no effective systems, Poor communication, no professional and Ethical behaviors, Chaos environment and covering up the non-efficient operations, favoritism, and political non health working environments which lead to unfairness for the other staff.
Normal healthcare stressors and little room for growth
Nothing to share at current time
Lots of turnover, training sometimes inadequate
Everything else. Low pay, nutrition dept is undervalued, HR is slow, raises outside of the 2-3% are abnormal, overworked and underpaid
Could have a higher rate of pay
Horrible management and leadership. No one knows what the other is doing since the merger and no one seems to be talking about it. It’s painfully sad how oblivious they are or how oblivious they assume we are. Not sure which.
Sometimes the hours are not the best
Pretty much everything about this company
Lack of organization from system leaders; hospital nursing leadership resistant to change (big fish, very small pond).
upper management pay is lower than the average
No profit sharing, bonuses or other pay incentives.
There is not a lot of diversity People are stuck in their ways and do not like change
Compensation and career growth seem to be stagnant while integration with SCL Health goes through. Re-orga have been frequent over the past few years.
Management is... well management. There are great managers, mediocre managers, and some that just aren't great. That statement applies to all levels of management. With Intermountain integrating with what was SCL, some positions are being threatened with being let go simply because ""the rest of Intermountain doesn't have this position"". Good managers are getting pushed out for similar reasons or because someone who is a brown-noser wants something different even though they have no experience in that sector/specialty. Think of your classic healthcare shenanigans, ""Heroes work here!"" but your market adjustment counts as your raise, even though that was to keep you competitive with other employers so people would stop leaving. Also, they'll offer a new hire a 5k - 15k signing bonus (depending) but if you already work for them ""you should be happy to have a job"" mentality is palpable.
Low pay and benefits con.
Low pay compared to other companies.
New Grad programs wasn't very helpful
Some of the people really bring down the mood of the workplace and are too stubborn to leave, management is changing a lot with a lot of policies that don't make sense (i.e. can't call out more than 8 times a year or you will be terminated), and the pay should be higher. They didn't give me raises for switching departments. I know a lot more than a lot of other people and I get paid less. Raises in general are handles poorly, as new people starting make more than people who have worked there for 2 years. The best way to get a good raise is to quit for 6 months and come back.
Very “political” no matter what department I worked in. I don’t play the “games” that must be played to be favored to get the special treatment or days off you want or need. I work hard, and that is what counts! We were always short staffed and it was so hard to be taking care of 10+ patients and yet expected to be perfect and not ever miss anything or be behind -we had to be perfect! And I get patient care is critical-but you can’t run your staff into the ground! People could not do it! The team work was no longer because people were just trying to survive. And favoritism was definitely seen.
Work life balance can be difficult Poor diversity in staffing
After working for the company for almost 2 years I did not qualify for any paid maternity leave because my average hours a week for the year before my daughter’s birth was <20 hours a week. I was in school and had a difficult pregnancy so I went down from 24/hrs a week to 12. I wasn’t expecting full-time pay during my maternity leave, but something would have been nice!
If you don't like driving a lot, the internal traveler position isn't for you. Every ER has a different way of going about doing tasks in the ER, so it makes it hard to remember the exact way of doing stuff. However, they are understanding of the internal traveler position and are nice about correcting you. Some locations are extremely busy and have high acuity patients, and some are extremely slow and have low acuity patients. So, you may like or dislike either, depends on you, mostly.
Pay for base pay rate
Always want you to do more with less. I spend hours answering messages which I’m not paid for, in reality. I feel like my own secretary
Ratios and acuity are getting worse
Nothing I can say at this time
Management won't deal with employees who show up to just do nothing all day. They promoted the wrong people. Everyone knew it was a mistake to promote the laziest person to receiving. Now he gets paid more and it's expected that we all help him because he won't do his own job.
Having to enforce masks on an unwilling public.
Low pay and benefits con.
Low pay compared to other companies.
Pay is low, lots of extra trainings, meetings, long onboarding for new nurses.
Need better pay and pto
New Grad programs wasn't very helpful
They pay very little compared to cost of living

No policy and procedures guide so conflicting directions based on who trained you. Mgmt does not follow any of the six company Values. Zero Team behaviors. People come onto and leave the team with no announcements or welcomes. If you transfer to another department you are told you cannot say goodbye for fear those remaining will be worried about the exodus.
The pay here is awful. Patient ratios are unsafe since management expects to staff us short every single shift. This pay is not worth the stress.
The medical benefits could be better and they have made it more difficult to for staff to work PRN/per diem
Not so great managers, hiring process, or transfer process
only getting more corporate and out of touch
Rebrand feels like they don’t care. No unions.
New management trends are pushing to update the culture to a more modern agenda in line with main stream companies across the country.
Lots of change with the new merger.
Pay is below market rate
Low hours when there aren't any patients to treat
Not allowing 100% work from home as it is now required to work in the office once a month.
I feel that the benefits of working at Intermountain have worsened in the past 5 years. No pension, no guaranteed Christmas bonuses, VERY limited party budgets, etc. It's the small things that Intermountain takes away that really hit the hardest. When we celebrate big anniversaries for our coworkers, we have pay ourselves and it feels silly. I want to work in a place where friendships between coworkers are really celebrated and encouraged... who wants to work with a bunch of strangers? Also- I absolutely LOATHE the current IT team. It is awful calling a tech in a different country and having to fix problems over the phone. I understand it decreases costs, but it's just impractical and obnoxious.

Salary can vary widely at any level
I do not have any complaints.
Something’s this company could do better is paying workers biased on the skills they provide. Also having stable workers that don’t get in and get out in a matter of a couple months.
Management needs to be trained to manage and micromanage. Expectations were unfair and hiring was biased towards friends of managers without any real experience in healthcare
Not many opportunities to move up in the company.
Self sign ups are a joke.,
Pay could be better Management Burn-out
Recent issues with the SCL merger make this a less desirable position.
Benefits are expensive especially for families. Lots of meetings that could just be an email

Working from home was a very nice perk; you did not have to worry about traveling

Friendly co-workers, decent pay. Great trainers, full time job.
fun employees, good place to get by
Snack room on premises to purchase snacks.
Decent pay for what you’re doing
Good in training people and provides opportunity for growth.
Offer really great schedule flexibility
Good place to work with good hours
Work from privacy of home Company paid training
The business casual dress code now includes jeans, so its pretty much wear whatever you want there. hair,piercings are totally cool. pay is OKAY but not good for all the crap you put up. points system is pretty good to work with except in transition when they only give you 2.5 points to last a whole 5 weeks.
They do train you and pay you fairly well in comparison to what other call centers offered to start. I had never been in a call center doing this type work and they helped me to learn a new job and paid me like I said, well in comparison. I use to make more at an old unrealated job and it has been an anjustment taking a lower pay but I can't complain really.
- Good managers who talk nicely to employees, no name calling - Flexibility in schedule, can run errands during office hours by compensating those either early morning or in the evening/night - Easy to get a job here. Not several rounds of interviews. Managers are anxious to know if you'd be willing to join the company - Few people are very smart but most people are extremely hard working - Downtown office, can check out restaurants during lunch time - Cubes are nice and spacious and also can hear from office if reds won or if it was just home run! - good dental and vision insurance
Convergys has one main client 'DirectTV/ATT', $9.25 but temporarily had a new client 'Humana' SUPPOSE to be active from the months of November 27, 2017 - May 31, 2018. The best part of the job was the pay, $11/hr. That is all.
Really nice and supported community.
Awesome co-workers and immediate management. You'll make great friends and work in a good environment. I've had a lot of fun here.
They hire just about anyone and pay you for training. There are benefits, full time, work at home opportunities. Recruiting is friendly and tries to put that place with a positive spin. Great for High School and recent High School Graduates. If you ever make Team Leader or Management, you're lucky.
The opportunity to move quickly ""up the ladder"" is definitely there. This opportunity is there only if you want it and you are there to work and work very well. If you use the excuse that you've been there for 3 months and deserve a raise based on your time there, that's a joke wherever you work- so drop that. If you show up and show your skills on an every single day basis, you will be known. The pay was helpful and took me from behind my bills to months ahead. Considering the fact that that's on my budget, my bills, my financial portfolio, this can't be said for everyone. I don't have kids, I just have student loans and small living expenses to pay for. The people were, for the most, very cool and fun to work with.
Quick and easy hiring process. Nice and friendly HR people. Being able to work at home. Excellent trainers who seem to care about the trainees.
Consistent pay, friendly people, feel useful, almost no dress code, varied scheduling, casual atmosphere, music
Nice co workers and some nice leaders
The location I worked at was fun, and the perks for working on holidays was a nice touch. I was able to take time off at the last minute if I needed to take one of my kids to an appointment or needed an extra day off using my vacation time. Management aside from maybe 2 were very approachable and understandable of life events etc. The site director was always walking around talking with employees and easy to take too. Again, it depends on the location, but my co-workers were great, I lft with a lot of friends.
Depending on what department you work in, the actual job itself is not bad. It's easy and enjoyable.
I learned quite a bit.
I worked as a work at home (WAH) agent which is a great pro, the work to life ratio is much greater with a work at home job. The work commute is from the living room to the office, so there is no time stuck in traffic or high transportation costs. It was great to be able to design and organize my the work space how I wanted.
Work from Home decent hours nice Supervisors
Not physically demanding Your only real responsibility is maintaining your ""stats"" such as phone time adherence, schedule adherence, average handle time, etc Generally liked most of the people I worked with. Flexible attendance and absenteeism plan. Was once absent over 30 times in a year and thanks to working the system only had 3 count. A hell of a lot better than McDonalds or Wal-Mart
You get a pay check. Other than that I can't say much for the place.
This is a fun place to work! Your able to make a lot of friends. Monthly incentive bonus if you can manage to hit your Average Handle Time, and conversion rate metrics. They have a Stat based Shift bid like every 6 months. So if you get stuck with a bad shift like I night shift till 11pm, if you work hard and raise your stats you can earn a better shift.
Easy training process. Benefits and pay.
They are lenient. The regional program manager worked her way up by having ""good working relationships.""
Many of the positions allow you to be off on the weekends and they do promote from within and allow you to switch to other positions or ""projects""... so there are opportunities for advancement however it is not easy to get reassigned unless the project you are working on closes or unless you have near perfect attendance.
It is fairly easy to get hired (due to the high turnover rate). There is a training period (although you should not count on it alone to prepare you for the sales floor). It pays at least $10.00/hr (and there are sales bonuses, even if they are not realistic).
Work takes very little intellectual challenge (you are reading from a script and trying to sell extra things to callers interested in the product they are trying to order) The schedules are consistent, once you are situated you will probably be there for a while Great for building sales skills (since you have to upsell to callers)
Training is the BEST part of this job, the trainers are awesome, and the first four weeks we learned a lot of valuable information, especially about our primary partner (Dell). Work environment isn't stressful, but metrics are everything. Easy to get a job. Ever make your own computer or repair a computer before? They will hire all walks of life. Great place to work as a student, after the first couple months, they will tailor your schedule to your school schedule.
Got to work on the OnStar team, with all the GM benefits and perks, which was good.
On the job fun, contests, music and friendly people and motivational environment.
People who work there are generally friendly. Facilities are nice.
Sit around and basically do nothing for four weeks of paid training. This won't be for everyone, but I had quality colleagues. Upper management were down-to-earth people, as well. All in all, nice people. This isn't necessarily a pro of you don't like it, but music is played on the production floor. It isn't a stuff office space that you might think it is.
None None None None None
I was happy that the application process was quick and easy, and I started working within just a two weeks from applying. Training was great and the instructors made sure that you were prepared to do the job. Pay was better than my previous jobs, being $10.00/hour, and you had the potential to get a raise every 6 months based on attendance. Steady 40 hours/week, and option of overtime.
there are 0 pros other then they supposedly offer work from home this is a scam convergys does not honor contracts or pay employees
-Steady hours -Benefits -Somewhat clean work stations -Ample parking -Clean Bathrooms -Storage for personal affects during shifts
It is a job. The experience can be a stepping stone to employers that treat their people well.
If you're on everyone's good side and keep your head down, you could probably skate by for years if you're just looking for a paycheck.
There is definitely opportunity to make money via overtime. And a lot of the people are nice here. And it's full-time with benefits.
Training was not too bad. It was a fixed schedule, and though there were many trainers, we did learn, and got paid $9.00/hour. The HR department does a good job posting fake reviews.
The best thing I can say is that my three years there allowed me to pay the bills while going to school. I had a supervisor who tried to do right by us, but was cowed and threatened by operations management.
Great benefits package. I don't want to say lenient, but ""forgivable"" attendance policy, you essentially have to willing want to get fired to be let go based solely on attendance.
Easy application process, mass hiring, no experience necessary, three weeks of paid-training provided where each week had a testing requirement in order to pass onto the next week, weeding out the individuals who would be unable to satisfactory complete the job, usually due to unfamiliarity with computers.
Training is becoming more up to par. Looks like they are training TLs a little better
I was a work from home agent so there were pros of being home, not having to buy work clothes, not having to worry about the commute especially since my car was down at the time and I saved money from these things. Paid training and the supervisors were friendly.
There were times when incentives were good and we were able to make decent money. I had some great coworkers.
Good pay for what you're doing. You start gaining paid time off from the first day of training. A lot of team leaders will work with you if you need to take a day off for something important. 12 point attendance system and points will fall off within a rolling year (for example, if you called off on May 12, the next year on May 12 you will gain the point back for it). You can also earn points back by getting 50 Convergys bucks, working when point earn backs are offered, or having perfect attendance for 30 days straight. Also, you can apply for benefits within the first 30 days, but there are also more opportunities every 6 months to apply again if you miss the date.
If you need a job, this pays well (relative to other low-level jobs out there), especially during training. The KEY is to keep looking for a better job and use them while you are training. Otherwise, you will definitely be the one who is used and thrown out with the trash.
- Friendly work environment - Provide free meals and prizes throughout the year - Decent health benefits - Lenient when it comes to family problems or time needed off
Working from home away from people. Saving money on gas. Staying away from petty drama. Less germs. Less traffic in the comfort of my own home.
Everything I would have listed here ended up being false.
Not much. About the only thing I can think of is pto accumulates at a decent rate-about 1 day for every month worked. Some of the team leaders are really good and actually care about the employees under them.
You can get a job if you need a job. Paid Training The people.
Good place to work with good hours
-training was good -meet great people
The people you meet and train with are for the most part awesome. Made some good friends there, Most of the Team leads on the Dell side are good to.
Decent customer service experience on your resume, solid training, consistent paycheck.
Great training for new employees. Benefits were pretty good. Got to work with many different kinds of people. Pay was better than minimum wage.
There is nothing to speak of here.
Good potential to move up to another position. As long as you have 6 points or less and good stats you can move up. Even if you don't get the position you apply for they will make you an intern for that position to help you get the experience. There's not much need to call out bc you can always VGH (voluntarily going home) at certain times of the day, Pretty cool people to work around. If you can make it to a position off the phones you have a chance at loving the job.
A good company to start out to get experience but if you don't move up every 2 years the salary increase is very little to none. Get the hell out. Managers are not well trained in their position. Attendance policy is laxed.
-$10/hr base pay starting out -Monthly sales commission -Decent health benefits (eye, dental, and medical) -40+ hours a week -UTO & PTO
They don't discriminate against anyone who needs a job.
Like any job your manager can make or break an experience, so I am being this strictly on the corporation as an employer. You can earn paid time off. Direct deposit.
Willing to give just about anyone with a pulse a chance to work there. For the most part, the front-line workers are okay. Direct deposit and health benefits are nice.
Before I took the job I had read a lot of negative reviews but none of them turned out to be true. I started out in a temporary project and now have a full time job. The management has shown genuine concern over agents being sick; not driving in bad weather (""don' risk yourself we had rather you be safe then get here"" ... direct quote); family pproblems and other legitimate reasons for missing work. A call center is not for everyone - it is very hard at times - but I have found the company to be fair and I plan on staying.
I have enjoyed working at Convergys. The overall company has many good people working for them. I have enjoyed working there due to Management Style and Team Members. Overall they were fair and honest. They have great benefits for you and your family.
-training was good -meet great people
Overall good benefits, like the referral program, ot offered. Looking forward to the incentive payouts I will hopefully get. Like that my team leader is helping us while we are still in training. He is very supportive and now we feel we have someone that can answer our questions and has been coching us. I like that the person that is going to be our manager is always checking up on us.
The people you meet and train with are for the most part awesome. Made some good friends there, Most of the Team leads on the Dell side are good to.
Decent customer service experience on your resume, solid training, consistent paycheck.
Great training for new employees. Benefits were pretty good. Got to work with many different kinds of people. Pay was better than minimum wage.
There is nothing to speak of here.
I am in training for the RCI (timeshare) project. They have a very structured training program that I feel is setting me up for great success, and the trainer we've had is very knowledgeable. I haven't done much with sales in the past, so this is new territory for me. I am getting excited about all the commissions they offer (they call them ""incentives"") on top of an hourly wage ($12 an hour). It's also been a lot of fun learning about different travel destinations all over the world. The customers are nice for the most part. There are also great little perks for employees that work hard and have good attendance.
Decent pay, benefits, PTO, relatively flexible attendance system, diverse work environment, expectations are communicated, training is slightly more extensive than other call centers (therefore you have more opportunity to learn), good job for college (if you’re attending classes part-time), strong possibility of overtime (food is also provided on said days)
Convergys is a great job, especially if you are the type that would like to avoid factory environments. You do have to be able to catch on quickly to new concepts, as well as being able to accomplish multitasking between screens. There are lots of motivational perks that occur to encourage everyone to do their best.

The pay is decent if you consider starting anywhere from $10- at least $14 per hour. Training is Exceptional and will definitely give you an idea of whether or not you are capable of learning how to manipulate your way through the various Customer Service screens to answer Customer questions about pricing and their credit card billing etc. and of course set orders...which of course all depends on the Contract you will be assigned to work for such as Wall Street Journal; selling newspaper no outbound calls; among a few other Companies Convergys Contract with.

Time off. You get almost 2 weeks vacation and can take 8 more days (unpaid) too-- 2 per quarter of the year. You can take it in increments as small as 2-hours.. You don't have sick time though. I guess this is it.
Pay is a little below a living wage, but above minimum (~10/hr in Sirius, ~13/hr in Dell, AT&T works off commission). Work is dead easy, if droll. If it wasn't for my coworkers, I wouldn't still be working here. Great coworkers make a 'just enough' wage a lot more enticing than ending up in a job with better pay that I couldn't stand to be at.
CVG is a very dynamic outsourcer customer care company, that quickly has to move to support our external client requirements. Many of our senior leadership got their start working in the call center. If you can perform you can excel. However, CVG does have to make changes based on client requirements, and that includes ending projects, as while as starting new ones. However, if you can survive the chaos, you can excel and move fairly rapidly up the corporate ladder in call center operations, as well as sales and marketing.
","Higher reviews for employees trying hard and helping customers.
Poor management and needless pressure on employees
Needs better team management, support on the floor and flexibility with emergency off days.
Sitting for a long period of time.
Worked you more than you was getting paid. No breaks most the time
Management is all drama queens.
Some of the shifts are not freat.
None I can think of
The micro management was horrendous!
Very high volume call center
Care more about numbers than humans.
Bad management revolving door of employees
Bad management. Unprofessionalism. Customers always treated you like a doormat. Points system for absences.
The long hours and the ride customers
No retirement benefit even after completing 5 years of service
Upper management often played favorites
Some legacy systems could be updated
Pay was not competitive Training was not consistent with Campaign Unnecessary micro managing in some areas which takes away from productivity
They do not care about the individual person or their needs. Need time off? Someone in your family die? Got a doctors appointment? You better hope you somehow magically planned any emergencies at least 5 weeks in advance otherwise you have to take the points and risk getting fired. All of the TLS/SUPERVISORS/TSS take their jobs way too seriously and think they are above all the call agents. asking for help is impossible. the training is 5 weeks long 3 in the class spent listening to someone talk about meaningless things. 2 weeks is spent thrown onto the phones trying to learn a very complicated multi step system on each call. day one of floor transistion you have to take about 20-50 calls and try to get each call under 10 min long,while running and trying to use 9 different windows AND if you need help your only option is a java chat where you have to wait for a response from a ""coach"" for over 10 minutes. this place is a joke. if you like highschool drama and people walking around with complexes and egos go work here. the moneys okay,but not for all the mental people you have to deal with and lack of teamwork.
They deal with a lot of very young first time being employed people. You as well as management has to deal with inappropriate behaviour a lot. Management does not at times deal with us employees as adults. At times I have never been so uninformed and not been given what the options are when big changes are happening; such as, a big contract being lost you've been on and possible layoffs ahead. Management didn't talk to me, its like you get much of the information through other employees which is so unofficial and making you not know for sure who is correct with the information because it is unofficial. They (Convergys) have very strange ways of handling things at times because of this lack of management putting it out officially for us to see in company e-mail and such. It is truly unlike any other place I've worked for, and I've been around enough to know. The job is stressful at times and especially for the first few months or so. Some people it is just too much stress and they leave. Very high turnover rate, like many call centers are I've heard.
- No work/life balance, IMG employees work overtime consistently including weekends, some employees even work during time-offs - Products are not very difficult to understand but employees have complicated things immensely by introducing various processes (even after CEO said that we've complicated things unnecessarily, nobody wants to take off their NASA scientist hats) - Compensation is below average, employees who joined after 2001 (dot com burst) are on much lower salary - Even after winning several contracts, the raises are not even 1% for most employees - Recently changed to UMR health insurance which is crap!
The project actually ended early, February 23, 2018, bc of call volume and we were notified that the project was not moving forward the last week of January. BUT the director told us to compensate for the project ending early, all Humana agents would transfer to work on the DirectTV project as long as we didn't have attendance problems (9 points), no conduct issues, background, drug test, & ATT had to be hiring. On Feb. 15th and 16th, Convergys had an open house for full-time positions for DirectTV. Around this time is when they finally gave us the drug test paper work we were promised 2 weeks prior to. On Feb. 20th, just 3 days short of the Humana Project ending, the Director meets with us again to tell us that we will no longer be moving over to DirectTV/ATT. The entire management team is unprofessional and their actions are questionable, but when you confront them with your questions, they get defensive and attack you instead. They will lie so constantly, they forget their own lies. It's honestly the worst job I ever had. I would dread coming to work, especially when we realized convergys pulled an okie-doke on us. Everyone hates their job and the 'owner' stresses everyone out to the max, some admin employees sleep in their offices.
Where do I begin... If you speak another language beside English, it's a great job. I applied for the English position (the only one that I could) and we had to take calls for another company. How it works is that people called in to troubleshoot their product if they have the warrenty or contract for their product. like 80%(I assume) of the calls that comes in are English. The English speaking agent would take call constantly(sometime in a day without stoping) and then when there is too much call that the English speaking agents can't handle it, then the (Spanish/ Portuguese speaker takes the call). That's not all of it. They make like a dollar or 2 more (depending on the language )than the English speaker. I'm not blaming the agents here. There was this agent (Spanish speaking)who I was worked with told me ""We have to take calls because you guys are too lazy to answer the calls"" Like we don't take enough calls. There would be days where I wold go home and have a sore throat and kept working, but I just had it with the unfairness.
Pay, benefits, corporate decisions specifically regarding health insurance, tuition reimbursement and how much power the management has to help their employees.
The recruiting is a bit of a lie. They like to hook you with one job, but try to toss you into another one. The inside is like a maze, packed with a very low caliber of people. There are rules, but hardly enforced such as a dress code. They want you to dress at least Business Causal, but you see plenty of people in sweat pants, t-shirts, jeans, low cut tops, tanks, leggings, stretch pants (and not just one casual Friday. I'm speaking of a typical Monday morning) There are fights, right ups, and a lot of other things you would see if you were in high school. Terrible for experience adult unless possibly working from home. VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE!! Low salary, just above minimum wage for most jobs. Training is basically reading these very simple guides and seeing if you know how to browse a webpage. 4 weeks of this what could take 2-3 days.
The time spent at the job outweighed the pay because of the stress that it puts onto the lack of personal time you get away from the job. Expectations were unrealistic and they provided little action to help me get to the expectations they had in place for me. This created a marry-go-round effect where taking time off was a pain because they didn't have anyone to cover the job so working nearly 60 hours a week was sabotaging my sanity. Payroll really sucks. They moved me from hourly to salary without my written consent. It seems like each team for the project had different goals that didn't line up with each other.
MICROMANAGEMENT! If you've never had a job where your EVERY minute was monitored and your every decision questioned then you will not be prepared to work for Convergys at Home. Awful Production Team Leaders / Supervisors. The Supervisors never help you in a timely or helpful manner and are generally rude to reps. Being a work at home rep means all of your interaction while taking calls will be through chat so if you have any issues you need help with to handle a call you have to put it in chat and WAIT until a Supervisor or Assistant responds. Despite having to wait for answers to questions you will get dinged/coached for having longer calls. Crappy and Expensive Health Insurance -- Convergys uses a health insurance provider (Blue Cross of Ohio so obviously there will be no in-network providers if you live outside Ohio. Halfway decent coverage is expensive yet still has high co-pays and deductibles. Underpaying for Work Time -- When I worked at Convergys the company illegally said that it would not pay reps for time spent with Convergys Tech handling rep computer issues. I say illegally because there is a class action lawsuit which Convergys is settling and agreeing to pay for employee time. Also note, Convergys Supervisors have full control over your time reports for payroll and can and do alter them when they fit.
HR and recruiters do pretty much nothing. If your timesheet is messed up due to nobody EVER fixing it no matter how often you remind them, it may or may not get fixed. If you need to leave the company on good terms with zero punctuality issues and your numbers consistently above average intending to go back in a few months, they will tell you you're good to go when you check back in and then when it's time to start - OOPS! Suddenly there's a glitch, apparently you're showing in the system as being three hours late to work every day or never showing up because of this scheduling error even though you asked every other day to get it fixed (and were assured each time that it would be, or that it didn't matter) and were actually *early* every single time and it can be easily proven by simply checking actual work history since we all use our IDs for every single chat we take - no worries, we'll get this fixed by tomorrow! *proceed to never speak to you again, blow you off when you try to contact them*
classic call center grind mill. low effort required, but low rewards too
The shift process sucked, always a revolving door for those that didnt perform. I got lucky, I pushed hard and was able to pick the first shift right out of training and I was moved into chat support which let me keep my shift for almost 3 years. Pay was ok at first, however in 3 years I only got a 44 cent raise. Communication with contract client was not always the best. Processes would be one thing one day, something else the next and then something else later on. Only go for a promotion if you have no family or are ok with working till midnight for awhile, again depends on contract and location. I received a promotion and was told i needed to work till midnight to ""get my feet wet"" and a shift bid would be done in a few months.
The problem is the money-hungry, most deceptive managers in the planet. They outright lie in your face on a daily basis. They literally will tell you ANYTHING you want to hear to get you out their faces. They have ""incentives"" that they won't pay you for if you don't physically go up and remind them about (which there is no reason why you should have to remind them about their own incentive). There are no such thing as raises at all. You can work there for 3 days and someone working there 3 years literally will have the same pay regardless of how long they have been there or how much of a good employee they at. If anything the bad employees are the ones who get rewarded, they get recognized for work they don't even do and get rewards they don't even deserve. By bad employees I mean people who literally take maybe 5 calls a day and are MIA for most of their shift, compared to good employees who take around 80 a day and do everything asked of them plus more. It's sad because you see a lot of people who have backgrounds who have no choice but to stay because not many places hire employees with a background. But there are some people who have so much potential but they have to stay there and be treated poorly and beyond under-appreciated.
No real promotions. If you miss to many days despite your great scores. You get let go. when Convergys bought out Stream Global. I love my job helping is what do, but it does not matter to them. But they do not value you. If you do to well then they keep you on the phones to keep the scores up. If you show any sign that you are unhappy, or complain you are marked with no promotion in site. I was told by 2 people that I would get a promotion. One person left and the other just lied to cover up the fact. If you want a career in the Tech industry or custom service. Go to school. I loved my job their, but when you get broken down so many times, you tend to give up the illusion that the company cares about you. So I am not saying don't work there, I am saying use caution because they dont care about anyone but themselves. I have talked to former management, there us favoritism. If they do promote people they act lije they are curing Cancer. The 1 ups as they call them treat you as if you are idiots, if you ask questions that you may or may not already know.
The biggest con was the low pay, customers assumed I was well paid due to the technical nature of the job, but the wage was so low the only thing that kept me working at the job that long was the WAH benefits. There were many technical issues over the years but Convergys had changed the software system they were using for WAH and the new one seemed more sensitive to lags in data which caused calls to drop at a much higher ratio than the old system.
This company has massive technical issues that they blame the employee for instead of taking responsibilities and if you make too high of the available incentive to often they find a reason to fire you. They blamed me for something I did not do and would not look at my stellar record as evidence that I would never place an order on a customer's account that did not order it. I processed 1000 calls per month. Due to their faulty technology inadvertently one customer out of thousands that I processed got Showtime on their account by mistake. Management did not show me proof of this they just let me go, after 18 months of stellar performance. I worked very hard to improve my performance month after month. Once I got to the point where I knew the job well and my sales were way above the quotas they claimed I placed Showtime on a customers account who said no to the offer. They were rigid and refused to own the technological problems they experience on a daily basis and look at the system. The commission on adding a product was a whopping $1.50, thousands of calls I processed and they took one account that was obviously a mistake and fired me for it rather than investigating and looking at my past performance. Plus they kept my last commission check that I earned which leads me to believe that if you perform well at this company they will manipulate out the door and keep money you honestly earned.
Where do I start Here's a big one. They encourage a hostile work environment. If you are being verbally abused by a customer over the phone management advises you that you are not allowed to hang up or escalate the call to your supervisor. Subpar pay, easily one of the lowest paying call center jobs in town Being an outsourced company management has surprisingly little commitment to the client. This means when the time for advancement rolls around your performance becomes secondary in favor of who you know and how well. The Client of out site had one of the most confusing and difficult systems for both agents and customers. Sometimes it took months to resolve simple issues. Hidden fees. Poor training and hiring. Just about everyone you work with is nice. It is a job where you have to be ok with being yelled at. However some of the people they put onto the production floor are just plain stupid. Pay raise is based off of attendance solely.
work almost every weekend second shift even if you're sick you're expected to work When I got hired I was told if I did well I could move to a better shift and I would get more weekends off. Once I was hired and had been working for a bit I was told since I work part time I was unable to change to an earlier shift. My stats were always great and I worked almost every weekend. (not just one day out of the weekend, but every weekend in its entirety). They have a point system and if you reach 12 points you are fired. The system often would log you in late, but if you didn't have a member of management to verify you were there on time it would still count against you. (you got a quarter of a point even if you were a minute late clocking in). There were jobs that didn't get posted but certain people were told about so they could apply. There was very obvious favortism with scheduling and getting time off when requested. Some were magically not seen by them even after your supervisor emailed them several times about the requested time off. All in all I was happy to have a job, but the stress and the late shift became too much for me.
Unorganized management structure. the Team Managers each have their own management style, some by the book on rules and some will let you get away with alot. It's like there is no ""official management method"" imposed by the Director. There is no room for advancement! they talk and talk about promoting from within, but the only way to get promoted is ""if"" they hire a new training class you and 15-20 other people get to apply for that ONE TM spot. I was passed over 4 times because I wasn't ""buddy buddy"" with enough of the current TM's to be considered. Pay starts at $9.50 we were told it would just up to $10 after training. when that time came it turns out...you can get a raise ""up to $10.00"" based on your stats. I got a raise to $10.05 and there are no yearly raises offered.
This job is very unprofessional, don’t waste your time with this company. While in training I missed one day due to sickness. I contacted my trainer personally and let him know a day ahead I was too sick to come in. He agreed that he would put me into another training class but never did. I tried to call for weeks, no one answered. I even went up to the job twice and no one could help me. They told me to re apply and maybe be hired again as a rehire. After giving up on being put into another training I simply just wanted my check for the time I was there. This process took over a month! I had to contact the ADP company to get in contact with Convergys! Again do not waste your time here! I even tried to come back a couple months later, went through the interviewing process, and was offered a job. Not only did they not hire me back, they told me they were no longer hiring rehires and they could not give me a job anywhere in Charlotte! So why even accept my application in the first place when it specifically asks on the application if you worked there before?
This was formerly Datacom. Bought by Convergys, then merged with Concentrix. It took 6 years to completely transition from Datacom to Convergys. The good old boys system worked pretty good. They were very traditional. Run by Malaysian-Indian men.
In reality most of the positions are little more than an answering service for the company we are calling or answering the phone for. We have little to no access to customer accounts and so cannot do anything to actually help the customer. This means that, much like working on an assembly line, we do 1 small task over and over and over again therefor bringing the boredom and tediousness of a normal call center to an all new level.
The systems don't always function (Note: You can't help a customer if you can't search for an issue). You are expected to navigate at least 7 windows at once while on the phone (Note: It may take anywhere up to 15 windows to resolve an issue). Managers ignore employees in need of help while on the phone (Note: They are required to provide support). Employees may be randomly subjected to abuse (Note: All calls are recorded and are used to humiliate employees in a group setting for ""educational purposes""). Sales bonuses are nearly impossible to achieve (Note: You can be disqualified even if you do somehow meet the criteria). You are expected to follow a very specific protocol on every call and may be disciplined for any call where you may have misspoken or forgotten a step (Note: Even if you do follow protocol, a manager may still evaluate your call negatively based on his or her interpretation of your tone, behavior, etc.). You are expected to push a product on the customer on every call, even if he or she is unwilling (Note: You can and will be fired for forgetting to make offers). And so much more...
Cubicle environment with little interaction with other employees, you are stuck to the phone most of the shift and are penalized for taking breaks longer than planned for. There is NO upward mobility in the company-all top managers and team leaders are recruited from the outside. I knew people who had been working for the company for 15 years and were still telemarketers on the call floor. Very boring work if you don't want something that is routine and requires little intellectual stimulation. You are forced to work at least one day of the weekend, and also very little flexibility when it comes to being scheduled on the holidays. If your shift falls on a holiday don't expect any way of getting off.
Dead-end job No room for advancement at all Only work here if you are young, or your first job, or desperately need it. There is barely any room for advancement, and even if you do, you only get a raise of 1$ per hour. I moved to Tampa 2 years ago, this was my first job, I was happy to just have a job back then, but I realize I should of moved on at least a year ago. You will only make 13$ an hour and you will either hate it or deal with it. There's no room for a raise.
When they hired me, I specifically asked them if I would have to work many weekends, because I had partial custody of my small children, and would need to be off work every other weekend. I was told I would have to work maybe one weekend a month. When I got most of the way through training, I was told I would have to work every weekend until I was promoted to management, and maybe even then. Every few months, you have to shift bid, hoping that you get the same schedule you had before, so that you don't have to rearrange your life, yet again, to match your work schedule. While in training, my gall bladder began to fail, so that, about a year into my job, I had to take what was supposed to be a two-week leave of absence, but because they screwed up, it turned into several months of me not being able to work and not being able to collect unemployment. This happened twice. They finally gave me an accommodation for my custody problem, but after a few months, they rescinded that. Then, after two years of employment, they fired me for getting a kidney stone and coming back to work with a doctor's note, calling that an ""unexcused absence."" Because of what they did, I have not been able to find another job since. I would not work for these people again if I were starving.
Not enough pay for the amount of hours you have to put in to complete basic required job duties in addition to the fun, contests, music and motivation.
Lousy management to the point of incompetence. Company policies seem to change week to week. Training is base, at best, and is very disorganized at least for Dell. Convergys expects the businesses under its wing to all operate the same and it is not possible. The pay is absolute trash, especially since the cost of living in Florida is ever rising. Good luck trying to support yourself without another job. Depending on which line of business you work for, the hours are also no good. Demand for overtime is always happening but may change on a whim. The ""benefits"" come as very costly insurance. Given that the pay is already low, the insurance takes out quite a big chunk out of that already low paycheck. Employees are basically nothing but a ""resource"" and are treated as such....meaning that everyone there is a throw-away asset, no matter how long they have been working there. Most do not seem to make it past a year.
Once you actually start talking on the phones you might be lost because you have two screens with hundreds of different websites you have to go to. Some of which weren't told to you in training. The floor managers don't really help you out, they just kind of walk by and tell you to figure it out yourself. All this while a customer is screaming in your ear and you having to follow your call flow. Oh, and always make an offer. If someone is irate about having a thousand dollar bill that they can't pay make sure you always offer them something. Absolutely silly that one. Yeah, they can't pay their bill, but offer them Directv I'm sure that won't frustrate them even more. *insert sarcastic eye roll.* Wasn't a big fan of the work times and schedule either. Having to work either Saturday or Sunday is no bueno, especially during football season. Breaks and lunches way too short. It's standard procedure, but still it's just too short.
For over 9 and 1/2 years and after earning several customer service awards, every time I asked my team leaders how my job performance was, I was always given a thumbs up, and they stated that all my statistics were within specs. The stressful conditions that were placed on employees were unbearable at times. People were fired for every type of statistic; from sales to high talk times. On this account, talk time counted as 35% of your grade and anything over this time was an automatic failure and termination was always threatened. The bottom 1/3 of people were automatically written up and could be fired, even though we had forced overtime and forced extra work days, if people were exhausted and stated that forced overtime was against labor laws, they were written up and and could be fired. We had no customer information on over 70% of calls, which all would result in longer call times and automatic failed grades, and again people were terminated due to it. I would complain about the no information calls and about the software crashes, and the constant pushing and pushing which I knew would result in the longer call times and I was told that ""It was always something with me"" but nothing was done to correct the problems and I would see fewer and fewer people on the floor. After a while, the emotional duress of all these factors takes its tolls on employees, and I have seen over 100 people leave just this account, which is over 100% turnover. I always wanted to do my job to the best of my ability. I gave over 110%.
Extremely high turnover rate. Majority of the people that they hired were extremely unprofessional and trashy. They have no sense of respect or manners. Coworkers would sexually, and otherwise, harass me and management took no effort to address the issue. Long hours of sitting, with short breaks that do not even give you a change to get your food, let alone eat it. The environment and the people are not of high quality and standards. Any decent person would feel miserable and out of place working inside this company. I stayed there through training and then I left due to the environment, coworkers and their highly unprofessional behavior, and the exhausting nature of the hours of my shift.
Everything is your fault including their own systems being down and convergys own system being down will cause your pay to be docked along with marks on your record with them, no matter how many other people share the same issue its always your equipment, they will cheat you on pay, both convergys and the payroll company refuse to provide pay slips. If your thinking of this to make some extra money do not do it unless your comfortable with scamming customers and practicing unethical business practices, such as refusing disabled veterans services they paid for, out right lying to customers, stating reasons you cant do your job because of state and federal laws that do not cover said issue, etc. The list of unethical practices from this company go on and on they are not a stepping stone, they do not retain employees any length of time and they will not pay you at the hired rate of pay, they will scam you on hours and overtime pay as well.
This place is all about cons. The higher ups are in a buddy buddy relationship and everyone else is only a target. If one decides they do not like you, they all do not like you. The newest operations manager at our site will not even address people he does not like. It is rude and very unprofessional to those that are trying to meet and hope to move up. High retention due to the lack of respect and reward to those that try to work. You get little say in your schedule and your Team Leader if you get a good one will put up a fight for you though in the end they will lose and so will you. The company also penalizes you for the smallest things, myself with a disability get attendance violations because they use an offsite company for dealing with medical leave needs. If you take an extra few moments for a break punished. All while upper management constantly take extra breaks or walk around the building chatting. It sets a very unfair balance between the workers and the management team.
There is a constant bait and switch going on with this company. I was hired as a tech support rep and then required to learn sales and billing. They treat their people as an expendable resource. Their performance metrics are sometimes in direct opposition of each other - if you achieve one it makes another impossible. Performance incentives are a joke almost no one can figure out what you are getting that extra 10 cents for at any time. Their ""coaching"" templates require negative and positive feedback every time. So basically no matter how well you do you will always be exposed to someone digging to find something negative to comment on which is unhealthy. They don't give raises - ever. They require acknowledgement of coaching, training, disciplinary actions etc. and intentionally do not allow enough time to read what you are acknowledging. Additionally you have no recourse if you don't believe what you are acknowledging is accurate. Bottom line is this - Convergys doesn't care about doing the right thing it cares only about giving the appearance of propriety.
The benefits and the barely livable wage weren't enough to save this stinker. I can't stress the attendance policy posts from everyone else enough. I was given an ultimatum to keep my job because I went on a scheduled vacation that apparently wasn't really approved of despite the fact that it said it was. I was diagnosed and struggled with major depression while I worked there and every day that I felt like killing myself and couldn't bare to drag myself into this place, I got a mark up from management. My direct supervisor did as much as she could, thankfully, keeping me employed for a margin of time further. But if my attendance wasn't in such disrepair from my ILLNESS, I wouldn't have been fired for taking a SCHEDULED VACATION.
On the flip side of having the opportunity to make money, just about every bit of it is required overtime. You don't have a choice in the matter. You either sign up for a minimum of 7 hours or they will hammer you with overtime for the week which includes reducing your hour lunch to 30 minutes. I signed up for overtime one week. 7 hrs. They approved 5 THEN added 6.5 mandatory hrs on top of that. This is not conducive for a person who has a family. They will not work with your schedule either. People who have kids in daycare, transportation situations i.e. bus, or anything else, they will not work with you. The environment is like a high school locker room. Young, loud crowd with very foul language almost all of the time. Very unprofessional atmosphere. And the includes the way most people dress. I don't feel like there is much opportunity unless you fit in with the ""crowd"" here. I was promised a pay raise after my 90 days and still haven't received it 2 months later.
Constantly changing metrics, impossible to meet. You are criticized for everything you do. Horrible pay. $9.00 an hour, and they don't even give you 40 hours a week. NOT enough to live off of. Horrible managers. I had one good manager for about a month, then a steady stream of worse and worse managers. Got yelled at for phone calls too long, got yelled at for not using EXACT phrase to answer/end call. It was demeaning I stuck it out for almost a year, got a total of $.50 cent raise over that time frame. It's a revolving door of hires. Of the 25 people in my class, only three (3) lasted to the end of the class and got on the floor. After 3 months, I was the only one of the class still there. They pay you like a 3rd world worker, and treat you about the same. Tech support is all indian, you can't understand them, and they always blame you. Like a boat owner, the 2 happiest days at covergys are the day you are hired, and the day you finally quit.
Pay is $4 to $6 dollars an hour lower than the prevailing call center wage in this area. Team leads are punished when they try to help their people and rewarded when they can cheat you out of money. During my interview I specifically asked if we had to sell as I did not want a sales job. I was told no problem you don't have to sell anything. After training we were given the metric for bonuses, yes there was a minimum sales number to make for bonus. This was just the first lie. I was told by the site manager that if we did not like aspects of our job, ""You know where the door is, there are plenty more people out there who want your job."" This attitude rolls down hill from corporate.
Basically treated as a robot equivalent. There to make the company money, not for any personal reward whatsoever (you would have to some sort of mental defect to take pride in your work, or feel as though your presence there is appreciated by anybody). You can seriously work there for several months and have virtually no idea who your direct supervisor actually is. Since their experience/education requirements aren't the highest, you'll be surrounded by a lot of less than desirables. The aroma of stagnant cigarette smoke, BO, microwaved food permeates the air . The temperature in the building is kept at 80-85 year round with humidity low enough to rival that of death valley. It is almost really like working in hell. There's no where to go to use a computer/phone for personal use on break/lunch, even though theres 500+ computers/phones in the building. . I know this is pretty much like every place, but CVG seems to be an exception....if your willing to put up with the shite and allow yourself to become one of the herd, it isn't all that bad. Proves there is a price tag one can put on one's sanity.
I worked there for a year, and in that time, only three weeks did I have a supervisor. There are about 10 employees under each supervisor, and that is who we were supposed to contact when requesting excused time-off. The head supervisors overlooked our team, not appointing someone directly over us to deal with our issues, as they were unwilling to take on that role -- for their job was being the supervisor to the supervisors and not to the customer service reps. Did not receive a raise, because we were without a supervisor. And when requesting excused time-off, while experiencing difficulty getting it approved by the head supervisors, someone finally signed-off, gave me the go-ahead to take my time, and when my evaluation came up after receiving direct supervision, my absences were in the system as unexcused and the paperwork from the person who signed-off on it disappeared. Also, there was very high-turnover with not only the customer service reps, but also the supervision team. They were very disorganized and undedicated to their duties.
Clarksville TN: revolving door, they do not appreciate employees, trashy work environment, employees all sleeping with each other, one week new class will arrive the next week 5 people get walked out. 700+ seats as advertised, ONLY 200+ filled... Why is this? Forced to call out if PTO/UTO not available, SICK...? That could cost you your Job! Points system for which you get if tardy or leave early or call out is the HORRIBLE! Put it this way, if you are tardy one minute (keep in mind you have 5 min to logon your systems) you get 1/4 or .25 a point when a whole day off is one point. You work 3/4 of day and get sick, too bad .50 or 1/2 point GONE and you only get 12 points! I am still employed here, take my advice stay away.
The training just wasn't enough to prepare most of us. In fact the only people who got through it were people that worked with them before. There were about 20 people when I started the training and by the time the end of week 2 came there were maybe 11 left. Getting your greeting together and speaking with customers wasn't hard but learning the systems in such a small amount of time just wasn't working. You get about 2 and a half weeks before you do blended training where you answer calls for 4 hours. The first week alone is dedicated to just downloading software, getting your login info. So a week is dedicated to just figuring out the login systems and HR and pay info etc. Meanwhile you have about a week and a half to figuring out maybe 5 or 6 other large systems with a lot of info. The software they had me download gave my laptop a nasty virus they had no idea how to deal with.
Upper management is a joke. They do not promote or retain management based on performance or skill - it's very difficult to tell why certain people keep their jobs for as long as they do. Corporate doesn't explain why decisions are made even when it directly affects an entire city of employees - and if you read more reviews you will find that getting laid off happens all the time. They have little concern for professionalism and more concern for warm bodies to take calls. If the companies that contract with Convergys actually know how they operate, then shame on them too. If you're looking for a job and not a career, go for it, it's a paycheck, quite possible temporary. If you're looking for honesty, professionalism, a company that cares at all about their employees, run and run fast. They're classic slime bag corporate America with nonexistent morals.
If you have over 5 attendance points, you won't get promoted to anything, regardless of what you're told. A lot of favoritism goes on between operations managers, team leads, and agents, which is why a lot of people who deserve promotions will not get them, regardless of how hard they work.
One common thing I've heard from management here is ""You care too much"", and this is in a job that is supposedly customer service. So many metrics used to measure employee performance, it is literally impossible for anyone to meet them all. As a result, there will always be something that management can hold over your head, and they will to the point of harassment. Also, every single thing you do is documented, so good luck filing for unemployment when they inevitably fire you at some point in your tenure. They will have stacks of documentation to provide to the unemployment office, and their highest paid employee at each call-center is their HR Manager whose job it is to make a strong relationship with the department of unemployment and minimize the number of people who they have to pay unemployment to.
- Painfully slow growth. It can take many years to get a promotion depending on the project. They also have a tendency to bring higher ups from other projects that have no knowledge of the project they are now on than promote employees that have been working on that project for years. There are also positions where there is an increase of work, but no increase of pay. - Computer systems are horrible. The majority of the time the different systems do not cooperate with each other, and there are times when they cannot be accessed at all. - Senior management changes often, so it is hard to get to know them. This is also the same for employees, which rotate out constantly. - Dirty work conditions. Stained carpets, facilities doesn't clean up spills on floors for a week, broken locks in bathrooms
They make it impossible to get a raise or move up the ladder. There is still stress,but it is because of Corporate sitting on their butts letting people below them do whatever the heck they want to. There is way too much lack of communication between departments
Low pay scale. If you require accommodations, GOOD LUCK! Unstable job security. Inconsistent use of policies. Use misleading terms such as being rewarded for OT with earning points back, they do not allow you to earn points back they give you the ones you would get back 1 year after the point went on your record, early.
There is not much I can say about this company that is positive. Their turnover rate is astronomical, seniority means nothing when bidding for schedules, and I got the impression upper management sees their employees as little more than cheap and easily replaced labor. The worst is they don't even give raises anymore, not even a cost of living raise. I worked on the ATT U-Verse program and they had us on a pay for performance program. However, they kept raising the metrics making it very difficult to get the highest possible bonus (which was only $1.50 per hour). They increased the amount of sales were suppose to make in order to meet that metric, so apparently management is unaware that when the economy is in the toilet like it is now fewer customers are going to be able to buy cell phones and expensive TV and internet plans.
Expectation setting and follow through is non-existent. If you put yourself out there as someone who works harder than their peers, you now have the target on your chest. Compensation for work is disgraceful. No raises for three years yet constantly being asked to work harder. Revolving door of agents. When pressed by management why success is not happening it is not right to say that everyone who could have done this right has already been here and been terminated. Communication is a problem. Managers bring up widespread changes and within a week they are forgotten about. Unless it can be used as a way to terminate someone. Spoke to an outside hiring manager in the area. When I told her where I was employed she replied that they cannot hire people who work at Convergys because of the negative outcomes from the past. Their reputation in the local area is horrible, and other HR people know that. No one in Arnold is up for the task of changing that, and there are a lot of good people still there.
Some legacy systems could be updated
- Recruiters suck you in with the pay of 9.00/hr for fulltime work. What they don't tell you is that you will never get a raise. You are stuck at that amount for however long you choose to stay in that position. Of course they make it seem like you can earn a whole lot from sales which you can - what they don't tell you is that you have to make a certain quota to even be eligible for the payout and don't get excited you won't even see that till 4-6 months after you first start working there. Some days there are too many people and if not enough volunteer to go home guess what - by choice you are sent home and docked some hours. The managers there are too buddy buddy and you can tell which ones to stay away from. For the amount of work they ask you to do you might as well sell your soul to them and their ""client"". Expect to get cursed out, threatened to die, harm against your family and unborn children, get a fatal disease, about every other day.
Low pay in comparison to same job with Dell. (Outsourced) Higher management, above Team Leads, are more concerned with numbers, then the client. Higher management seems to implement policy that makes it far harder for the agents to do the job. Benefits are not that great. Not all are treated fairly, If your in good with management you can do no wrong, and get a TON of chances, where as everyone else as to be completely by the book. Same with promotions, they tout they promote from within, which they do, but its all about who you know and not what you know, some of the best techs at this site get turned down for promotions because of one thing or another, but someone far less qualified who has far more strikes against them get the job. Use it for what it is, a stepping stone to say you have worked for Dell, and to get the tech and call center XP then move on. This place is just a way to pad your resume.
Most jobs are entry-level and pay poorly for very demanding and mentally stressful work. I only made $9.50 when I started, although they do pay around $11.00 now at the site I worked at, that is still not much. The work was also way too sales focused, as the company just went along with the client's demand for CSRs to also be sales support, which is a really bad idea when customers call in just to get a problem fixed and are not looking to buy anything and increase their bill. Forcing employees to make ""offers"" is counterintuitive and and no part of the employee's pay should be based off of sales in a customer service job, regardless of which company is the client. Employee giveaways and prizes were also not executed well, as they were pretty much just luck-based and your chances of winning something are slim. Benefits in general were not great.
There was pressure to make all of your goals when it came to customer satisfaction. Pretty much everything we said to the customers over the phone was scripted. No chance for raises based on performance or the economy. Customers calling in were horrendous! The Convergys I worked at dealt with AT&T U-Verse. Even after two weeks of training and two weeks of taking phone calls with coaches, you never feel prepared enough to step out on your own. Never sat in the same ""cubicle"" twice, thus germs thrived. Hard to work with schedule as you have to ""bid"" on what kind of schedule you want, and in order to get what hours you want, you need to be a high ranking employee. When I had a question for our ""Team Leader"", he was NEVER AVAILABLE.
Poor management. Awful training of two and one-half weeks, followed by a week of useless guessing games. Learned nothing of how to do the job. Had a 'coach' switch my phone to 'coaching; while I was on a call. Told to send the call to a supervisor, put my phone on mute saying no one needs to hear our talk. As I transferred the call, I began the intro between the caller and the supv, but all got to say was 'this' and the caller took over. This lousy, hateful excuse of a coach bawled me out for not introducing the two and when I told her I didn't get a chance, she called me a liar and told me she heard the conversation. She continued to call me a liar and told me I needed to admit to it. I told her I wouldn't admit to it because I did make the effort. All it took to get me out of there.
Management only cares about productivity, which is what makes the company money. Too quick to fire people without all the facts. A lot of broken promises from management and they trick you into overtime with incentives. You do overtime expecting to get it on the next check for that pay period, instead they break it up and sometimes you never see it. Over the last year the quality of the company has dwindled, they use to actually work with you when it came to school, children, etc but now they don't and claim its based on the needs of the business when yet we clearly see and know differently, A lot of favoritism,
Its a corporation that is very low paying. Went 10 years without a raise. Instead they gave performance incentive bonuses. In 2000 I was making $13.83. My manager told me that I have reached the salary cap and will not have any more Wage increases. Thought this will be temporary and I had too many years with the company for benefit purposes to leave. Many of us were in the same boat. In 2009 I posted out for a Workforce Mgr Associate position. Did not like the position but the salary increased to $31,000. In July 2010 was laid off . Job relocated to Convergys in India. Thought about returning to Convergys Corp. but the starting salary for Customer Service Rep is between $9.00 - $10.00 regardless of your past experience. The pension I had stayed with the company for was not worth it. The monthly pension amount is $200.00 a month after 20yrs of service. The up side had 4 weeks of PTO time. Which you need in a call center environment - you get burnt out. Currently unemployed
-High turn-over rates -New hires have two weeks on the floor in sales department before quickly being moved to CRG (retention department) whether they have a choice in the matter. -The management is not great. -Some team leaders on the floor are unreliable as team leaders (never available, etc) -Sitting all day in cubicle -Too many staff to find a free computer before being late trying to get logged into one -High stress level job at times

You can get lost in the crowd if you don't make yourself be heard. Bad training. They will fire employees to make sure their managers metrics met goal, instead of working with an employee. The biggest issue is getting paid anything more than your paycheck. I had to fight for 6 months to get refferal bonus due in 90 days, and am still fighting to get bonus money promised for monthly performance almost 4 months ago. CONVERGYS DOES NOT PAY AS PROMISED WHEN IT COMES TO INCENTIVES.
As with most call centers, you are part of a machine geared toward satisfying the parameters and goals of the client contract. These can change from month to month and depending on how much top-down pressure middle management gets from the client, you’ll find yourself shifting gears. Training was less than impressive on certain contracts. It seems that customer tracking rather product knowledge is the primary focus. Also, they have no loyalty towards their employees regardless of past high performance marks. Very little flexibility – Miss to many days, you’re gone. Acquire to negative review points, you’re gone. Unable to play the middle management political game, you’re gone. You get the picture. They have no interest in utilizing a person’s area of expertise or background to enhance the internal operation. They just want bodies in seats.
Wish I made more. The project I work on is VERY diffficult and I don't feel the pay scale fits the difficulty.
Convergys provided 60 day notice to advised they were shutting down their brick and mortar centers in 3 locations in Utah. I believe they could have done more to keep projects moving forward in these locations. Keeping competition healthy in the community. Instead they gave up in the 3 locations. Sad as many good people were forced to move to other companies when they enjoyed working for Convergys.

Feel that our trainer lacked knowledge and is not able to answer our questions. The training dept is always telling us how we will not pass if we don't meet certain things. But I don't feel they fully prepare us and it makes me fear for my job. Lots of gossip you over hearr amongst the training dept. A little more professionlism would be nice.

The atmosphere is very ""cliquey"". There are some hostile people in the training class, which can make things very stressful. Management is lax about letting people sleep in class, text, swear and be generally inappropriate.
Strict attendance during training (which for me has been the first five weeks of employment), some trainers/floor support are off-putting and might discourage some from seeking support, not a viable long-term position unless you plan on being promoted, strong possibility of odd and inconsistent hours (due to typical call center expectations), strong possibility of overtime, required to work most holidays
Some downsides to working at Convergys would be that there is no normal or stable work environment. Once you get used to being on a certain teams that you actually work well with, the team changes without warning. You never get to pick teams or stay on a team that has worked well together to maximize sales.

Initial Interview requires an assessment test which includes a typing test, arithmetic test, vocabulary test, customer service evaluations (how would you respond to customers regarding the information they are requesting), and then 2 face to face interviews; and of course if you are unable to pass the assessments the first time you have I believe 6 months to retry passing the assessment tests.

Micromangement!!! It is really annoying. You meet with your team leader 1-2 times per week for a ""coaching session"" and they are obsessed with your stats. Some team leaders talk to you daily about your performance. If you want to work in sales and billing for AT and T, you had better like to do sales. They expect you to make an offer on every call. People are calling in with billing questions and you need to try to sell them something. It's not like working as a car salesperson or jewelry salesperson where the customers enter your store because they are at least somewhat interested in buying something. You have to bug everyone who calls in about a billing question. That's what the job is. You can't pick and choose who you try to sell to, you HAVE to ask the customers some questions about their TV, internet, phone, and even cell phone usage and preferences to gather information to offer them something.
There is definite sexism in the workplace from the all-female upper administration. If you're not female, there is a strong chance you're not moving up the corporate ladder to even low level supervisory roles. Also, they are continuing to find ways to reduce benefits and pay at every step, with most recent being cutting holiday pay hours. The health benefit packages are more expensive and less coverage than private plans obtained for an individual outside the company, you'll save yourself money to get your own health, dental, and vision coverage elsewhere. If you ever intend on a raise, go elsewhere. The pay is set, and you'll NEVER see a pay raise after the 6mo 'you haven't quit yet' raise.
The nature of the work could cause programs to end, while you're still attached. You have to be flexible and willing to make lateral career moves, as well as going above and behind to be recognized. While the technology support team is well suppored, unlike the operations team, promotions can be slow. However, the technology team is also not exposed to the constant change within the call center business.

","Low pay and smaller bonuses
None really, left for a higher paying job offer
Seem to be laying off long term employees
Systems are dated and often manual. They are in the process of being updated, but working through them can be a challenge.
In office requirements, lower pay for high risk jobs
Chicago has most of the most senior roles... hard to work elsewhere if you want to be in senior leadership.
Work life balance, overcommitment of projects by management
PTO does not roll over. Must use by EOY.
Either add more resources or re-prioritize.
Traditional setup. Want you in office, cameras on, nice clothes. As a developer you get slight slack but don’t expect as comfy as a tech office would be.
Not great pay Teams don’t communicate internally great all the time
Less flexibility in terms of work/life balance than similar organizations.
None! Company is always looking for feedback on way to improve!
none at this time to report
Nothing negative to say about working there
Could pay better, not enough networking events
Seem to be laying off long term employees
Salary is a little lower than some other companys in the same space.
Their pay was not as good as the company that offered me more income.
Can be High turnover at times

Terrible management and little to no training. Manager was new and knew little to nothing about the systems. Overall horrible experience. Was sourced and headhunted to join Northen Trust and learned after being hired we has been hired DURING a reorg in the department. After 7 mos, was laid off. Now I’ve been unemployed for 5mos and can’t get an interview with any other companies. Devastating

Pay is less than market standards
Really have no cons as far as the company/work environment.
Some antiquated technology systems and processes
Wages are lower compared to other companies in this sector
Does not pay too well. lots of turnover
Nobody wanted to make decisions. There were lots of ideas, but decisions did not get made.
Very conservative bank and may be falling behind with competitive salaries.
Tech is terrible. Constant patches. Managers are given too much independence, if they go astray you're on your own.
Using India in lieu of hiring more workers
Currently managing expenses by cutting workforce.

Short staff in work place
I felt the salary was lower than it should have been for the position
Current Promotion Freeze due to economics in the industry
Work/Life balance is not great as it wouldn't be in any other 9 - 5 job. Nothing against Northern Trust.
Northern Trust is a great brand company and has their own online study resources which is awesome!
One of less than 1% of companies that survive over 100 years, so some technology and advancements are behind the curve (this is also a positive since there is so much opportunity to create positive impact in your role)
Dated software systems are slow
Wish the pay was a bit better.
Low salaries compared to the markets
Nothing in particular experienced so far.
In the hybrid schedule we only come once a week
Bureaucracy and red tape sometimes means longer wait to get things done, but it’s understandable since they are custodians off a lot of money
Bonuses aren’t great, promotions aren’t necessarily big steps up- there’s more “levels” almost as filler so you feel like you’re moving up (and getting a raise) but it’s very small increments
Pay was not as competitive as competitors

People are a little lazy
Lots of egos. People will treat you as an inferior. Not open to your input. People are very two-faced. Expect you to be an expert without helping you. Salaries not great.
The pay is not the best.
Previous managers gave little to no support. I was left to train myself as most managers that initially hired me were let go or moved on.
Multiple overlapping and redundant workflows and processes
No cons as of yet
Have to be in the office
Economic conditions for them to lay employees off.
Slow to adapt to change
Old school in operation. Pay increases rarely happen
Low tech in use, low pay
sometimes it can be a little too consensus driven

No diversity or representation of African Americans. The work is very mundane and repetitive.

pay needs to be higher
Managing change Return to office
sometimes it can be a little too consensus driven
Will come across some people that are difficult to work with but that’s the case at every firm
Advancement can be very slow
Lower average salary than industry-wise
slow and entrenched relationships to navigate. you never know if you stepped on a landmine when people.
I have no cons at this time.
Difficult to understand what future could be in terms of advancing career. Extremely difficult to negotiate raises
A little need of updating for offices.
The pay is not competitive with minimal mobility

Jobs moving to India Cost cutting
The money is okayish for being out of college
1. Low compensation. You will be paid well below the market. You will be gaslit every year that you should just be grateful to have a job. Your salary will not keep up with inflation or the market. You will not be able to re-negotiate. 2. Low or no bonuses. Most likely, you will not be paid your bonus in full. At times you will not be paid a bonus at all. You will be gaslit that you should be grateful to just have a job. 3. Little or no remote work. You will be asked to work in the office even when your job can be performed remotely, and you will be closely monitored. Managers don't know how to manage remote teams. The leadership is even more out of touch with work in the 21st century. The goal is to force everyone back into the office. They force everyone to go in at least two-three days a week, which is awful, and they are moving to enforce four and five days. 4. Unreasonable expectations. Because people are routinely fired and laid off, and because people are routinely leaving the company given the terrible work conditions, you will be asked to perform two-three jobs for one salary. This is the norm, not the exception. 5. No job security. You will come to work every day unsure if it is your last day. That is because people are routinely fired, laid off, or forced to retire - always with no warning. This happens because the leadership is mismanaging spending, and after they overspend, they fire partners so they can still be profitable. 6. A company for older people only. You will be given old technology or new technology with all the new features disabled for security reasons. You will work for old leaders, who are against remote work and flexible work, and who manage the way they learned to manage in the last century. 7. Manufacturing-like culture. You will be treated like a worker in a manufacturing environment. You will be asked to work in the office, and your work output will be monitored minute by minute. Even if you are an exempt employee, you will be asked to fill out several time sheets, detailing all the tasks you perform and for how long you perform them. 8. Abusive leaders. Depending where you end up, you may work for an abusive leader, or a leader with unmanaged mental illness. You will be abused verbally and emotionally. When that happens, you will have nowhere to go, because HR supports only the leadership. You will have to leave the company, while the abusive leader will remain in place. 9. Unsafe working conditions. You will work for leaders who either don't believe COVID is real, or believe that COVID is not harmful to your health. You will work in an environment where no vaccines are required, and no masks are required. You will have to work next to people who routinely show up to work sick.
I have no cons at this time.
Mandatory office time. Must be in office 2 times a week
very very very boring boring

i work nights so. it was calm
Being in the field of technology, this place brings a major challenge--in a positive and negative way. The positive being that there's no other enterprise environment regarding networking around the area and that hands-on experience is invaluable. Past that, the health benefits are ok (very high deductibles). The PTO is definitely one of the highlights of the compensation package (3 weeks at the start of every year). But be careful when it comes to choosing roles or else you may never get to truly enjoy your PTO. They will pay 100% to get an Associates degree if you don't have that already and will also reimburse some money back for getting a Bachelor's as long as you commit to working 2 years are obtaining the degree.
Love the small team environment ! Everyone is personable and willing to help out however they can.
Company truck, 401K match, Ability to make your own schedule

It was a good place when Germans was there learn a lot. Plus it wasn't no favoritism are racism
Disclaimer: Pros only existent if this is a job for you NOT a career Reliable co-workers Remote-hybrid due to pandemic Low stress
Co-workers had great attitudes, facilties were clean and overall comfortable work environment
I love the people there. You had to put in your dues before becoming a machine Operator, but nothing that you wouldn't find anywhere else and to be expected. You had to be a packer for the requisite three months if you weren't a direct hire, but par for the course. I found the people, culture, and company as a whole to be encouraging, supportive, and laid back. The work was not generally physically demanding. They let you have a speaker to listen to music and you could have drinks at your station. Everyone there went above and beyond to make me feel part of the gang. Even though it's been a few months since I was there I still miss everybody :( The schedule was fifteen 12-hour days on and fifteen days off which I will list as both a pro and a con as every 2-3 days you swung from days to nights, but you only worked two weekends a month (one on days and one on nights) and the nature of this schedule tended to give you longer than average time off for the holidays. Oh, I almost forgot- they like to do special things for their employees once a month, like they will get some kind of food truck. One month it might be tenderloins and burgers and the next it could be ice cream. Sometimes, they would take all our orders for a local eatery or they would treat us to pizza. The long haulers would grumble about management or certain policies that maybe I didn't have insight into not having worked there for very long, but on the whole it seemed that management and the company was very caring for their employees.
A great work environment is void of micro-managing. The TMOD division allows employees to continue to grow and develop professionally and personally through hundreds of educational and developmental training courses.
Work Life Balance, multi cultural experience
Company culture is good in there.

Good people to work with
Great benefits. Highly competitive wages.
Lower management seems to care about workers, benefits are normal and working conditions are good.
Good Pay and opportunity for growth
The skills & expertise of the employees is top-notch & the benefits are some of the best you will find in the auto industry.
","1. Need to improve more benefits on insurance coverage .
managment does not have your back. and lead man will tell own you
This company operates on a lot of old-school politics and elitist ideas unfortunately, so getting though that can be quite a challenge. Promotions and role changes are heavily influenced by who you know and how you present yourself (male or female) rather than being performance based. There are a lot of people in leadership that are just there because they've always been there or simply because a higher-up is buddies with them and have no actual business being in leadership.
Sometimes not a clear direction or strategy. Very flexible which can be good, but can sometimes create roadblocks and setbacks.
Minimal merit increases, no opportunity for advancement, constant supply chain issues
This plant is shutting down, so the staff is being downsized.
Need to continue to focus on manufacturing and design moving the business forward.
12 hour shift to long.
Easy to get thrown into the mass of workers, hard to stick out for promotions.
Salary low Regular work Little micro management
Health insurance is poor. Could improve on all aspects of the health benefits
no cons that i can think of besides going to the office
work can be hard sometimes
Great stepping stone and opportunity for someone looking to gain experience
Bad management, work a lot, low pay, no ac in some parts, favoritism
Suffers from big company beaurcracy, upward mobility is also slow. Pay increases likewise tend to come slowly.
Salary lower than the competitors
Management, requirements, HR, drive time, no advancement.
Shift rotation was difficult to manage
Tendency to relocate white collar work to low cost countries reduces career path for those in high cost countries. Burdensome business processes make it difficult to get things done.
Hard to grow in your area, need to move groups in order to grow in the company.
I don't have any at this time.
Found out about plant closing from local news crew who showed up and asked employees how they felt about closing. Moved 800 jobs to MX.
Interaction between diferente areas can be better
Growth limitation, decisions made in different locations.
Pay is below average. Benefits not good enough
Pay and progression, can be difficult
As one of the largest Tier One automotive suppliers in the world, it can be hard to be ""SEEN"" with so many people, divisions, and salary grades in the organization
Too much downtime during a shift sometimes
- Everyone pretends to be busy all the time and wears their overbooked calendar as a badge of honor. In reality, 98% of these meetings are useless and these people just want to feel important. - The company and policies actively act against the employees trying to get work done. I've never seen so much red tape. It became exhausting and wasn't even worth it to try to complete a project because of the amount of unnecessary approvals and hoops to jump through. - The hybrid work policy is solely for micromanagement and appearance purposes. They are building a new building and getting a tax break, therefore need people to come into the office to fill it. However, they are trying to say they want to maintain the nonexistent ""culture"" by bringing people back into the office. - There is absolutely no innovation and creativity is not celebrated. - Managers have favorites and do little to disguise that. - They love to say that the Truck Tire side of the business is a ""family"" which is just code for a toxic environment. - The offices are just depressing. It feels like the life is leaving your body when you walk inside.
Onboarding is time consuming and hard to get access to internal systems.
Training needs some work but the team is working on it
There are no cons to working here.
Lack of communication, and very low morale
Swing Schedule 12 hour shift
Bosses are not recommended and arrogant
Seems to always be a step behind, reactive
- bad organizations - hard to increase the salary after a while
The opportunities for advancing were a bit limited. possibly due to so many long term employees.
Some decisions are concentrated on the upper management in Europe
Product line and road map for new technology and future direction needs to be solidified.
Not very competitive salary wise
Slow growth and career path development
Benefits could be better and all internal portals can be improved.
Sometimes there are issues with people who are terrible at their job but are not help accountable. There are times where there is no work so you get sent home. Schedule is not always followed. Sometimes management does not seem to listen. Sometimes I felt that the pay was too low for certain jobs.
Very fast paced, not conducive to learning

Sometimes management doesn’t know what they’re saying
(Tires) Tow cons mainly. Firstly, not a high performance organization. If you are the driven type, the work is not the most challenging. Consequently technical expertise either does not seem to be needed nor valued. This is perhaps the flip side of being such a comfortable place to work. Secondly, promotion criteria can seem a little obscure at times and bureaucratic requirements (e.g grades) can get in the way.
Good team work together and interesting technology
Very fast paced, not conducive to learning

Really bad racists people, favoritism, overwork by only some Supervisors, and want promote blacks ups in roles that they apply and are qualified for and HR/ management is unfair.
Cons applicable if position is a career: Unable to advance within department - all management positions are locked only way to advance within company is to transfer departments Request/expected though not required to use unique skillset without compensation for said skillset Company interest is valued above employee needs ie: Pay was garnished for most Continental employees, everyone within this department, during pandemic until reinstated in Q4 of 2020 despite company being the most profitable during pandemic Contributions that may improve department as whole are awarded ""thanks"", no form of compensation is awarded for improvements that of any magnitude Cons applicable if position is a job: 12 hour shifts with weekly alternating schedule as of this posting Week 1: OFF - Sunday/Wednesday/Thursday Week 2: OFF - Monday/Tuesday Friday/Saturday Repeat Annual training modules on same material with MINIMAL updates: Three sets of training modules two of which consist of 20-50 hours of course material. No pay differential for individuals in night shift or for unique skillset
Long shifts, twelve hours of standing
The Operator job looks deceptively simple, but had somewhat of a learning curve which was frustrating to me personally because everyone made it look so easy, but no one ever gave me guff about it. In fact, everyone there was rooting for me more than I was. I had more than a 30 minute commute both ways and going from days to nights and back again every few days made the 12-hour shifts interminable. The nature of the work was fairly repetitive (I know that this is probably true of most factories, but not all) and just made it too long of a day for me. Although, I understand they have a couple other areas of the plant with a more standard schedule; Added Value which paid a bit less and I forgot the name of the area in back, but I believe the pay there was equivalent.
None that I can think of.
Old mentality, bad leadership, others
Less payment according to other companies in the industry.
Automotive is a fast paced industry
location, canteen, overtime, noisy operation
In order to reach the objective of the job, a long hours and stressful work is necessary. (long hours = 50-60hrs)
Really bad racists people, favoritism, overwork by only some Supervisors, and want promote blacks ups in roles that they apply and are qualified for and HR/ management is unfair.
Some processes are not well defined
Product portfolio is radar heavy and needs diversification Compensation is below market
Not applicable to my position
A growing shift from high cost countries to others.
Pay is not as good as industry lead.
Weekend shifts and mandates on days off
I am assuming most of the auto industry is this way, but the amount of pressure to potentially impress the client is pretty high.
production environment, need to go to production line
If you don't want ot you you still get it
Increases take longer than expected.
Very Lean. Depending on which division you are in there cold be less flexibility.
No cons really to mention
Sometimes processes and bureaucracy can be excessive
Lack of management and training
Poor management and below average pay
high rate hours of works
Work/life balance in some business areas and functions is not as balanced as in others.
Salaries did not grow during pandemic inflation.
Not very flexible on what shift your required to work, it takes a long time to build enough seniority to get dayshift (if that’s what you prefer), until then you will work every weekend.
No, cons to speak of
Work life balance and move to Mexico
Not enough diversity and inclusion.
The management does not care about anything but numbers.
Compensation needs to improve for the area.
Very big company, can get forgotten in eyes of management
Toxic employees and no levels of support
Lots of time behind wheel. Mobile office is second home. Visiting dealers, fleets, and prospecting. CRM system sucks. Outdated and inefficient systems, flows, and processes. European executive team out of touch with American market.
High turnover rate, poor management, change schedule at last minute, HR is shady
Management in Germany does not know how a plant operates. Moving a plant which is set to A different location is actually a dumb move. But I guess that’s why they are into management not engineering. Anyways I feel bad for the people still there.
Contract is in a place for you
Can be up an down work load
The current management does not care about family. They exclude maintenance from their “One team” slogan. They use maintenance as a catchall for the blame of every mistake but they hold production on a pedestal
Not any room for advancement or cross training on any other areas.
Long 12 hour shift, heavy equipment
The focus tends to always be on ""putting out the largest fire"" while allowing other fires to spread

Interesting work, high tech projects, good hard working peers, love my team.
Great ability to change your work priorities midstream as it is a daily occurrence. If you enjoy chaos, mismanagement, tight purse strings, relentless meetings, spending time figuring out how to do your work, and spending more time self-teaching than working, this is the place for you.
The people I work with are great and smart people.
Simple work, opportunity for overtime, flexible hours.
Good pay and benefits, working conditions are decent overall, sharp co-workers, products well-received by customers.
Great benefits. Lots of opportunities for growth and move up. They're very flexible to meet our needs and arrange accommodations. There's definitely future in this company. They pretend they care for us, some supervisors actually care for us, some don't care at all.
Lots of good experience in an EHS role. Good balance of environmental and safety responsibilities.
Amazing company and great benefits. I started here as an intern and moved to full time after college and I can't see myself working anywhere else. Most if not all teams/programs strive to better everyones careers, and it's just always been a great place to work.
The pay can be good hourly if you live there and work a minimum of 60 hours a week.
Great opportunities if you stay with it
- Good work environment and colleagues - Decent benefits
Flexible work schedule, Pay is good for time. Work Hybrid.
I've really enjoyed my 5 years at Collins Aerospace. Spent the last 5 years in Custodial work and just transferred to their Soldering department. It's been a cool experience. Great management and amazing coworkers. It helps that the job is relatively easy to pick up and everyone is super helpful when you don't know something.
Good pay and bonus Interesting work and products Good people to work with
Very understanding of work and life balance
-Collins has a good working culture, with supportive low level management. -I find my work to be personally interesting and varied.
Great benefits, good experience overall. Learned a lot technically
The time off is literally the only pro.

I enjoyed my time at this company for several reasons. The people are top-notch – friendly, hardworking, and dedicated. The work is anything but boring, and you get plenty of chances to step up and make a difference.
Career Growth Opportunity and Pay

Pay and benefits are very good for the area You'll get to work with some very talented people Work schedule is usually flexible depending on position There doesn't seem to be any shortage of work for the foreseeable future (short to mid-term job security)
Benefits package and 3 weeks of pto availability
Spent a week filling out the onboarding. Nobody in there company knew what the other recruiter was doing so HR came up with an excuse so they didn't have to do there job on a Monday morning. I would have loved to work for this company however there choice in there recruiter company needs to change. If the company wants to hire me that's great, but I won't ever work for a staffing company that takes two weeks to get a job at a low low ball offer. Great interview process with the company not with there staffing agency.
Interesting work - continuous stream of new work/projects.
- Great culture - Good Work
Upward Mobility Growth Opportunities Good Team Culture
Great benifits. Sick pay and time off for vacation.
Stability, strong leadership teams, good compensation and benefits
The team was fantastic. The 401k was ok.
Pay is good for the area.
Lots of challenging projects to engage in and opportunities to pursue.
Ability to work remotely, managers appear flexible with schedules, company-provided desk setup, and fair benefits package
Large company with plenty of positions, majority of roles are engineering and operations. Solid avionics business with existing customer base.
Decent flexible hours for those that want to work any shift.
Lots of resources for training (if you have time to take advantage), 401K match, good managers (in my experience, this varies widely), employee resource groups. Also have tons of site all over the US and all over the world, which could be good for people with a partner who moves locations often (though the con is that promotional opportunities may require moving sites, though this is less common with higher-level positions). Lots of talk around diversity, equity, and inclusion at high levels, though it hasn't really filtered all the way down in lots of areas.
Decent pay Rich history Large company opportunities
Great place to work. Friendly environment.
Strong leadership. They care about their employees and work hard to provide continuous development.
Up until May 8th, 2023, I was very happy with the benefits and flexibility of this job.
Pay upon hire is good, job security, no overtime, lots of different positions to shift into if needed
The company has pretty good benefits
They treat you right. That’s broad but accurate
Starting pay is higher than competitors. Low merit increase. Coworkers are helpful and nice. Good tuition reimbursement.
None it’s a great job
Lots of learning experience, benefits, schedule. The work load isn’t too much. The co workers are great if you avoid talking to the snarky office guys.

Good work life balance, ability to work remote or at least hybrid. Decent pay for a new grad position and tuition reimbursement after being with the company for a year. Working in aerospace is cool.
","large corporation issue of having to wait on other teams for months to get projects done
Going the wrong direction. Top heavy, bureacratic leadership. Will make work miserable to encourage quitting. Not as flexible as it should be. No longer the ""Best Place to Work"". 25 plus years, most of it in engineering, lowest point in my experience due to hard nosed MBA types that seem to think we have to be in a company owned box to do the work.
Hybrid work is no longer hybrid. The definition was changed and its now RTO for everybody except remote workers. You review yourself bi-annually and bi-weekly. Metrics are about cost and schedule performance regardless of roadblocks and setbacks. You do your own training online. You do your own IT online. You do your own HR online. Too many mtgs. Confusion and chaos reigns. Managers are hit and miss and suffer from the same issues as their employees with no solutions. Asking for help gets you more assignments. Too much work, not enough people. No one is applying for open positions. Hard to advance, too many hoops to jump through. Company used to be a great place before it went through three buyers and mergers and was swallowed up by a big fish. You're just another brick in the wall now.
Recently, corporate has decided everyone is to be on on-site even though we all joined due to having a hybrid role. They are unwilling to work with anyone, be flexible, and have lost all moral in the department.
Unfulfilling, hard to find motivation, lack of sense of community. Typical boring office job.
Most folks lost historical Rockwell Collins bonus at buyout, too much red tape, too many management layers, some management has a don’t care attitude.
They took away our bonuses, only the rich bosses get it. They took away sick time/PTO. We used to have PTO , vacations, and sick time, now we only have Vacations and PTO. We have to constantly ask/push for raises/ promotions and always have to move to different programs in order to make more money. New supervisors/ managers are very incompetent and never care to learn the product nor the people, they rely on leads to do all their work. Lots of drama and problematic people that's VERY hard to work with in every program, management won't take care of them to keep peace.
Average age of most workers is very high (50+), which leads to a relatively dull work environment. Upward mobility seems to be difficult and takes a long time to be considered for advancement.
Can't think of any, great place to work
Don't go above and beyond and try to make the place better. They just want to push product out, regardless of quality. Senior management also does not hold vendors accountable to get quality parts in and in a timely manner. They can keep going on with 500 day lead times and when the parts finally get to the facility, they fail. Oh and forget about having a good amount of vacation time until you've been there for 10 years.
bad leadership structure for esculation
- Complex system software and intensive processes and documentation slows down the pace of growth - NO Variable pay (Performance pay), no stocks - NO annual bonus
Need to go into office sometimes
Not a fan of the communication with higher-up departments. I know they have a lot of employees to manage, but keeping people filled in would make transitions so much easier for them and for us.
Feels like a small group of people do the majority of work Stressful environment with a lot of red tape
Insurance no co pays only deductible obligation
-The top down decisions can be a complete 180 at times. -Trying to get what needs to be done across departments can be a major hassle.
Can become very bureaucratic…slow moving.
Upper management genuinely does not care about the wellbeing of, as I directly quote from one of my former ""cell leaders"", ""The Help"". If you value your mental health, physical safety, and/or career progression I highly caution against working for this company. They falsely advertise to prospective employees perks that are, as I directly quote from my former supervisor, ""on their way out because they do not support the needs of the business"", yet are still being advertised to lure prospective employees in (a huge example of this being flexible scheduling!) The best comparison I have to my experience working at this company is like going to a public high school everyday, which is rather dysfunctional given it is supposed to be a professional workplace. I can't say this enough, but I highly recommend looking elsewhere to work if you value your mental health, physical safety, and/or career progression. If you are a woman, I caution you even more against working for this company, as men walk in the door making more than the women. Men are genuinely given more opportunities for career advancement within this company. A perfect example being I walked through the door with a bachelor's in science from UVM and was making 19.50 hourly whereas a new high school graduate (male) walked through the door making 19.75 hourly.
- Far below average compensation, with raises far below even inflation - Recurrent slashes to benefits - Terrible work/life balance - Constant stress and pressure to work harder and longer hours - No one uses their vacation because they'll be blamed for failing to meet deadlines - Always more work to do than what could possibly get done - Huge emphasis on arbitrary, meaningless deadlines that are often impossible to meet - Absolutely no concern for employees as human beings, or their mental or physical health - Refusal to offer promotions to even the most productive workers (I have been referred to as ""indispensable"" by my manager, and am still waiting for a promotion that was promised years ago) - Adversarial relationship between managers and subordinates; they are constantly trying to find reasons to punish and pay less - I honestly don't know what the managers do all day, there's no tangible benefit to their roles besides pressuring employees to work harder
Gets slow sometimes so there's that
low pay for existing employees, very limited progression or ability to promote high performers, increase in workloads but reduced resources to support
Onboarding took a long time
oppurtunities to try different things
There's a lot of incompetence
They’ve recently reduced the benefits packages and health insurance isn’t great. Lots of micromanaging and too many chiefs not enough Indians. Also they forced all the hybrid employees to come in 5 days a week Despite promising new hires flexible work schedules. Honestly wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a low stress flexible job.
None that I can think of
Not many options for pay bumps quickly as I thought.
Can be a lot of hours on busy weeks Forcing people back to the office
Not enough training or communication with the employess
some supervisors expect to much out of one person. some pick favorites and let others get away with more laziness
Work life balance can be bad
Lots of waste. Political. Upper management has poor understanding of operations and engineering.
Disorganized, efforts and work isn’t recognized or understood.
Depending on what line and shift work in. There seems to be a constant conflict between shifts on who to hold accountable. Line leads and supervisors pressure workers and work politics are in place. Lots of favoritism with supervisors and workers.
The location of service center
Pay could be better to keep up with the times
Uncommunicated changes that impact the employees at every level
To many layers of management
Not as competitively compensated salaries offered
Not easy to grow and make change
Company has become very large over the past few years.
Executives are bleeding the company dry and losing talent day after day.

Was promised work-life balance in the interview, often worked more than 50+ hours a week. Management did a horrible job of trying to provide any work-life balance. There is a ton of red tape, for both project approvals and to even suggest feedback. Management would ask for feedback on process improvements, and then turn around and shoot down any ideas brought up. Perfection was expected from Day 1 and the training was lackluster at best, non-existent at worst. Severe crunch to get work completed and often leading to major mistakes. The workload was so high and unrealistic, that they have experienced multiple times of high turnover and are continuing to face the same issues. Company Culture was a ""win this program no matter what"". This attitude has a major negative impact on morale. Overall, was a negative experience and I would not recommend this job to anyone else.

Top Management, Pay, Senior Leadership
Management is OK and technical lead not great
Selling actuation to Safran. How does this affect everyone
Hard to earn promotions with constant management changes.
No flexibility Leadership makes rash decision Lack of leadership communication
-Not a pay master -More challenging work
Things got rocky after we were bought out and then merged. The new management seemed pretty out of touch with our team's strengths and what made us so effective in the first place. Their decisions often made our work more complicated instead of driving us forward.
There is lots of extraneous process
poor control over current supply chain, too centralized, inconsistent subjective employee policy and enforcement
None I can think of
Small company experiencing growing pains
Management is OK and technical lead not great

Collins is the same as any other large company. You can't trust middle/upper management to be loyal to you over the long run. They'll make broad changes and realignments that will probably impact you negatively in some way at some point in your tenure here. regardless of how hard you work, the contributions you make, or even how much your boss likes you. Keep this in mind and don't get too invested in this company. If something negative does happen, don't take it personally. Take the experience you gain and move on to the next thing. That's what I'll be doing in a few weeks.
More upper management than needed Small % raise per year rather than giving you a promotion Doesn't pay well or competitively for the area. Once hired,they won't fire them unless they were violent. You can not do your job or sit around all day and keep your job, I guess that's a positive for some people...
HR at rgm engineering is a joke. No help!
Upward mobility within org seems to be manager dependent unless you are wiling to change departments.
-Not a pay master -More challenging work
Poor Senior Management Change Fatigue Low Morale
Didn't train employees properly. Put people new to soldering in difficult areas that require alot of training. Managers didn't seem to check up on their employees much. Everyone got same pay for different skilled jobs.
It is very bureaucratic and slow
We were isolated from upper management so there was little opportunity for growth.
Management does not provide leadership, it is more chaos than anything else. Communication is terrible. Management does not respond to requests for help.
Learning opportunities are there but at times not given capacity to pursue them.
Changes to the organization have caused major disruption to established processes. Deadlines remain the same with triple the amount of work. Members of our department are regularly working before 6am and/or working until midnight. Responses are required immediately, making the job about putting out fires everywhere instead of dedicating time on one task until completion. There is absolutely no attempt to help employees who explain they had to work on weekends to complete tasks. Three to four mandatory (read: unnecessary) daily meetings a day - how can we get our work done when there are constant interruptions in workflow? It doesn't appear that senior management has a plan to lessen the burden placed on departments.
Big company processes and multiple levels of leadership. Culture shifted since bought in 2018 by UTC and further after merger with Raytheon. Specifically, the incentive (bonus) structure used to be for everyone and made you feel like your efforts directly affected that part of your income each year, however, new structure only provides bonuses to P5/M5 and higher. 5-year outlook is solid, but Collins is at the tail end of selling equipment from the boom of early 2000s architecture. There's some concerns with lack of traction selling ~2015 architecture updates. Greater concern on 15 year outlook but the company knows we have a problem may not realize how big the problem is.
Lacks culture, empowerment, and motivating factors towards production.
Made up of LOTS of different divisions with entirely different cultures so your mileage will vary - if reaching out to learn about the company, try to find someone at the site you're looking at. The industry is also cyclical so expect layoffs every 5-15 years, or whenever the company wants to cut costs. Plus only 2-3% ""merit raises"" every year unless you're an exceptional performer in which case you MIGHT get 4%. This makes it easy to fall behind your market salary rate and it's almost impossible to get an adjustment without an outside job offer. Difficult for mediocre employees to get fired which I guess could also be a pro for some people?
Culture is cutthroat Long hours
Less room for growth, position and salary wise.
Constant change given the many mergers they've experienced.
Very little information on closing of current location. Very little Human Resource help regarding programs, etc, that are available to displaced employees.
like many other places, jobs stagnate. I know engineers with more expeerience that only make 5% more than me just because the company doesn't bump up pay much without you making a more drastic show with a competing offer etc. The company is also big, and maybe just my luck is bad, but the culture often feels dry and somewhat boring.
Not very good salary increments for current employees
Not many issues so far
Health insurance has high deductible. 401k matching isn’t high. Wish they use a different provider such as Fidelity instead of Alight.
None I love the job
Pay, it’s slow but steady

The company takes the approach of throwing you in the deep end with little to zero transition time or training.

The vpn system was glitchy, causing many wfh delays. Tuition reimbursement doesn’t start until being with the company for a year which can really set back your financial/educational goals. Starting remote as a new grad during the pandemic was difficult, but being on site in Cedar Rapids seemed depressing too (at the time it seemed very eerily empty, maybe it has changed since then). Hiring manager and more senior engineers didn’t accurately describe the job to me while I was interviewing, I would not have taken the job had I known what it really entailed. Most of the people on my team have since quit so they must not have liked it either. Maybe if I had been on a direct team in a different role, collins would have been better.

1. I get a marginal $100 discount on my rent. I find that to be quite pathetic, insulting even, considering how much time I spend slaving away at this poorly run, mismanaged apartment community. 2. It's incredibly easy to accrue overtime hours—it's almost laughable. But again, this is only possible because due to the absurd amount of operational inefficiencies that plague the property management team. My work-life balance is non-existent and management is robbing investors of a higher NOI on their assets because they're incompetent! A true lose-lose situation! 3. Progression is based on competence, intellect, work ethic, and merit...just kidding. If you're looking for a company where you can advance fairly, save yourself some time and look elsewhere. 4. When I go to my next property, I'll know exactly what NOT to do because management can't seem to do anything right.
Overall, I'll say good place to start you career
I’ve had a very pleasant experience the company and people. I am included and valued in my team and feel held to a high standard, as they hold themselves. It’s not an easy job, but it is rewarding
The hiring manager was excited to have the department's first copywriter and hired me because of my experience. Her goal was to make me an integral part of the creative process and someone the team would come to for strategic guidance.

(Pto does not roll over though). 12 week paid maternity leave and 2 week paid for fathers Personally, the managers I have had are great and truly care about employees and understand worklife balance.

Regarding the particular property I'm assigned to: 1. Lack of adequate training. 2. Lack of standards for the entire office. 3. Inappropriate work environment. 4. Weak leadership that doesn't hold ANYONE accountable. 5. Operationally inefficient and disorganized leading to poor resident-management relations and less-than-stellar community reviews.
Slightly understaffed, could be better in the staffing department.
It’s an office job, so there is a lot of stationary work in the entry level positions
The hiring manager quit 4 months into my tenure and the manager who replaced her did not see the value of having a copywriter. She expected me to reach out to the team to create work for myself, rather than making me an integral part of the team. She often forgot about me in meetings, overlooked my contributions and didn't really engage me.
If you don't set boundaries or expectations of your manager, then you will be taken advantage of and never get any support when you need it most.
Salary negotiations after working for a while are difficult
not always aware of changes that happen in the company
There are no cons for this company
Annual salary increases were low
Promotions and pay are slow to come by. Upper management does not typically want to request for more pay or promote within. Needed to leave the company for a higher position and more salary.
Timing Guidelines are harsh Not all Teams are great to work with
Pay is not as competitive with other jobs in the same field.
No cons to provide or report

Like I mentioned in the title, can feel old school and corporate.
Burnt out Boomers that need to retire. Not a great culture if you have a family.
Can get monotonous and boring. No real room for upward mobility
Health insurance is below average..
Insurance could have better plans
Benefits: maturity leave is short, 401K
- Get fired without any warning and they won't reach out and understand your situation before they fire you. - rules goes against some people and some not. - Very very bad human resources team "" it takes me more than 4 months to get an answer back "" - You don't get premonition because of what you know its because who you know such as I have 3 years experience I apply for higher position yet they give it to someone with 4 months experience "" as company rule its not allowed yet its about who you know"" while he don't know how to wire one motor but he knows the manager - Some manager are great but most are not. - I wouldn't recommend it for long term.
People are severely underpaid. They will lowball the F out of you if possible. Do NOT take their first compensation offer. We are but a number to the executives (whats new when at a big corp). Company is SO focused on being ""woke"" and spending so much money forcing it's employees to take ""diversity classes"" so they can say they are inclusive and with the times. Goes without saying but those at the top are granted bonus after bonus while us lowly workers who oversee so many day to day operations get MAYBE a $1,000/year raise (thats $83 extra a month). Have insanely outdated systems that cause constant issues, but the systems are cheap so they would rather stick with them than invest in a solid program. Literally nothing is streamlined AT ALL High turn over due to burn out, low pay and incentives, lack of trust in the execs. Even long term employees have decided to leave to work elsewhere Good stepping stone place to get some professional experience but I think for most this is not a long term company.
They hire apathetic staff to manage properties for owners and not all Regional managers truly care. The Property manager worked about 25-30 hours a week and the property looked horrible. The owners would come to town and they had some lame excuse. They do not follow proper safety procedures, contracting, and while the property may be great. You literally watch upper management make excuses to the residents and the owners of why things are not done correctly.
Stressful, Cushman forgot who we were and where we came from.
The downside is the compensation & benefits are seriously lacking in comparison to similar positions in other markets. There is no cost of living increase, the annual bonus is a slap in the face, and the 401k match is the lowest I’ve seen.
The company goes through cycles of being understaffed.
None to note. Maybe lack of a clear advancement plan.
Must push hard for career progression
Workload can be hard along with getting help from management to fix issues. The salary did not justify the workload.
*I can’t never take my pto because I have to get someone to take my entire property load. Especially in the summer everyone is trying to vacation. * They withheld out minimal pay raise for 2.5 months. *Low pay compared to industry standard and the property management gets bonuses the accountants do not. * no upward mobility *no direction or structure
Pay increases could be better
competitive pay, turnover, executive leadership relatability, recognition
Pay is not that great, training is rough
No central management system Many processes are unclear and do not exist. No litigation department There is an incredible amount of work with some down time.
Management is not organized, large work loads
The internal culture between teams.
No on-site IT support Advancement depends on Client approval
Compensation does not meet the workload.
Slow rate of internal job growth
Not as fun as it once was.
Susceptible to hiring freezes and lay offs
You need ti know someone higher up to be considered for promotion
Usual cons of a working for a large company
None that I can think of.
Overworked and little pay for amount of work
There is none to speak of.
Work too many hours for not enough pay.
It can be stressful at times.
They switch you accounts often and without much of a heads up
Very large organization so it can be hard to move into different areas with certain silos in place.
no assistance or support from upper level for much anything
Not a lot of guidance when it comes to learning it’s a throw you to the wolves type of place. One of the managers was so bold as to think it was okay getting my attention by shoving me in the arm.
Usual cons of a working for a large company
Benefits did not kick in for 6 months due to HR forgetting to enter my information. Benefits were suppose to start Day 1 of employment. Wasn't paid for 2 months due to HR entering the wrong address. They registered my information for multiple states, Missouri and Massachusetts. Which I had no ties to. Double the taxes. HR wouldn't respond for WEEKS regarding these issues. No escalation or support from management. Management didn't even know who to email outside of the catch all email address. Toxic work environment. A lot of drama and pushing that it was a fun environment when everyone was actually miserable and would go behind your back to leadership if you asked for help. Literally no one actually knew what they were doing or what was expected of them. No training or clear goals. Low pay and taking advantage of employees who worked very hard and had been there for years. Would bring on new employees with much higher salaries, offer no promotion roadmap or raises, and then tell everyone not to discuss compensation. I notified I wasn't going to work until I was paid the correct amount (the second time it happened), and my leads called the police for a welfare check because I wasn't reporting to work online. Meanwhile, still no response from HR after a week of calls and emails. Then tried to fire me due to ""abandonment of job duties"" I left, and then 75% of the team quit within 2 months including management. I have had 4 close friends who worked in different departments and cities entirely that have quit and share the same terrible experience. Lastly, even though I could keep going, they did not send me my tax form for this year, and they never responded to me after weeks of emails and calls. I hate giving bad reviews, but this was the most astonishing experience I have ever had. I left a bad environment at a small company and thought a larger corporation would have solid processes support. Complete opposite. Please do your research and deeply consider joining this company.
None that I can think of.
Overworked and little pay for amount of work
There is none to speak of.
The top 10% will crush many of the others if you don't watch out and management won't do anything about it because they bring it big $$$ and then they are given the big deals and don't share, or share crumbs, so it is self-perpetuating. Age old industry problem for commission-based or bonus based player-coach models. Rare to find the truly caring mentor.
Leadership Team Building Employee Dialogue Employee Turnover
Work too many hours for not enough pay.
It can be stressful at times.
Slow growth. not much opportunity for growth. good for entry level.
- Career development seems very lackluster - Some accounts can be disorganized and confusing
Fast paced, heavy workload, middle management in client accounting department lacks knowledge and skill set. Pay is too low.
The incessant focus on diversity and ""resource groups,"" i.e., struggle session groups and balkanizing the workforce based on race and identity groups, is rather annoying and quite polarizing.
i have no negative feedback
DE&I programs are absolutely out of control! And while employee growth is valued, there are not clear paths laid out to necessarily help with that.
Hard to move up the ladder
Slow to promote at any time
Lots of red tape and no transparency.
Yardi is not my favorite system
Benefits started deteriorating ever since the preparation of the firm going public.
Nothing negative to share about my time.
Vertical growth opportunities are present however sometimes feel limited dependent upon turnover and team size.
I was allocated 50/50 to two accounts, but essentially the workload was like having two full time jobs. Work is remote but very stressful and overbearing. I felt like I was a body placed in a seat and I had Sr. Managers corroborate this perspective. The job and expectations I discussed in my interview didn't align with the actual role. Significantly underpaid for the work I was doing. I applied for an Admin role, ended up in a Manager position that operated more like a Director. I was directly in contact with the client to resolve issues, managing 6+million dollars in expenses monthly. I was referred to as the Director of Lease Admin constantly however I was being paid basically an entry level salary. Extremely high turnover. Again, work is non stop as you may work with colleagues in other countries that are 12 or so hours ahead. Once your day ends, their day is just beginning and your inbox fills up while you sleep.
Too much red tape and too many layers of process.
Major funds wasted and repairs slowed from excessive delays
Nothing to speak of in my limited time spent there
Unorganized Retroactive On boarding Training Development Advancement Opportunities Promoting from outside Over selling but under delivering Pay Manipulation Scare Tactics
- Career development seems very lackluster - Some accounts can be disorganized and confusing
i have no negative feedback
DE&I programs are absolutely out of control! And while employee growth is valued, there are not clear paths laid out to necessarily help with that.
Very large company so you don’t always get to know everyone
Can't think of any yet.
Slow growth. not much opportunity for growth. good for entry level.
lack of training and no communication from leadership
No cons at this time.
Client was unrealistic and overly demanding
Favoritism and Nepotism. If you don't have a rich daddy or you aren't related to someone in that office, good luck trying to break into the business.
Terrible IT department. For such a huge company, you would assume they could get this together.
It is time consuming job
The culture and work environment is messy

Being a peer educator is the best way to gain experience teaching and is the best way to stay connected to the university. I was able to connect further with students younger than me as well as faculty/staff.

Living in Atlanta, Georgia and the city life
I truly enjoyed my time at GT working as Assistant Editor for Hivemind Speculative Fiction Magazine, the head editor/professor is a delight to work with and always bring interesting and exciting ideas to the table. You are free to flex your creative muscle while being very fairly compensated for a part time position while continuing your studies. Highly recommend as a GRA position
Work life balance is phenomenal
great job - love working with the alumni!!!!
Remote work options, good management
great students who are creative
Very nice educational institute in the U.S.
State of the art computing facilities to run experiments
Plenty of smart students to work with Great guidance
The graduate students tend to get along and work well together. It creates a better environment.
Decentralizing makes it easier for each department to move independently Students can get valuable understanding of workplace politics Students have the opportunity to learn new skills under the tutelage of an experienced professional
The job is very good
High flexibility and great support from advisor
Exciting projects and real life skill development.
Flexibility with PTO and schedule
- Two weeks of paid vacation a year, decent for a graduate student - Research assistant monthly pay is about $500 more than teaching assistant monthly pay. Either way, the stipend alone is not enough to cover rent and living expenses in Atlanta unless you opt to room with someone

Everything about working at Georgia Tech is a delight, the people, the environment, etc.
Excellent university with excellent indepth courses, helped me learn a lot about data analysis
Great culture for employees to work
Helped find my passion in teaching and deepened my connection with and understanding of the taught material. Also was able to bond closer with professors and peers, and gained an invaluable network of friends and coworkers. There is a real sense of camaraderie and friendship, not just between TAs of the same course or section, but between those of other courses and sections. It is a great community that I am grateful to be a part of.

","Lower than market salary, little chance of merit raise. You have to get promoted to a higher job to get a raise.
The hours are sometimes tough! You must provide office hours and these could end up being 8-9pm!
The workload is high while compensation . The community culture is also competitive meaning it may not be as warm and helpful as you might hope.
None, but it is dependent on who you choose to TA for.
Transportation could be more frequent
I honestly don't have any as of yet.
I neg¡ver get a race or anything besides base salary
Dont have much to say
No major cons experienced in the office. All was well there.
Very large class sizes, a bit difficult to get personalized attention.
It's just a very large campus so a walk is a WALK but other than that, none.
I don’t believe there are any, except for the low pay imo.
Easy to fall behind if you don’t ask for help
Limited hours available to work
-Vacation days are 10 hrs a month
Limited meeting times for discussion
Labor unions do not exist
Lower pay for postdocs and research scientists
The pay is not to good
tasks not super clear, and pay is rather low.
Being around undergrads in your late twenties
Long hours, no support, harsh deadlines, yelling
Working with various departments such as tech can sometimes slow down the pace of work, but still having access to these various experts is such a huge benefit of working for a large university like GT.
none that i can think of
boss was not a good fit for the position and did not understand purpose of job (only wanted to reaise money)
None, maybe that we have to go into the office once a week.
poor pay for good work over long period
the stipend might not be enough to live near the school
Might take a while to get a Ph.D.
The salary could be higher
It's like most grad school programs. Stressful environment. Some professors show a lack of care or support. By year 5, all you can think about is when you can get a job. They are very stingy with health benefits and pay fairly low when compared to other grad schools of similar ranking or location.
There are some places that lack liasons because of the hiring shortage and it delays things because everything becomes exceedingly inflexible but it may just be because of USG There is a deficit of experienced professionals and it leads to students running everything or being relegated to mindless grunt work
raises and promotion is slow.
Low stipend as a GRA
The work load can be quite high at times.
Miscommunication between the company and Georgia Tech Salary
- Fees are ridiculous (>$600 per semester, including the summer semester) and cannot be waived - Health insurance costs $100 per month and has a high deductible (~$6000)
Super delayed financial-related work (e.g., funding coordination, conference reimbursement) Not enough industry connect at school level (only way to get those resources is from your advisor or personal connection)
Bureaucracies can be daunting, career path way may or may not be clear or helpful
Financially less appealing and hardship
Not enough time in the day to finish
low culture for the city population
Online courses can be hit or miss depending on professor
Public institution, pay is not as good
Overworked, underpaid, lack of work life balance
You may get lost if you don't know your way around. Being a large campus, there's a lot of moving around for classes
None, a great employer with a flexible schedule.
Poor salary ranges, hybrid, not flexible. Takes forever to negotiate
Depending on the professor, there might be cons, but I have none.
None! Very supportive environment with great mentorship
Not so good???Not so good???

Not very high pay, a lot of grading
The salary is not too high
old out of date state policies, budget constraints
The salary could cover the stay in any of the nearby facilities without a roommate or two. Also, graduate student researchers are the main driving force of the research but are paid at the minimum livable wage. Furthermore, the professors that recruit them expect 10 - 12 hour workdays.
Low payments, not much annual raise

Lot of drunk students, traffic horrible, overnight shift only, High turnover
Not nice to study so much
Hard to advance and traffic
No downside really, hours worked can vary over weeks
Budget. Hours. Location. Ceiling. Challenges
Not stable job and not need to work every week
Weather is hot and humid.
Experience can be very differents according advisor
I personally wish there was more fast paced projects, but for someone who enjoys a slow paced/ stress-free environment. This is the place to be.
You must do your research regarding each course before taking it, meaning you have to know what is the content being taught and whether previous students found this course taught in a good way or not.
They don’t pay market rate as of yet
There is a significant disparity between the expected time which a TA is permitted to work, and the reality of the time commitment a TA needs to make in order to actually run the course. Combining this with underpay TAs compared to TAs in almost all other departments at Georgia Tech, leaves an impression of apathy and disrespect from the College of Computing Administration.
Can sometimes be boring during a slow day
- low pay - some employees slack off, & their performance affects the team as a whole
Does not value graduate students, awful environment if you want to maintain your mental health. Student fees and insurance costs are absurd compared with other similar universities.
May end up needing to do a lot more than 20 hrs per week of work.

Atlanta is a beautiful city, but there are more desirable places to work in tech like Seattle.
- unnecessary information/guests during weekly training lectures
Pay is low for the work
work-life imbalance, high parking fees, high fees for nurseries for employees, high fees for camps for children,
No cons worth mentioning at all.

Good work environment Easy work
EA is a mixed bag. The talent at the company is truly incredible! A majority of workers I have encountered are driven, enthusiastic, and friendly. Direct people managers tend to be equally skilled, supportive, and easy to work with. The middle management and up does leave a lot to be desired, however. VP and Director level management, in particular, seem to come and go in fairly predictable 2/3yr periods. As they are replaced, new focuses, values, and reorgs all happen. It can be jarring, especially when you pour yourself into your goals for several years just to have the plan change before you can reap the rewards of your efforts. A company as large as this really needs more like 5 years to succeed in such widespread initiatives, unless any upper manager has the will, vision, budget, time, and authority to push through definitive changes rapidly (and none really do). Much of your experience at EA will depend on what team you are on and who you work with -- specifically, if you are tied to a studio you will have a very different experience than that of a centralized team. This job is fine if you have a sense of how larger companies operate, and a good nose for shifts in the wind, politically. As with most game companies, crunch time is a factor. There are regular title launch cadences and they will absolutely take charge of your time no matter what is at stake. The crunch hours are not nearly as bad as they (infamously) were, but they are still a factor.
Incredible work culture, very supportive mentors, well structured office management

More often than not you are locked in at the salary you started at upon hire. Many vets get the carrot on the stick treatment, if they do not attempt to seek competitive offers.
They try to make up for the low pay with fringe benefits. Too many levels of management People managers with no people skills
Tricky Customers, Angry Consumers, Less-Than=Pleased Players
Executive leadership has a bias towards confidence over competence.
Too slow. Its hard to get anything done.
got a very small annual raise.
Very Corporate. Lack of transparency from top down. Sudden closure of projects/studios.

The bigger the company, the bigger the target for criticism.
If you work on a legacy game like The Sims 4, you have to deal with a giant legacy codebase which doesn’t use the latest technology.
There are times when long working hours are necessary
- Goals and reviews were unclear - Hours are standard for finance, 50-70 hours depending on Close and Quarterly Cycle - High Pressure Environment
Salary and TC is pretty bad for tech overall, although it's about the best you'll get in games. Your experience can really vary depending on which part of the company you're in. Some of the top management decisions can feel arbitrary or ill-informed.
A lot of work sometimes!
working remote is not ideal at a megacorp
There is a 3 year contract limit
Can work long hours, but that's typical in any line of work at a certain level.
Nothing to comment at this point
- Takes advantage of people's excitement to work in gaming industry as opportunity to pay below market - Limited/slow growth - Robust support system (in Hyderabad), means extra/nonessential work is created to make HQ people feel important/relevant.
- Goals and reviews were unclear - Hours are standard for finance, 50-70 hours depending on Close and Quarterly Cycle - High Pressure Environment
Red tape ; political; inefficiency at times
High amount of Bureaucracy and seniority favoritism
Some senior leaders do not care about people / mixed bag Lack of work/life balance at times Pay is technically well-below market rate Would still recommend working at EA
Pay could be better. Im a few years in and inflation adjusted... making 10% less than when I started.
No cons to report from my time with the company.
Supervisors have some old behaviors that need to go with misogynistic things they try to bring up in passive-aggressive manners. Higher ups like CEO and directors are not transparent about what they need to improve on. Lastly, the way your fiscal goals are structured in NOT efficient at all.

Tends to foster a competitive work environment where peers are pinned against each other.
tight deadlines can make sure poor choices, but this varies greatly from project to project.
As is with most bigger companies there is the occasions of unexpected mass layoffs or studio closures. The communication can be minimal at times and requires a bunch of follow up. With a bigger company and studio it can require extra follow up personally to be recognized for work you have done even among your own manager.
Can be hard to maintain work life balance at times.
Very political, more than other corporations
No clear path of growth. Slow to appreciate employees
Lots of business lingo, leadership just kind of Does Stuff™, not great business models, the bad people are really bad On a bad team: - crunch - unable to handle criticism - will shove you into whatever is on fire - sudden reorgs will send you to new teams
None at this time. Good support.
Doesn't have great work life balance.
Has some politics like all big companies
On the surface everything said publicly and promoted by the ERGs on EA's culture, diversity, equity and inclusion looks great. However, in my experience, their words were inconsistent with behavior and treatment of those not in power. Based on my experience, leadership in many of the organizations was unable to deliver consistent strategy and data driven results. I saw frequent directional and organization transformations and was told that they were due to a lack of results delivery and poor strategy. I frequently saw decisions made without accurate and relevant data to support an action even though many in the organization were begging leadership to make data driven decisions. This along with fears for the predicted recession, has resulted in a hiring freeze and an announcement that they started laying off 6% of their workforce this year. In my experience, I saw individuals with reported relational skill gaps promoted to people management without receiving adequate coaching on how to show up ethically, without bias and with a servant leadership mindset as there was no change in their behavior to those around them. I saw some of those managers on the extended leadership team actively praised and rewarded by senior leadership even though they actively bullied individuals with less senior titles who asked questions. I saw some of the same people take credit for work done by others. Their actions perpetuated a culture of what I felt was hurt and no accountability. I am aware of two women who reported being sexually assaulted by co-workers to their superiors, had HR involved, each had felt scared and reported retaliation, saw their careers suffer and saw that nothing was ever done to the men involved.
Lots of meetings across different time zones.
tended to be political, particularly around career growth.
Difficult to move up the ladder
Pay could be more, leadership changes
Somehow people tend to fail upwards. As in management doesn’t have the best experience in their areas of expertise because of constant reorganization. So you have social centric people placed in PR roles and PR people positioned as GTM experts without prior experience.
Highly political, not much innovation or risk-taking
They under pay most positions
Promotion in EA is a bit of a slow process.
Some software is very old and you get stuck updating old tech. But there is room for change
Not enough room to grow/expand on career.
No free food, paid food not good
At the business level, they don't really know the employees (which admittedly is hard in such a large company). Which makes the lay-offs extra painful when its done by a faceless entity. Though the separation package is fair and there are resources to try and help you.
Most teams are hoping to continue operating like it’s 2010. Leadership cannot agree on a way forward and bottlenecks everting else

Fast paced so if you enjoy change and challenge this is the spot for you.
none that I am able to think off
During times of inflation, compensation didn't reflect amount of experience current employees brought to the table. It became common practice to hire outside rather than promote within which killed any motivation to perform above and beyond,
None I can think of
No clear direction from leadership.
Not much to say on cons. Good place
Incompetent supervisor.... Very poor leadership and worst I've ever had
high technical debt for older titles
Large organization with some frustrations resulting from that.
Do not provide better opportunities for employees in other departments
Pay could be more, leadership changes
Changes of plans can be become threatening
Somehow people tend to fail upwards. As in management doesn’t have the best experience in their areas of expertise because of constant reorganization. So you have social centric people placed in PR roles and PR people positioned as GTM experts without prior experience.
Needs physical training but for stronger people ok
Company has lots of reorgs.
Highly political, not much innovation or risk-taking
Matrixed structure leading to long decision making process
Work could be tedious from time to time, equipment occasionally faulty.
Most teams are hoping to continue operating like it’s 2010. Leadership cannot agree on a way forward and bottlenecks everting else
Position comes with a lot of toxicity from the players and inside the company. Be prepared for anything to be said to you and don't push back as it is not allowed. No room for growing with company, seemed to hire outside for positions that several people in the company were more than qualified for. Underpaid for the market as other companies are paying almost double. No bonuses are given to this position but the ones above it are. Raises were insulting. While everyone above you is getting off for 10 days at the end of the year you will be required to work but will get OT for some of the days. For a company that says its diversified, I did not see it for the employees. There is a good ole boy/girl network. If you get sick and need time off be prepared to file FMLA every time because they do not accept doctors notes.
the cons are the same with any corporate
Mobile Leadership advocates strategies that were cutting edge 10 years ago. Perhaps excellence in executing would help, but EA Mobile lacks expertise here as well. Management showcases the need for psychological safety by leaning into anti-patterns.
Laid off via zoom call
It's a mixed bag. I wrote the more salient points above, both good and bad.
Limited space for creativity due to the scale of the company
Can be stressful dealing with customers all day during certain times of the year or when there are issues.
None that come to mind.
There is quite a bit of politics and beureacracy in the company
None it was a great place

big ships arent nimble to changing tides.
Difficult tools, often with poor or nonexistent documentation
This may vary depending where you're at. Similar job politics people may hear or encounter across the industry
Crunch is an issue here
The pay is less than average. About 3 months a year you will be asked to work overtime.
Very little opportunity for growth or innovation. The company is heavily invested in a small number of popular game franchises and rarely makes opportunities outside of those franchises available. Its games are built with obsolete frameworks or poorly-maintained proprietary tools. The company imposes severe restrictions on what projects employees are allowed to work on outside of work. Any personal project that even vaguely relates to the game industry is generally disallowed without special permission from HR.
Electronic Arts tries its best at balancing social issues with its business interests. Sometimes that means that it does not take a stance that is forward thinking. I understand the reasons, but its disappointing.

The people, benefits and opportunity.
Grainger pays well and has allowed me to work fully remote, though the majority of the company have hybrid positions. I have had a great experience with my colleagues and generally value leadership. Grainger is an inclusive workplace, with a lot of groups to join supporting all different walks of life. Nearly all of my bosses have been supportive and understanding people who value and respect me.
Somewhat like a personal shopper. You manage your time.
Good pay. Longevity in a role. Good vacation.
Everyone talks about the Grainger culture, and it is true that it is like no other. I feel very comfortable working here, and I feel valued. I have been able to make many friends and learn various parts of the business. Grainger has a very welcoming, kind, and inclusive work environment. We get the job done but also like to have fun while doing it. For younger people, there is a great new-hire cohort program that allows you to explore the area and make new friends.
- I have had really good co-workers and a supportive boss - Get to be on the move everyday, rather than sitting in a cubicle - Really good benefits
From the CEO all the way down Grainger provides an opportunity for everyone to succeed and grow within the organization. There are many great team members who are willing and eager to help you develop and enjoy a great journey. The company offers excellent benefits and a great overall Total Rewards Package.
I love working with Grainger and watching how it can improve the working parts of small town America. Growing up in a small town where everyone know everybody its nice to be able to go into a mill and know that you are there to help provide PPE so that they can work safely and make it back home to their families.
Grainger - work/life balance - priceless. Grainger benefits! Grainger support! Company listens to feedback and acts on it.
Leadership works to maximize shareholders wealth… at the expense of the employees.
Cross function collaboration, felt like everyone was on one team Grainger. People stay here a long time and are very loyal, lots of internal opportunities.
Great salary and benefits. Strong leadership who is proactive about keeping the company strong. Regular performance reviews and opportunities to learn and grow. Remote positions available. Diverse workforce. Working hard to be more inclusive.
Fellow Associates are fun, informative and likable Time Off Policy
Principals for sure. All of the Grainger principals are things I keep with me in my personal life as well. Teamwork and support across the board with leadership, someone is always able to help or get you in the right direction. We get involved in the community locally and in all cultural communities as well. Benefits are amazing and Grainger does the best when it comes to pivoting to reflect the economy and keep their employees thriving.
Work from home and in the field.

- Cares about work life balance - Fair Compensation
Great benefits Yearly raise Night shift differential
Work life balance, friendly people
A Fortune 500 company that acts like a family owned company caring for each employee. My time at this company was incredible. I only left because of a career change into a completely different field or else I would still be there. Great benefits, good pay, good sales environment.
Great benefits if you know about them Pay is above average for some positions
Incredibly smart, respectful, diverse colleagues; little to no political drama or fractiousness (that I've experienced so far); very fair compensation and decent benefits; fairly flat management structure, at least on the GTG side you have a good chance to have contact with every level of the organization; a company deeply and truly committed to doing right by both internal and customer users and employees, and willing to both put their money where their mouth is, along with their people, and time, and effort. Willing to do the hard work to do things right. They are also strongly committed to keeping good people by giving many opportunities to move laterally across teams and departments in the company. The automatic 401k contribution (not a match, they put in 6% regardless of whether or not you contribute anything) is gold.
They try to do a lot of training and everybody is nice they are just weird. It is hard to describe but imagine working for the ""Flanders"" family.
Work Life Balance, competitive salary and benefits
the hybrid schedule was great.
Good Benefits Good Environment Excellent Leadership
Great Company to work for
Leader in the industry, people-centric, culture, ethical, inclusive, career growth and development.
It's an amazing company to work for; they have great benefits and a new facility in Louisville, KY. They offer great benefits, 401K match if you add to it or not; they offer stock benefits, employee discounts, and health benefits. They treat you to lunch sometimes.
Good team collaboration and work environment
Great company Good benefits Great culture Work life balance
Good option to make money when I was in school

Promotes work life balance and good place to work
I love my job, we genuinely care about our customers and they genuinley care about us as an individual. I appreciate Grainger for being my second family and truly being a great company to work for. I have not had a manager i have disliked ever or have ever mistreated me. They really choose their people well and it is an honor to be apart of the team!! Did I mention there is a raise every year? Or MANY positions its not all phones we have stores and distribution centers too!
Positive Culture Big time Company with Small Family Feel You create your own Destiny, put in the work/development and the runway is endless

Grainger has been a great company that truly cares about my time and professional development. I just reached my 1 year milestone here and the first year flew by. At recruiting events, I can proudly speak to the values Grainger has and how our principles have lead to our success as a company. I am looking forward to many more years at Grainger and would recommend this place to any of my friends!

Amazing place to work with senior leaders who really connect with workers. Great incentives, employee discounts, and PTO policies.
People are fantastic and culture is great
Fun to help customers with SIFs and other problems.
I like having the option to work from home or come into the office. I like all the open communication between leaders and team members. The Lake Forest office is a beautiful place.

Professional, good communication, inclusive environment
Staff is friendly and helpful
Very friendly, easy to move around company, and feels like family.
They are a good company that seemed to care about their people and invested a lot into training to lead to success
Benefits & Pay are outstanding. Supervisors left you alone if they knew you were busy 4 10 Hour Days with all the OT you want At the end I had supervisors that cared, listened, & knew the ""Grainger"" Process

Awesome place to work and wish I stayed
Adjusting schedule for family and customers.
nothing was that competitive, good 401K match.
Great pay, great upper management!
Grainger is a well rounded company that is constantly evolving to stay ahead of the curve. I have been with the company for over six years, have been in two different positions and have had four managers. My experience has been nothing but a success. They know that if your a success then they are a success, so they give you all the tools you need to get the job done. The base pay, commission and benefits are fare and competitive.
strong leadership and solid profitability results
Good people and environment. Fun to come to work most days
Good environment and great benefits
Great company and benefits, great team
Weekends off Nice staff Short commute for me
Pay, benefits, hours of operation
Too many to list. Freedom, Work life balance, compensation, culture
Great culture, opportunity to grow.
Grainger is a workplace where you can build a career, not just a job. There are many different development paths that I can take and with supportive leaders, I have been able to shadow other departments and take necessary training to build up mu skills for the next role. - The benefits are phenomenal! Grainger really takes care of their team members. The 401K vetted contribution from the company along with the profit-sharing bonus make this a standout compared to other companies.
","None at the time - great place to be
Upper management should come out on more sales calls to hear the voice of the customer.
Working fully remote is not a typical option, most people have to come into the office 3 days/week. While moving to other positions in the company is encouraged and managers are supportive of you growth and development, it can sometimes feel more of a political play to get a new role rather than strictly based on the interview or your goals with the company. I only recently was eligible for an annual cash bonus after nearly 5 years. When I started I received a stock payout bonus but that was eliminated pretty soon after I started.
Write ups for everything. Your errors, your attendance, your rate, forgetting product numbers. Write ups get you fired quicker. I put seasonal as a headline because I don't feel like this is a job to retire with. I haven't has the opportunity to see what the other departments are like. But everyone in my department are always unhappy and on edge. Feeling like they have to try out everyday and the uncertainty of not having your job due to rate. One month you could be a hero. Next month your a loser. Your being watched. Even when you go on breaks. A supervisor is watching you go and come back. This is the most strict job I've ever had yo work for. I haven't been able to make any relationships with team members due to the fact we can't talk to each other because of rate. This job is gor someone who has the energy to run up and down the aisles for 8 hours without a hiccup.
Did away with profit sharing. Did away with stock options. Did away with bonuses. Continue to eliminate commissions.
We work hard, so there are times you may be overwhelmed or feel like your peers are too busy to speak or ask a question to.
- Been stuck at 30 hours for a while, but if you stick with it, Grainger has a lot of opportunity! - Can have moments of being thrown into fixing issues you have not been trained to fix
Being a large company with many different departments we can have some processes that are complicated to navigate and can be frustrating at times. With that being said every team member has the opportunity to provide feedback and the company does a great job of listening to the feedback to help implement changes.
There are always hurdles with this job, just like with any job. However, Grainger provides a great team of people to help you overcome them.
Not too many! Driving distance to my territory.
Fees like employees with 20+ years have a target on their back. They use to reward longevity but now it’s a hindrance. Glad I jumped and took a buy out even during the pandemic.
Low pay for this type of role at other companies. Yearly increases below that of cost of living. Leadership consultant mindset, looking to make strategy decisions to make their mark, get credit, not by relying on facts and data. Claim to put customers first, love the term ""customer back"" strategy but don't walk the talk. Yearly reorganizations, personally experienced changing placement of team/renaming function 5 times in 4.5yrs
Large company so there is a lot of structure.
Below Standard Raise Managers HR Lack of diverse management/ team leadership
Turn over is the biggest con I have experienced. Our customers deserve a constant support team and sometimes the job is not for the employee that sits in the seat. Not having a consistant team and having to adapt with the change sometimes hinders the engagement with the team if it happens too much.
Some of the customers site are very hot and dirty.
You dont always feel like you have a voice.
None I can think of right now
I have no complaints with this company
Functionals areas (Sales, Supply Chain, Tech, etc) evolve and adapt at different paces. Leads to some alignment/consistency issues.
Very fast paced work, it's easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of inbound calls
Some processes are complicated preventing quick action to solve customer issues
The teams we supervise are large.
Too much adjustments, never stabilizes to current changes and changes before you are fully adjusted
Even if your doing better than your younger peers they will look for a reason to fire you. Age discrimination case. They will settle big $ than going to court.
Favoritism on the childish level is what you will experience working here as a minority. Racist subliminal comments made throughout my time at Grainger. People loosely choose what they want to do all day playing around, and throw the hardworkers under the bus! No team work! Toxic environment! Childish manager and leads ect...!!
- Room for growth - Very Big company
Working hours were high during the pandemic Be prepared to work 6 day weeks during peak
None that come to mind
Your mileage can vary somewhat depending on your immediate supervisor and their supervisor. I had an amazing leader but I had people I went through training with who had different leaders and their careers seemed short lived. It is somewhat a give and take when it comes to leadership. Advancement within the company is difficult. Many variables work against you at times and many hurdles must be overcome. It seems easier to get higher positions if people left the company for 2 years then applied back in at a higher level.
Hates remote work Management wants to track everything for ""productivity""
There really aren't many. Forward career growth is, as anywhere, limited to available positions in the levels above you (but they do want and try to recognize people wherever possible). Holidays and vacation benefits are below the industry standard, especially since the pandemic; there are 6-7 company holidays per year, unlike past places I've worked with 12-13 plus several floating holidays and wellness days. Coupled with a finite PTO system (reasonably fair), it leads to less time off than I am used to, which can be hard for family life.
They have a way and that is the only way to sale. They do not like traditional sales models. They have their noses in the air about the sale process.
Upward mobility and ability to promote beyond the director level.
They are turning this role into just a call center role with a demanded number of dials each day and expectations like a call center. Not how role was originally described and set to be.
No Cons at this time.
Nothing negative to say, happy there.
Can be challenging to navigate.
Extremely physically demanding. The warehouse isn't climate controlled, so you burn in the summer and freeze in the winter. The facility is so large you feel like a number. They work long shifts with very short breaks, 20 minutes for lunch and two 10-minute breaks on a 10-hour shift. It is a quota-based job so you have a certain number that you have to meet daily and every day they meet about the numbers they're constantly testing and retesting you on procedures.
Can't think of any cons
Not a lot of roles for advancement in my building
Told that with a degree I would be “overqualified”
Management communication is poor Hours are a lie Overworked, constant madatory overtime
None that I can think of currently
Same type of politics of any other large company
Always on the road driving.
dont care about works, money sucks, no hours
Stressful work load Not much work life balance
Takes a while to navigate. Massive company = lots of cooks in the kitchen, moving parts, and red tape. I was also a bit shocked at the lack of diversity/gender mix. It seems to be a focus for recruiters.
Limited growth opportunity to move up the chain of command
It makes you be the best you can be!!
Processes and Resources because they offer so many sometimes it is hard to navigate.
Can't think of any cons
Great talent so you really have to be intentional to develop and do the work to get promoted.
Told that with a degree I would be “overqualified”
Misuse of salesforce as a performance metric and not as a way to manage your sales business.
Management communication is poor Hours are a lie Overworked, constant madatory overtime
Not a lot of diversity - white boy club, very few women and POC. No longer fully remote
Hours get cut in a regular basis
dont care about works, money sucks, no hours
Stressful work load Not much work life balance
Nothing negative about this company
Since it is such a large company, Grainger is constantly evolving to make things better for its team members. While most of these changes are positive, there are some things that are overlooked, or are taking too long to change. There are a lot of processes we are currently modernizing to make less manual, but we have a long way to go!
Limited growth opportunity to move up the chain of command
Many people come and go do to the high expectations of the job. They make you work for the amount that you are compensated. Old equipment, company waits a long time before upgrading equipment.
It didn't pay what was expected
Wish pay was better. Don’t really know about changes until they are happening.
If you're looking for fast paced, this probably isn't the place for you
No cons to share at this time.
No real serious cons that i can think of
Misuse of salesforce as a performance metric and not as a way to manage your sales business.
It is hard to participate in volunteer events. Being a customer facing employee, my leader has to make sure it is okay with his leader who then has to make sure it's okay with their leader, that I can participate. There have been 3 volunteer events I have requested to participate in and have yet to be approved.
Limited Growth Opportunities, Unachievable Goals
Not a lot of diversity - white boy club, very few women and POC. No longer fully remote
Hours get cut in a regular basis
Nothing negative about this company
The inside sales role was simply a cold call sales job from the jump with metrics of following up with certain accounts every few weeks/months regardless of previous conversations so it was sometimes really stressful to HAVE to call someone again that told you to never call again
Was Mandatory 5 Days OT. Supervisors that don't know or care and will preach the Grainger Way but do the complete opposite. Always short staffed for some reason.

Micromanagement of Account Managers daily sales. Very poor leadership.
Nothing bad to say at all
A good amount of windshield time. Pay to daily run rate for what I bring to the business is not matched.
Too many inconsistencies, issues with management.
Nothing bad to share here.
A company this size is infiltrated by the government. In order to stay in good standing with all of the governmental regulations like EPA, OSHA, and the multiple civil movements Grainger is straying further to the secular world view and away from the biblical world view.
Work life balance could improve
Can be a bit labor intensive at times
Range of responsibilities is sometimes too broad
Cant think of anything negative
Strict attendance policy Strict quality policy
Full time opportunities are rare
Compete with Competitors better and faster
base pay could be a little more, but commission makes up for it.
Only thing I can think of is lack of discount for stock purchasing. The company makes the process easy to purchase but with the stock price being so high, its an expensive buy.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UC-Davis-Reviews-E32514.htm,"Great work place with good benefits
- I had the opportunity to teach in multiple departments, as UC Davis is highly cross disciplinary - In every post I had, the faculty were kind, supportive and understanding of the need for balance between teaching and research duties - Even though I was not guaranteed a contract, my department always made a genuine effort to do the very best they could to employ me
1. Great Pay for the area (well above state & local government but below private) 2. Great Benefits (you can go for a pension or matching 401k) 3. Lots of PTO & Sick time, tons of holidays 4. Pretty flexible with remote or hybrid schedules 5. Pretty Good co-workers 6. If you are on campus its a really beautiful spot to work
Overall I found the Continuing Edu department to be a great group of people to work with. The medical benefits were very affordable and even had a free options. The PTO and sick time were generous and the 410k match is 8% when you put in 7%. I have enrollment goals for each of my program which I find to be manageable and also receive a lot of support from our marketing and academic team to support each program i manage the enrollment for. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement as well changing positions within the university or the larger UC system.

","There aren’t any cons at the moment
- Wage was competitive when I arrived, but I saw no increase (not even to account for inflation) in the 6 years I worked there - I was in a graduate group that didn't have an overlying department, so TAing was not guaranteed by my department like it was for some others. This meant that I was responsible for seeking employment/interviewing every quarter (every 3 months) for 6 years, and I had to teach in multiple departments/disciplines just to make sure I was receiving a wage and remained enrolled.
1. Unionized positions have really good raises, un-repped positions tend to eat any budget reductions. Went 2 years without any raise or cost of living, while seeing repped position getting 5-7% 2. Having an internal view of how the UC systems spends money can be depressing, especially with how expensive it is too attend college. 3. Not particularly sophisticated in its administration 4. Management is a bit top heavy
Unfortunately, the salary is not competitive with private industry and is also arguably less than the main campus. Although they did do a salary assessment in 2023 to keep salaries competitive with the main campus.
Racist volunteers who will ask about your personal life.
No structure or expectations and poor manager/leadership.
Pay is not consistent with market and responsibilities.
Depends on your instructor- some are good at organization and some are bad.
The salary is low, need family support.
Field work can be borderline dangerous with the heat. Academia has a lot of drama.

Field work can be borderline dangerous with the heat. Academia has a lot of drama.
The pay is relatively low.
Lots of hours Late shifts Can be hard to juggle with school
- Since this is on the UC Davis Campus, during Academic breaks and Summer, there is no/very limited hours.
lack of career growth, office politics and bureaucracy
Benefits could be better in this job
difficulty in obtaining bridge funding or getting development to work to help raise funds.
There are no cons I would complain about
It was boring to work.
Slow to promote if any often prefer external candidates when openings appear low pay over administration
The weather can be a little extreme in Davis (the summers are hot/dusty/sometimes fire, the winters are cold/windy/rainy), HR can be a pain to get through when first applying/training, there's a little bit of barn drama sometimes but nothing that can't be worked through, paper documents are very inconvenient.
Lots of hours Late shifts Can be hard to juggle with school
Benefits could be better in this job
difficulty in obtaining bridge funding or getting development to work to help raise funds.
Not much availability to be promoted
No cons here. Everything is good
Part of a bureaucracy-- slow moving and occasionally nonsensical.
Not that I am aware of
Cliquey units, awful patient population
Employee parking wasn’t subsidized for lab techs, assistant researchers or junior specialists
So far my experience is good.
Not a lot of pathways for promotion for writers/editors
Low pay and not so exciting work.
Did not have any cons during my time
In my department, the workloads are vastly unmatched from grad student to grad student. One person might have a teaching assignment for a course that meets for 1.5 hours, once per week (1.5 hours/wk of class time), while the next person (same qualifications and pay) might have an assignment for two courses that meets for 2.5 hours twice per week (10 hours/wk of class time).
Can feel a little too demanding at times. Always have to be doing something as you might feel a bit micromanaged. Pay is just okay.
Low pay, micromanagement style, no one else to manage the lab except for the pi
Limited working hour for students
Can be physically demanding at times
Odd hours, heavy work load
No cons here. Everything is good
It’s a fast-paced job. Additional training for advancement.
Cliquey units, awful patient population
During the September it might be challenging to rent near campus
None I like it there
No Cons, everyone is nice
Not a lot of pathways for promotion for writers/editors
Not much trust given to student workers.
low pay and inconsistent supervision/mentorship
Sometimes there's not enough to do, so I am told to do menial labor
better training of new workers
1. Supervisors are micromanagers that check in every hour and don’t allow for free work and independence or creativity, solely to be a secretary to the supervisor and obey orders 2. Coworkers are very toxic, don’t want to talk to you, don’t want to help with teaching new things, not sharing load with you even during your lunch break while they’re not doing anything they’ll say “no you do it it’s your responsibility” 3. PI of the study is a surgeon who never even welcomed me to the team, passed my desk numerous times and never said hey or welcome, and when I asked why that was the case I was told she’s a busy surgeon, while I saw her charging for half hour and an hour regularly with others about her trips and food she tried. 4. Immediate supervisor started reprimanding me the day I finished training and started working. They were not because I didn’t do my job, they were because that’s how she functions. I even got yelled at after I had gotten back from a vacation, hadn’t even done anything yet and I wasn’t told welcome back or how was your trip just got a yelling in front of everybody at the meeting. Simply because I didn’t reply to my email while I was on vacation.
Limited working hour for students
no benefits or PTO, poor overall training given to employees, no place for student lab assistants to sit besides the work bench
Nurses have a voice and a lot of autonomy. Not much teamwork involved
Stiff course requirement even for student with M.S. degree
Higher education pay does not reflect the amount of work/expertise required
Can be physically demanding at times
Overally bureaucratic, union and tenure system means people stick around for longer than they should many times
No Cons here for student
Odd hours, heavy work load
It’s a fast-paced job. Additional training for advancement.
Leadership, low pay, under appreciated
--Worked into the ground with no relief due to the dean's office not paying for SRA's. The SRA salary often comes out of PI's own funds, so you'll be split more, asked to do more, and not receive any greater compensation for your efforts.
Low pay, especially considering the living expenses.
racoons are cuddly, but dangerous
Extremely dependent on boss / PI and lab
During the September it might be challenging to rent near campus
None I like it there
Everyone is overworked and under paid and the moral suffers. Students are not a top priority, which is disheartening given the cost of attendance and assumed prestige of the University
During summer, the stink of cow poo will surround some area of the campus
Crowded with students, non-competitive pay, toxic research culture
Pay student workers a higher base pay.
Not much room to grow due to most people retiring in their position & lack of age diversity
No Cons, everyone is nice
• Clicks between some organization leads, can feel very high school • Need more diversity in director positions • Feels like their harassment and discrimination team is there to prevent lawsuits from employees. Poor alignment between them and HR to confront problematic behaviors.
There is almost no cons.
The pay is only minimum wage
Trained people when it wasn't my job
Limited payment, not much things in the town
Potential low flexibility, high stress, terrible working environment *All depends on your principal investigator* *Phd is a degree, not a job. Depending on your field of study you may not be paid. If you do get paid, it won't be much.
Compensation is not enough and unable to plan for further with low pay.
Compensation is not competitive Office politics Cross-the-board salary increase doesn't motivate high performers
Sexual harassment, workplace bullying, and general exploitation gets swept under the rug.
- Poor leadership within the school - didn't listen to employee's thoughts/ concerns and felt disregarded - Seemed like there was tons of interpersonal conflict between many employees, faculty, and leadership - was a hostile environment and it constantly felt like ""this person hates this person"" - The school has 6 programs with a 7th starting in 2023, but it seemed like they were just creating programs to get money, rather than wanting to provide quality education for students. The online program cannibalized the in-person, the full time programs received full attention over the part time programs. The part time students felt disregarded. (And yet they're surprised they can't hit their admissions targets) - Poor communication from the top down - Lack of respect for individuals working hard - I heard some interesting feedback about people's yearly reviews (only a certain amount of people within the school could receive ""Exceeds expectations"" within a year) - Lack of culture within the school. One of the loneliest places I've ever been. - At this point, DEI seems more like talk than anything. Uncertain about tangible, actual practices. - Lack of work/life boundaries - supervisor would text at all hours/ all days - Very much a ""this is how we've always done it"" mentality - opposed to new ideas
The quarter system is difficult.
limited hours per week; some micromanagement
Very hot and dry in summer.
Student interactions might not be a great fit for everyone
Everyone is overworked and under paid and the moral suffers. Students are not a top priority, which is disheartening given the cost of attendance and assumed prestige of the University
During summer, the stink of cow poo will surround some area of the campus
Crowded with students, non-competitive pay, toxic research culture
Pay student workers a higher base pay.
Not much room to grow due to most people retiring in their position & lack of age diversity
None i can think of
Can be difficult to cross department lines
Salary may not be as high as other places but is made up for with the benefits. Can be very stressful working as a manager at UC Davis Health. Lots of policies and Human Resources can be challenging.

Free food and fun coworkers. Flexible schedule, just remember not to pass your 5th hour without a 30 min meal break. Not too difficult to get promoted to Assistant. Frequent pay increases from performance reviews.

If you're desperate for money, it's great. starts at $9 an hour and will give you insane hours if you ask. In my first 5 days i worked enough to have a gross pay of over $900. If you need a job immediately and are willing to ignore your personal needs to afford your basic needs, this works. You get no official meal on your shift. Rather, you are welcome to eat any mistake pizzas or pizzas that are too old to serve but fresh enough for you to have the courage to eat them. 20 minute break each day, but you aren't told. It's in your employee handbook and you'll have to bring it up yourself to get it. Pay every two weeks.
Free pizza, fun employees, 40 hours for full time. Part time is only 25 .
free food all the timeeeee,i guess this depends on location but i worked at 710 sublett rd in arlington texas to be exact.The managers never cared and there was always free food with no limit And it was easy to give out free food to friends and families who would come to the store. oh and smoke breaks !

Very flexible hours, healthy work environment, nice coworkers.
Discounted pizzas, Coworkers, breaks, and nearby storws
Card that you can eat at certain restaurants or other stores with$90/month loaded onto the card. Lots of pizza
","It got shut down by the owner
No full-time unless co-manager or higher. Fast-paced environment. When it gets busy, IT GETS BUSY. You will get constant criticism on topping portions and a strange amount of strictness over the cheese used. Sometimes management can be a little too serious at times and give unreasonable demands to the crew. It is hot in the kitchen, too. You will sweat a LOT.
Its too hot, the AC is always broken despite it being a brand new 5,000 lb unit, 3 ovens on the entire shift all at 465 degrees. dough machines don't work and wont bother to replace them, ovens constantly breaking as well. Unless you're on your knees you don't get appreciated or recognized to be honest its not worth doing more than the bare minimum. If shift manager, be aware that they don't care for your school or another job schedule like if you need 3 days off just to keep up with school work etc.)because they will want full availability. be prepared to close all the time unless you're a favorite if your better than other crew or fast that's when you can be promoted to shift, and unless someone quits or get fired its a lot harder to go up. good luck unless you are just there to be there collecting a paycheck. (Worked for 4.5 years , so giving everything I know)
Very low pay No advancement Working as a manager is mentally taxing
Raises are embarrassing, have to leave in order to get an adequate pay bump. Raises are pretty much 3% every single year. Promotions are only handed out to yes men/women. They brag about record profits, for how ever many months straight, but then continue to not give good raises, leave teams short staffed and over worked. A very large portion of the employees have been there a lot of years, and because of this they get away with doing pretty much nothing. Everything has to be approved by Chris, so in order for anything to get done it takes twice as long or doesn't happen at all. Promises made to the community are continuously never met, or pushed back, or ""coming soon""
Poorly paid, too physically demanding for me personally to be paid that low.
Don't allow you to have facial piercings
can be fast paced and overwhelming if your team is not all on the same page
The menu changes were too frequent
Very busy most of the time. People are hangry. General food service cons.
You will not take breaks at all, need to be fast on feet, you cannot sit down.
it was a little unorganized
Hot and it could use more ac
Manager is a control freak psychopath who bullied and screamed at everyone all the time. Half the staff quit because of her.
The negatives outweigh the one positive . We were always short staffed because the owner never wanted to schedule more than 2 people per shift. As a result, we were consistently overworked. On top of that, we were underpaid. I was bumped up 25 cents after working there for many years and being the longest tenured employee.
Always go home with flour all over you
Not nuff people who are willing to clean up
Staffing is terrible. Especially on busy nights
poor pay, little to no break periods
The competitions, the pay, the workload, the customers. You can't keep your boss,The customers and your crew happy. You will drive yourself insane and what life is that? They lie to your face saying they appreciate all you do but in reality it's never enough.
Impatient customers, not enough employees, high expectations
The company only offers part time to team member employees

* Can be a toxic environment depending on the manager and co-manager * For whatever reason they tend to go through managers fast and upper management often feels disconnected from reality.
A lot of playing going on Easy job when you know what you’re doing and wasn’t thrown to the wolves. Lots of drama No respect given to you if you’re older and I’m easy to work with.
It was fine until we got anew manager that was rude
Dealing with rude customrers and very hot working conditions

Can be exhausting like most jobs. Customers complain about something you’d never consider til they did
Sauce gets all over my apron. I can never get the sauce off! I have nightmares about it sometimes

Same as above no pros only cons
No breaks, rude entitled customers, lazy coworkers who talk behind your back, no bonus, always want extra help for nothing.
late nights on weekends, customers
A lot weekends Can be short staffed
Those people won't help you.
Minimum pay of 7.25 & never got a raise and some favoritism

Management weren't always the best
Short breaks are my only complaint.
- Understaffed - Very tedious and fast
Just because you get a higher title doesn’t mean anything. Most managers are males, so I would call them sexist because they don’t believe that a female can actually do work. Big Bosses dont care about what you’re going through or how you feel. They just want you to make more money for them. Male managers tend to not do anything as they see themselves as a superior so they will make more money but work 4 hours a day because they are on salary and dont want to have to work that overtime if it doesn’t benefit them.
- Everything is at your manager's discretion. Hours you work, the work you do, days off with or without using your PTO, everything. Too much power is given to middle management and there are not enough actual guidelines for them to follow. Some managers take this in stride and treat you like a person. Others see it as a constant power struggle. - Raises/bonuses are granted to those with extremely high performance reviews so if your manager doesn't like you and knocks you down a point at every turn, it doesn't matter what the quality of your work is at the end of the day. You will not be compensated fairly unless you're best friends. - Any sort of new idea needs to be run by the right person or else you have to make it sound like it was their idea. Also anything that would cost them money to implement will not be considered 99% of the time. - Training. Even if your manager approves it, if you aren't actively working while you're supposed to be paying attention to training you'll be punished for it.
The people who work there
Low pay and high stress
You'll rarely get your tips unless you work the register. Employees with the flu are forced to come in anyway despite having to take breaks to vomit. You must choose team calls-out-every-shift or team fills-in-for-every-shift, and if you choose the latter you will remain employed and be working open to close with one to three other employees. Management loves to not show up to their shifts and stalk everyone on their cameras. Nobody has a food permit, and they don't wash their dishes with soap because it ""wastes time.""
Too much stress for what is paid, yes it is 15 an hr, getting 40 hours. Overtime is frowned upon. Its just not a livable wage for all the work that needs to be done on a daily basis. 50 hours for co manager. Im the closing manager and leave late every night. Its just not and ideal job to get. I do not reccomended anyone work here.
bad pay bad management annoying coworkers rude customers dirty store long hours w small breaks
Sauce gets all over my apron. I can never get the sauce off! I have nightmares about it sometimes
Horrible management and they don’t care
The store needs a lot of tlc
The pay could be a little higher.
Giving a raise. Since I had turned 16 I wanted an up to my check.
Sometimes it gets a little slow
Boss plays favorites with everyone except the ones she doesn't like
There are no cons at this company.
It has some hard working hours
because its cheap and fast it's not the best.
No breaks, rude entitled customers, lazy coworkers who talk behind your back, no bonus, always want extra help for nothing.
Those people won't help you.
This store in particular only hires female for front of house and it can cause drama sometimes
Something’s could be altered to make it better. To get manager it takes at least a year to get thought as one, and five months to train.
Just because you get a higher title doesn’t mean anything. Most managers are males, so I would call them sexist because they don’t believe that a female can actually do work. Big Bosses dont care about what you’re going through or how you feel. They just want you to make more money for them. Male managers tend to not do anything as they see themselves as a superior so they will make more money but work 4 hours a day because they are on salary and dont want to have to work that overtime if it doesn’t benefit them.
- Everything is at your manager's discretion. Hours you work, the work you do, days off with or without using your PTO, everything. Too much power is given to middle management and there are not enough actual guidelines for them to follow. Some managers take this in stride and treat you like a person. Others see it as a constant power struggle. - Raises/bonuses are granted to those with extremely high performance reviews so if your manager doesn't like you and knocks you down a point at every turn, it doesn't matter what the quality of your work is at the end of the day. You will not be compensated fairly unless you're best friends. - Any sort of new idea needs to be run by the right person or else you have to make it sound like it was their idea. Also anything that would cost them money to implement will not be considered 99% of the time. - Training. Even if your manager approves it, if you aren't actively working while you're supposed to be paying attention to training you'll be punished for it.
low pay understaffed depends on franchisee
Low pay and high stress
You'll rarely get your tips unless you work the register. Employees with the flu are forced to come in anyway despite having to take breaks to vomit. You must choose team calls-out-every-shift or team fills-in-for-every-shift, and if you choose the latter you will remain employed and be working open to close with one to three other employees. Management loves to not show up to their shifts and stalk everyone on their cameras. Nobody has a food permit, and they don't wash their dishes with soap because it ""wastes time.""
The worst customers I have ever had to deal with.
Raises were only handed out to the guys that worked there
Rude customers and barely any prep on the weekends at times when it's super busy.
management isn’t the best and customers are rude
Pay vs workload didn’t match
Can be a stressful environment at times
procastination and communication are two things i feel as a group we should all work on but it takes the entire team not just a few of us
As stressful as any other restaurant position, get past that and you will do just fine.
Mangement nonexistence New management Depending on the day customers
Lots of demand on your time for little pay

","Late nights are necessary for management positions.
They were bought out, took away a ton of perks and gave everyone a pay cut.
Some late nights depending on shift.
Can only work part-time. Full-time is only for management/team lead.
The company hates individuality. They train and act like a cult. Management will harass and put you down so fast. 30 steps forward they will knock you 50 steps back. If depression, anxiety, and alcoholism is what you are looking for this is the job for you!
we had no vacation pay.
Working weekends, evenings, and holidays (not all). Not a lot of Regal theaters around my area for growth/transfer opportunites.
toxic work environment, inconsistent hours, bad management
+ Closing shifts typically are until 2AM-3AM + Blockbuster movies create busy shifts + Hours can be cut drastically during slow months
Will take advantage of you if you can close.
Management wasnt great and low pay
Low wage, dirty work environments (now, butter is self-serving, but before, workers had to place butter on the popcorn and it was very very messy by the end of the shift).
Working here is tiring too
The customers are terrible, your car runs the risk of being broken into every time you park, parking is ridiculously expensive
Sort of late or long shifts sometimes, holiday work often required / unavoidable
dealing with people especially near LBI during the summer very strict about phone use and being distracted ""if you have time to lean you have time to clean
Terrible hours and terrible management.
Work Schedule Lack of opportunity for advancement
The management is terrible, the people that are there to work are few and far in between. Cleaning is a whole task because no one does a good job so it’s so much harder to get anything done. If you are a good worker then all the work gets thrown on you and no upper management has good communication skills so you get told to do 6 different things at the same time.
I would just say the amount of time you're standing and cleaning theaters is a lot.
Most ppl got to work weekends If you work anyday besides weekends its gonna be dead Lots and lots of old people come in
- Working late nights, weekends
Call outs Management Toxic work environment

Low Pay Terrible hours Subpar Management
Only way to move up is in full time positions Favoritism
The general managers will micro-manage, power-trip, violate labor laws, etc. So many roof tiles fell, and they almost hit 2 employees on their shift, and have done nothing to fix it. General managers are actively looking at cameras to get employees fired, even though they are incredibly understaffed. General managers treat their team leads like crap and the team leads who worked for them had put in their 2 week notice within a few months working there. Racism is common in the workplace, told a team lead about it, and nothing was done about it. Schedule people on days they aren't available, and don't schedule people where they are available. People were scheduled on very important family emergency days, including at a funeral. Paperwork for RDOs are lost and lack of communication on emails.
A lot of their theatres that are not in big cities need updating. A lot of them are old and outdated.
Be ready to do the job of three others, and upsell upsell. If a rush comes, be prepared for the manager to hide in their office. Coworkers are too busy talking about their drama.
Do not depend on all your hours. Massive cutting.
The manager is creepy, he like to talk about how often he watches his employees on the camera and talks about their uniforms in an uncomfortable way. The older staff is really quick to bully and boss around younger and newer people, they’re on some sort of power trip. Pay sucks for the work we do. A lot of (negative) talking behind peoples back, overall just a toxic environment that I would not recommend. Manger caused me to have a panic attack. Some coworkers will purposely not let you in so you clock in late. Plus the assistant manager makes racist remarks and some of the team leads get in on the bullying of newer people.
Hard to get good hours.
It was terrible when MCU movies were super popular though. Influx made everything worse
The HR team takes any accusation of misconduct very seriously.
Switched to Pepsi products and should go back to coca cola
None there are no cons
management is horrible, not very competitive salary
Weekends are not an option usually
Low wages compared to industry standards
Only way to move up is in full time positions Favoritism
Extremely long hours and late nights, ridiculous schedules, and horrible management. This company wants you to sell their unlimited program and get guests to donate but won't schedule properly so that you spend half your night dealing with angry guests. There is way too much responsibility for what you're paid and the amount of audits they do is baffling, probably just trying to cover their butts after the bankruptcy.
Regal demands certain standards that we couldn't do, and we were penalized for it
I worked there in total for a long time. I worked full time while I was also in school full time. I worked so hard and was a good employee and they fired me because of another person's inappropriate actions. FL being an at will state basically means there is nothing you can do and contacting HR would just get your hopes up. They are harsh and quick to implement termination despite the employees side and the fact that they could have no write ups. They don't believe in second chances but somehow allow some of the worst employees to continue working with maybe a write up (I've seen it happen multiple times) . I don't believe they actually care about their employees no matter how much you show you actually wanted the job. I've seen managers do the worst and depending on their relations with the higher ups they end up fine. I myself loved that job and my co workers, but after this experience I've been so easily kicked to the curb and now have no means of survival and off to the unemployment office I go. Going into any Regal now is traumatic for me and I end up crying. I recommend anything else. Put your mental help first.
uniform code strict to a t, as if im in bootcamp or something. crazy hours, you could get out at midnight one night and 3am the next night.

Bad Management at the theatre
Work weekends, managers, rude customers
Favoritism by cast members and management. Coworkers have high egos and are incompetent lazy and disrespectful and have no skills workwise or education wise or social wise. Also minority employees face hostile treatment and do not receive promotions and disrespect by coworkers. Also poor pay
Not enough hours for everyone

- Busy days can be stressful
Very Strict rules Medical leave (Provided With a doctor's note) is still questionable. Depends on the FMLA Act. Managers/Team Leaders will sometimes ask you to personally find someone to fill in for you for that leave instead of emailing everyone like they normally would. Even with 2 days of prior notice. No actual official way to contact other employees to fill in your leave for you.

It pay little with trash management
Minimum wage and late night shift for closer.
Pay is below market value.
Only con is some of the crazy people you might encounter coming in to watch a movie
Inconsistent business, can be boring
Corporate doesn't care about the theatres or their staff unless numbers are bad. ""Raises"" were by the cent. Barely any time between showings to clean Corporate always took a customer's side, even when they were abusive
Manage can be a little strict
Management would always gossip about workers and they believe whatever rumors are spreading.
Small break room & no security
Weekends and busy busy days
dirty and gross rude customers sometimes

Some of the processes needed fixing
Typical desi politics and work environment
Did not like my confrontational personality
Slow project allocation and really bad HR
Very long appraisal time period and they wont release comments and report on time.
Favoritism is constantly shown from management even at the project’s expense.
I would suggest do not join company if you are experienced
More M&A will help Hexaware
Not much Employees benefits like PTO, PF
Nothing to share as cons
Language barrier, must find work for overseas people.
fake promises during interviews prefer only South Indians if you still survive all they start asking client for firing you through client They pay less in comparison to market for SAP consultants They have wrong attitude towards female leads/managers or any other female in the team specially if she is North Indian Working hours have no limit they expect you to work for them 24/7 and if you against them they don’t give you anyone to help Fake projects and positions to hire female employees for taking out stress on them Commenting on female employees None of the client gives them good profile they just do any role for money and market showing fake positions Even AVPs are testers for clients here No knowledge base of employees just depending upon working sessions with clients to survive
no feeling of company as the onsite teams are small and disconnected from the US leadership team
Poor internal management Less pay, No Paternity leave.
faced no cons so far
Gender Discrimination and there is no one in full time HR or management to listen or solve your issues after you complain multiple times or ask/solve rather they will Fire You according to there convenience
low salary pressing mgmt. micromanagement
Worst place to work, you will gets replaced by untrained employee without notice in fact they will asked to train them for your position.
no much benefits and 401k match
- The company will lie in your separation letter so they don't have to pay unemployment. - They will underbid contracts and leave you to struggle to meet their outrageous commitments. - The HQ staff in India treat Americans (US and Mexicans on visas) as second-class employees, voice how much they don't like Americans and call you Indian profanities in the background of conference calls. - Work/Life Balance.... (what's that?)
Less salary. No salary revision
Salary , growth opportunity , g , g
Liars and paid much less than they promised, took out from us the benefits promised and bad treatments and racism.
Slow growth for long term employees
A little complicated structure in terms of organization.
Growth, Compensation, Job rotation, No Bonus or Profit sharing
Don't give competitive salary in compare to other companies
Lack of leadership across some verticals
There is noo increase in pay even after working so hard
I don't have any cons
Reporting managers don't have direct oversight of your work (mostly you work under client project managers directly) and company basically have not much idea about your situation/progress/performance. Mismanagement of visa/green card applications. Numerous employees on verge of losing projects or having to move back to India because visa processes were delayed at whim of managers.
Cronyism , inexperienced leadership, Micromanaged. Racist
Client focused. Voices might not get heard sometimes
Salary is not at par with industry standards
Only 10 personal days & very bad 401k match

Less Salary Hike No Vertical Growth
Low salary and that’s it to add

not great for new opportunities
I don't have any cons.

Pay is good, quarterly bonuses are usually paid, drivers are outstanding, and insurance is not bad.
The management and employees were great. Room to move up if you work hard but the pay is significantly less than comparable positions with the nearby Walmart headquarters (both employees & managers were constantly trying to move from JB Hunt to Walmart).

Easy job. Drop and hook
Predictable routes and pay with northeast regional account
I honestly can’t think of much, other than it was a Fortune 500 company on the resume, and it paid the bills (well - barely). I guess I could say its stock performed well during my time there too, and overall a very financially sound company.
Having a good work environment is fundamental in determining whether or not you'll like your job. We have a great work environment, I have a great schedule, the job is pretty easy, love the people I work with.
Had no shortage of work. I learned about time management and finishing work I said I would finish in the time frame I said. I felt respected and productive as a helpful participant to the job.
Decent starting salary, some chances for training.
Good management and training opportunities.
Highly safety oriented. Decent benefits package at a reasonable cost.
Not too stressful. Everyone is so nice. Work is generally engaging. Overall tech stack is pretty modern, so the chances are low that you'll be dealing with super legacy code bases. The summer internship is a blast, with several outings. The management running the intern program have your back and will always support you when needed. Employment is full time for the summer and part time during the semester (if offered to stay). Pay is increased based off college year (junior, senior etc). Management prioritizes academic needs and will accommodate your needs during midterms.
A Very safety oriented company
The people were pretty nice
JB Hunt has a healthy culture and a commitment against laying off prefering instead to invest and reorganize when in bust towards a spring loaded boom when conditions reverse.
lots of experience with a reputable company
Weekly pay, off on weekends
People are great and they are willing to help, even if they are not in your team. Lots of opportunity to grow and move up.
Great company to work for. They treat you as one big family.
* Multiple Shift Options * Talented colleagues * Access to outside training resources * Benefits
My account has a small company feel. I have good management. They never micro manage us. We have new trucks. We have our own trucks. The job is easy. We don’t touch freight and don’t have a night shift. It’s easy to get time off when needed. We get paid hourly and over time over 40 hours. Usually work 8-10 hour days and average about 50 hours a week so work life balance is decent.
Great benefits package within the company.
Lots of resources available to help you
This job is ideal for someone looking to gain experience in the field of business management and administration. You have the potential to gain many skills and further your berth of knowledge.
Very diverse by the tech industry's standards. Also there's a ping pong table, and sometimes we get donuts. Depending on where you land, the work-life balance is pretty great on most teams. Other teams, it's hellish.
You won’t be fired ever
Consistent work/pay Opportunity to move to a different account like a new job within the job when available.
If you enjoy working as part of a team , JB Hunt has great team dynamics! And bonus it’s an amazing growth minded company always looking to grow their employees.

Great people, family centered environment. Good benefits. In good years bonuses are good.
Great coworkers (most of them), a friendly environment overall, lots of different tech stacks to learn (some are not super up-to-date though, still have some legacy applications that need migrating), decent pay. But your experience could really depend on the manager you get.

","Drivers are absolutely out of control
Safety culture is designed for drivers to fail, for yearly bonuses due to all the ridiculous hurdles and upper management not listening to drivers. Drivers are forced out in bad weather and if an accident/incident happens, the company will not back them, but let them go and take safety bonus money. There is a lack of diversity in upper management/corporate and seems like there will be no change in the near future. Upper Management is lacking sensitivity and refuse to listen to drivers/managers but set up pointless meetings promising change, but nothing ever happens. If you decide to leave company, make sure to use all your pto first because company will not payout and give a bad referral to future employer(I have proof of that). PTO policy is terrible! Nobody is never left go early or off when work is extremely slow but force to use pto time. Constance harassing and putting drivers out of service for pointless training and meetings. Pay is constantly being refused by payroll and needs to be revisited by Transportation Managers II. Far too many Chiefs and not enough Indians, trying to prove somebody wrong and emailing upper management to make you look bad. No type of structure and leadership is bad! Constance fighting between departments that are aired out in emails and nothing is done about it. Maybe a good company, but the Harrisburg, Pa., Terminal is not! That is why turnover is 40 percent. Better to look elsewhere, where you can be respected and appreciated.
I liked the people but the company itself is criminal in their treatment of customers. I watched them yank reviews off line in a matter of minutes after customers reported damages caused by the company for faulty installations or delivery mishaps. I suppose the same could probably be said for nearly all fortune 500 companies.
Raises are bad Bonuses aren't guaranteed Environment is awful. People constantly playing terrible music all day on speaker. All day from morning until 5pm. Open floor plan so it’s loud and hard to hear anything. Most of the people are grumpy, hate their jobs, and are dead inside. The customers aren’t nearly as bad as some of the people you have to work with. This should be hybrid or fully remote position. There’s no in person meetings or collaborations with anyone. They pile everyone in close together. No personal space. It’s awful. Bathrooms are gross. Sometimes it smells like sewage in the stairwell. Not enough tables in break room Hard to move up without a connection. Start networking if you want to go anywhere in this company. Walking 10 min to get from car to desk. Parking is awful.
terrible training, hours behind the computer, should just be a remote job
Very nice company, I should come back for for them
not as competitive pay as other companies
Poor pay and benefits. It’s hard to move up because of this new program and the benefits are expensive
Long work hours, a bit boring.
horrible PTO accrual rate, no work from home flexibility, leadership is gossipy and micromanage. don't feel like i can be myself here at all. all about the money here
Driver is faulty for all incidents
On your own and make ur own decisions, pto is shared with sick time.
Your position with company can be short lived depending on which account you start with. Job security is there but limited.
Not enough pay. $5 to $11 less than other companies doing same thing.
starting off pto is accrued
Long hours, minimal holidays off, poor work life balance.
Changing expectations constantly so sometimes left in question of whats needed to be done
You can't fire toxic drivers and once they know that, it becomes a hostile environment. Very toxic work place once that happens
Slow trucks, driver facing camera
Less pay than other places Remote work seems to be dying out
Local trucks run to slow 62 mph. And the trucks are cut back so far even when empty the trucks have problems climbing small hills.

the poor management that turns over and causes turniver. toxic managers incapable of managing, and incapable of performing the work of their employees. exceptional work is ignored, average or poorer work is treated with hostility Employer claims to market as an emploer of Veterans... they dont give any employee Veteran's Day off ironically. in fact, the appear to enjoy firing older folks and Veterans even more. With every new manager change comes a random policy change that negatively impacts ppl & morale. They are known to ""target"" employees with hostility for various reason, attempting to coerce them to quit, to avoid finsncoal liability. Routinely violate employment rights & equal treatment, including their own agreements. Animus is evident towards, women, minorities & lgbtq employees.

So much micromanaging. Your manager is micromanaging you, other managers are micromanaging your managers. There is always someone watching ready for you to fail so that they can stick it to you. There is an environment of “mean girls” that is extremely clique-ish and feels reminiscent to high school. It is not a healthy environment to feel supported and educated. It feels like you are thrown into the wolves and expected to know every in and out of the company with no proper training. You’re working the full 8-5 daily hours but they don’t even give you near enough work to fill those hours. I’ve never felt more isolated, judged, watched, and unrecognized.
The trucks are governed too low
Heavy labor can wear out your body
Manual labor, you do unload
Micro management looks over you
Young inexperienced management. Dispatch has the same problem.
Shortage of empty trailers, lack of transparency of drivers and dispatchers job roles and responsibilities
Work environment, lack of opportunities, lack of training in relevant/market skills, no real HR structure when it came down to it. … On balance, this experience was not altogether different from most jobs at the company/in the industry.
Literally the only negative thing I can think of is the pay
Wasn’t as much onboarding as I would have liked. Not as many recourses for help to learning as desired.
Middle management, poor oversight of dedicated accounts, racism, favoritism, retaliatory culture, unequal treatment in the workplace, connections mean more than achievements, HR department is a joke, don't make any waves they will get rid of you.
Long hours and difficult schedules.
Communication could be a bit better but could vary by location.
Compensation is on the lower end for the industry. High performing employees might consider seeking a more rewarding wage elsewhere (unfortunately this is already happening). LGBT related emails (PLUS+ ERG) are inappropriate and should be discontinued. Those topics should not be expected from a transportation company in central USA.
Long days, weather, traffic, some customers
Horrible equipment, no regular maintenance
Is phasing out remote work
bosses put a lot of work off on you
Nothing extra for outstanding performances and no kind of raises.
Don’t really have any cons
Pay needs to be higher especially with cost of living in California
* Hostile work environment * Discriminatory practices against women and POC * Non-Transparent promotional paths * Favoritism of rule enforcement.
We have driver facing cameras now. Pay could be better. There are no annual pay raises or opportunities for growth. Work 6 days a week regularly.
Pay is not very competitive compared to other roles in Logistics, only transportation.
Hard to get started with other forms of pay
This position can be very stressful and demanding of your time.
Stack ranking, things like establishing a long-time bonus plan only to change the plan the week we were supposed to receive our Q1 bonus (resulting in some of us not receiving one, while others received 10% of what was originally promised), only 2 weeks of PTO until 5 years with the company, then it moves to 3 weeks, non-competitive pay, among many other things related to the business' perspective on the value of their technology organization.
Bonus is not based on your performance. If the drivers get in to accidents you won’t get a bonus. They don’t promote on experience. Only promotions are given to people who will move to the middle of nowhere
Shiesty, gas lighting management Boys club
With a growing campus, there will soon be a traffic congestion issue, if/when you travel to corporate.
DEI and future vision of the workforce
Work life balance Lack of training/ communication
Pay is not up to national standards, drivers don't understand when an issue is a warehouse vs manager caused issue, drivers take out frustrations on managers, drivers dont understand managers work/life balance and want them to answer 24/7, even on days off. Progression for moving up is slow. Rat race to the top and you sit on an account at Transportation Manager doing the work of a Manager 1 or 2.
Some days can be tough

Middle management, poor oversight of dedicated accounts, racism, favoritism, retaliatory culture, unequal treatment in the workplace, connections mean more than achievements, HR department is a joke, don't make any waves they will get rid of you.
Weakened market conditions mean delayed promotions.
Like I mentioned, really depends on your manager, things could look really different. There is definitely a hierarchy and lots of politics. Can get stressful at times, old codes from legacy app can be really annoying as the users still use both that and the new system. The pay doesn't reflect the amount of work sometimes. There's a pattern of promoting and praising workaholics (at my team personally, I have heard it's not the same for at least 1 other team)
long shifts and weekend shiifts required
None I can think of
Horrible equipment, no regular maintenance
Not much of a work-life balance
Bad dispatcher and management department
bottleneck within the intermodal promotion availabiliy
Paychecks up and down so far
There are no cons at JB Hunt.
Highly political atmosphere. Nepotism. Inconsistent application of policies.
Hard to move up the ladder
bosses put a lot of work off on you
Touch freight Tight areas A lot of backing
lots of work, hours can be long
Nothing extra for outstanding performances and no kind of raises.
Always on time with love

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Reviews-E12777.htm,"- networking - good work - valuable feedback
Wonderful coworkers and talented artists and designers. The franchise IPs WB maintains provide a large selection of projects to work with that really tug on the heart strings of nostalgia. This company has many loyal and very creative employees.
The brand itself has an allure, one of the few original studios with an immense history in film, which does look good on a resume (we'll see how long that lasts). Getting to work on some of the content is also a wonderful experience.
Back when we were Turner, there was a very strong legacy and a very family-oriented culture. There were endless opportunities to explore new ideas, technologies and challenges. You were encouraged to take risks.
Some flexibility, amazing, award winning content from Warner Bros. and legacy WarnerMedia.
Remote Work Options: The company's flexibility in offering remote work options, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, allows for a better work-life balance and eliminates the need for long commutes. Positive Work Environment: Employees often find the workplace to be welcoming, and the colleagues are generally friendly and cooperative, making it a pleasant place to work. Decent Compensation: The company offers a somewhat competitive salary Decent Benefits: Warner Bros. Discovery's benefits package, which includes health insurance, retirement plans, and other perks, contributes to a stable and secure work experience. Life Work Balance: Not as much crunch as other studios
Good salary and benefits Some great projects

I have been with this company for 20 years. Before it was Warner Bros Discovery the list here would be long... Now there are no Pros unless you enjoy fearing that your going to loose your job each day, and enjoy having to lay good people off on a regular basis.

Great people to work with in the Knoxville office.
Access to other divisions, so great position to learn a wide array of fields.

This is a fantastic place to intern - there is a robust internship program complete with networking opportunities and dedicated time to meet with various members of your team. Everyone is kind and wants to see you make the most of your internship.
Great management, environment, and flexibility
Great company, works was fun, great coworkers
fast paced, efficient, demanding, caring, casual
good colleagues and flexible hours
Powerfull content. Easy to bargain with clients. Fair compensation
Probably one of the nicest group of people I've worked with over my career. Most people try to be helpful, and I experienced very few issues when it came to problem solving among the troops. The lower executives I was exposed to were nice as well. They seemed to care about their teams. Compensation and benefits were strong, too. And HR tried to establish some solid DEI initiatives, but they largely fell apart without any sustained support from senior mgmt.
Great perks, recognition and rewards. Amazing opportunity for those that can motivate and direct self, and aren't afraid to engage and build a social and business network independently.
Great 401k. Cool place to work, though less than it used to be. Still has powerful brands and great exposure. Nature of the work remains some of the best.
Good perks but low morale
Great, passionate colleagues and interesting content, at least till the content is killed.
Good managers who know how to give feedback
Biggest library in the industry. Fresh content.
HBO as a streaming platform provides great if not the best content which is loved by an increasing subscriber base, though renaming to MAX is nothing but a joke.
Overall great company to work at. I’m a legacy HBO employee and have enjoyed the numerous perks of working at this great entertainment company. If you enjoy entertainment, want to learn and make a decent salary, come and stay for a year or two.
Legacy Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, and Turner content and studio culture was amazing. Very loyal and proud employee base.
The pay is above average.
Great Company to work for
Great brands (for now) Legacy WarnerMedia team is awesome, also some great people on the legacy Discovery side Learned a ton working here, though most of it was from people who are no longer at the company due to the ""merger""

- Positive work environment - Great teams - Good exposure into the entertainment industry
Promotion opportunities are lesser. Great place to work
","- no full time offers given
Underpaid and overworked by the cooperate culture. It was hard to find time for a life working this job. I had to put in a ton of unpaid overtime and it really ruined a lot of the joy of working here. The promise of career advancement was taken away almost immediately after I signed my contract and I felt very bait and switched. I was constantly relied upon to clean up far too many mistakes made by my coworkers and amplified by my managers. I was then not given the pay or the promotions I deserved while I was forced to do the job and expected to maintain results that other more senior managers were completely incapable of delivering on.
Previously, Warner Bros. was a great company to work for, but from the minute David Zaslav took over the company has become a dumpster fire. Cuts are often, with little understanding of what departments are working on and what the roles being cut do. Everyone, from the top down, lives in fear as to who is next on the chopping block. If you are one of the ""lucky"" ones that aren't cut, it simply means that your workload will quadruple, but don't worry, they will be another round of layoffs just a few months later, so any relief you might feel in the immediate will be gone soon enough. If you are looking for a stable work environment where your work is appreciated, this ain't it. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy.
After the 2018 acquisition, the culture began to erode and it became more corporate. Seemed there was less focus on employees and risk-taking. Also, all of the focus went to HBO Max, which left many of the brands in the lurch.
Toxic culture now with Discovery ""merger,"" that was not really a merger rather a total take-over. WarnerMedia had it's problems (largely debt), but overall the culture was compassionate, transparent, and encouraged creativity and trust. Discovery brought its harsh communication style or total lack of comms, bottom-line centric style, robotic, non-emotional and non-human approach to management. The more egotistic and focus on one's own career growth to get ahead at no matter the cost is what seems to be rewarded.
Limited Growth Opportunities: One of the primary downsides of working at Warner Bros. Discovery is the limited growth and advancement opportunities. Bureaucracy: Like many large corporations, the company may suffer from bureaucracy, which can slow down decision-making processes and hinder efficiency.
Most of the creatives are white men. No efforts to add diversity in the mix. Lots of lip service and fake promises during BLM/Summer 2020. When there were layoffs recently due to the merger, our group laid off mostly people of color when there were not many to begin with.
At times the job can lack managerial direction.
- Since merger have not had the best experience, less retention.
Constant mergers and cuts and HR was weird
Discovery took over and absolutely ruined the culture. They have an archaic mindset. It’s a totally different place to work now. They don’t have competitive pay and are laying people off left and right.
Absolutely no growth in this department. They’ve completely destroyed the teams that support the lifestyle and entertainment networks. The workload was becoming unmanageable, as they just keep depleting the department by laying people off. This leads to a terrible work environment.
Layoffs, low salary, not suprotive
employees are overworked and as more and more people leave the company or are let go but the company refuses to back fill their positions and the remaining employees are left with more work every time.
Sometimes gets hectic and a fear of layoffs is always there
-CEO is out of touch -Not a ton of upward mobility at mid-level
We had a hybrid setup but the 3 days we were in the office felt pointless bc we were still on zooms. New management came in, cut budgets, and cleaned house.
C-Suite and top level managers into the merger didn't really understand what they bought and spent more time talking down all the crap things the old leadership did. Very confrontational approach to things, and making fast decisions with limited context included.
Senior Leadership takes all the money for their greedy pay but has no idea how to run the company Managers are left to try to accomplish impossible goals without the resources to even come close. The hours or horrible if you want to have a personal life, be prepared to work 80 - 90 hour weeks with no support or understanding of your family life. Also be prepared to be forced to the office 5 days a week for no reason which is wonderful after working until 2AM. Be prepared for a meager pay which is well below industry standards for any role. I think you wold be better off working in a Chinese sweat shop than at Warner Bros Discovery
….merger after merger. First it was AT&T that tried to shake things up and make WB a techie company without remembering that we are a MEDIA COMPANY FIRST. Then, in 2022, we were bought out by Discovery which really changed WB for the worse. Company culture, work life balance, hybrid work model, you name it - it all went downhill once Discovery took over. I definitely felt like an important asset to the company when I first started working there years ago, which sadly shifted to a profit-first and employee-last model gradually over time.
unorganized Ad Sales structure, understaffed

Lots of layoffs happening Feels unsteady at times Not a lot of room to move up unless you want to be involved in the politics Pay isn’t that great

There is no chance to be promoted, less chance to get your salary adjusted for performance and layoffs are always looming.

There were so far no cons about the company at all
The media landscape is rapidly evolving due to changes in consumer habits and technology (i.e, AI, etc). This leaves a sense of uncertainty with employment longevity .
Micromanaging. Can't even go to the bathroom without your manager looking for you.
Specifically for the Tour Department, there is absolutely no room for growth. When you speak up about wrong behavior be prepared to be treated like you are inferior and dumb. Be ready to work long hours for $16 and no benefits, because you will be hired as a part-time temp, but will only get your ""contract"" renewed instead of being offered a permanent position. The lack of communication with all management is embarrassing, and the only way to grow your career is if you flatter and dote on everything they say and do.
Locals and long term employees don't get promoted. Hiring is not always based on skill, more on connections. Mid level managers aren't capable of managing.
Continual mergers and organizational changes
Boasts an impressive lineup of shows, movies, and TV series, providing employees with a captivating creative landscape.

Doing tours in the summer Burbank heat was uncomfortable. Also, upper management had us doing tours and reporting to work when the Burbank mountains caught on fire and there was soot and smoke all over the lot. They cared more about the money which was really heartbreaking!
none that i could think of
The ""I"" culture versus ""We"" culture recently. Lots of politics inside the company
May not be suitable for those that require a lot of structure
Constant mergers/change and layoffs with no future certainty. Salaries are some of the lowest in the fields with compensation increases below or at 3-5% annually. No oversight of managers and direct reports: difficult people are difficult managers and a toxic work environment goes unchecked. No longer any perks for employees other than reduced HBO Max subscription. No attempt to attract and retain excellent workers.
Toxic work culture A ton of overlap in roles across different departments, setting entire departments to butt heads Unbelievable and impossible approval process Lack of diversity and understanding of DEI issues, especially at the mid to upper level of management Marketing team is incredibly antiquated and out of touch Budgets and people have been cut, but workload has not Most of the employees are exhausted and bitter
Too much focus on bottom line
Manager would leave early to go to the gym and leave all of us to work. Would have to write reports so the manager could acted like he was there all the time.
The discovery “merger” has brought a lot of changes with two companies whose cultures couldn’t be more different. You are definitely underpaid if you’re working here. But if you’re happy, why does that matter?
Little room for growth Never ending waves of layoffs Very old school culture
Leadership is telling everyone to leave or expect to be axed at any moment. They work people to mental breakdowns. CEO obviously doesn't care about anything or one but himself. Senior leaders often come across lost, confused or worried as a result. No real culture now that everything is shaken up.
Typical corporate BS. If you are well liked and do well, you will climb the corporate ladder. If not, you won't see much career growth.
David Zaslav absolutely ruin a wonderful, creative place
Must work on-site daily. Always on-call.
I loved it working there. Positive experience over all!
none at all. just a great place to work
- Internship experience can be very different based on what team you intern for- lack of standardization within the program - Many internship events were based in Burbank (CA) offie rather than Culver City which created disconnect among the interns
Not many opportunities to get promoted
Network President is rarely visible to anyone outside the senior staff inner circle. SVPs are deputized to be incredibly mico-manage-y. I often witnessed them creating problems at the expense of their teams just so they could fix them. Very cliquey. Borderline toxic. Almost exclusively straight white women in senior roles. If you fall out of favor with the finicky SVPs, you’re done.
A lot of changes and consistent layoffs
Would've loved more opportunities to be in person!
Constant volatility with layoffs and pressure to be in office
Management didn’t care, worklife balance is horrible
pressure, speed, communication, social, freedom

The ""I"" culture versus ""We"" culture recently. Lots of politics inside the company
There seemed to be little to no vision for the place at all. I was with the company for several years—before Discovery+, through the merger with WB, and onward to the launch of MAX. The entire time I watched so much jockeying and confusion among executives and directors that it became clear that no one was really in charge. No one was settling understandably confusing questions about process and how legacy linear teams should incorporate with newer streaming teams, and it got even worse with the merger. For years I would watch people admit freely—often openly to colleagues and even their managers—that they don't know what their job is supposed to be. In some cases, it was a good place for people to level up considerably—despite having never worked anywhere else or gained the experience to do the jobs they've been given. Nice people, but so many colleagues seemed way out of their depth, and the communication issues revealed just how upside-down the company is.
May not be suitable for those that require a lot of structure
Toxic management culture post-merger. Inability of the legacy companies to actually combine and communicate on issues. Endless queue of yes-men who never challenge outrageous management requests over and over again is causing lost ground everywhere. Schizophrenic pace of work and constant fire drills. Arrogance, gaslighting, and outright lies are quickly becoming the norm. Widespread protection of barely competent or fully incompetent loyalists.
Too much focus on bottom line
Constant shifts in vision, leadership, and management due to merger/acquisitions.
The executives need to stop switching us around
No plan to sustain growth. Preparing for potential sale. Cost cutting across the board.
Leadership shows no respect in meetings and no transparency in decision making process. SLT throws f-bomb in meetings with hundreds of audience. Timeline is aggressive. When projects slipped, leadership did not accept the fact that it was caused by impossible timeline but blamed engineering teams did not do their job.
After surviving two mergers, the company’s direction has shifted and it’s lost that family feel. Like many other companies, you are expected to do more with less. Promotions are not easy to come by and pay is not competitive compared to the actual work responsibilities. Most employees work above and beyond their job description but are not compensated. Not a terrible company, but not the best culture either. Seems like we’ve taken a step back in DEI instead of progressing.
Discovery administration took over and gutted company.
The pay isn’t enough for the BS you need to put up with. Dog eat dog. I can run a political campaign after working here. Major cut backs, no one cares about quality. No work life balance. Culture is a joke. Way too many managers. You’ll never move up. You get promised promotions and they never come. The list goes on.
I loved it working there. Positive experience over all!
""Merger"" of Warner and Discovery was hostile takeover dressed up like merger. Discovery getting control of combined company is akin to Michelin star restaurant handing keys over to the folks at McDonald's. Cost cutting measures went too far - and are somewhat of a joke when CEO takes home 9 figures. Teams are overworked - and revenue goals are far out of reach (my guess is this is a cost-cutting tactic so they won't have to pay the sales folks) CEO is megalomaniac who thinks he is Jack Welch - he's more like an unhinged Frank Costanza (see his BU graduation speech debacle). This trickles down and creates a fear-based culture where you have to be looking over your shoulder all day - which is a far cry from the super collaborative culture that was in place at Warner Media pre ""merger"" (when leadership actually cared about the opinions of the rank and file). Common sense and logic have no place at the combined company. My inclination is they are going to be too cheap to renew the NBA deal at the price those rights will command, which will be yet another morale crusher internally. Most employees are not happy, but are too scared to voice their concerns because the job market is not great right now. Per the terms of the AT&T deal, they are allowed to start selling off assets in 2024. My guess is that the brands where you have to spend money to make money (CNN and HBO) are going to get sold off. Discovery's bread and butter is cheap reality content that doesn't cost a lot to make and can be packaged with more desirable content for advertisers. Gone are the days when the leadership cared about relationships with the ad market - they will continue to make it more difficult for clients to do business with them (forcing clients to buy things that don't make sense by bundling, cutting the operations teams so that great customer service is no longer possible, eschewing flexibility in deals). They will continue to hemorrhage talent as folks find workplaces with more balance and better leadership. Very few opportunities for advancement, and unless you want to be a forever ""cog"" in the wheel, I would avoid this place at all costs. Too political to be worth it (though to be fair, one could say the same about all media conglomerates).
Not great pay Too many org changes IT support has a strict playbook with very little autonomy
none at all. just a great place to work
The constant sales and mergers of the company have the employees burnt out on changes.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Income-Life-Reviews-E107579.htm,"Job is great if you put the work into it
So many pros here....let's start with: 1) Freedom & flexibility- the ability to be an independent contractor (1099 associate) who can set their own hours, work pace, and income level. 2) Preparation for the future- It is also nice that you can utilize AIL to gain valuable knowledge about sales, marketing, business development, communications and almost any other valuable skill/trait you would normally acquire in a university/college setting before setting out into the professional world. AIL is a great place for people to develop a solid core for what may lie ahead in their future for what they ultimately want to do for the rest of their lives. 3) A fully-vested, Union-protected 10-year renewal plan makes achieving whatever you want to do in life possible- whether it is starting your own business or a non-profit, without taking out huge small business loans. Work hard now- enjoy the financial benefits for the rest of your life. 4) The socialization aspect: from policyholders to co-workers to the random person that opens up the door to you on a daily basis there is never a boring day @ AIL. In short, we get paid to drive, talk, and help educate people on how to be financially literate when it comes to insurance and savings. Also, we get invited to BBQ's, family functions, and many other cool events from our members. It is impossible to work @ AIL and not develop a strong social network as a result of working here! 5) The opportunity to be given recognition and additional responsibilities based on your own results, instead of on tenure or who you know 6) Legitimate 6-figure income reality...I've personally only had 1 year under $100,000 and I took a ton of time off that year. I had never made more than 50,000 per year working 60-70 hours per week in retail prior to AIL. 7) Good Senior Leadership/Mentors: although rare, this company truly some fantastic individuals sitting in high-profile & decision-making positions within the company...many of whom truly live the company's mottos and operating principles to the 'T' 8) Ability to rebound quickly in a financial crisis- whether it happens directly or indirectly to you there a very few professional opportunities where you can go make an extra 10K or so the following month, even if you are not a manager. While money is the root of all evil, it can also help you do great by and support those around when times get tough. As long as someone focuses on the beneficial aspects of the monetary opportunity at AIL they will be in a good place. 9) Running your own business- as long as you are showing results and growth, you can run your own office(s) with nearly absolute autonomy. But, unlike running your own traditional business, you have the support of a Fortune 700 company and its senior leaders when you need it. It's the best of both world's really.
There is about none. Maybe the fact that it's a pyramid scheme and you can get people under you to supple your salary? Otherwise, just off your work alone no one actually makes a living.
None. You are an employee for some top producer's agency, and their only goal is to meet their partner sales goal so they can maintain their income stream. You are just a number expected to buy-in to the company's propaganda and make other people money under the guise of ""protecting families."" LMAO The only families you're protecting are the salespeople's.
There’s a 5% chance you can make quality money off your leads
Flexibility of your schedule. Opportunity to make a lot of money. Possibility of working for a great team.
I have worked for Arias Division for over 12 years. I started out of college, and I was fortunate enough to turn my entry level position into a full time leadership career. This is my career not just a job. I am blessed to have found this career right out of college. The staff with Arias Division are great and make our jobs easier for the day to day work. The culture has always been positive and family oriented. Advancement opportunities are always encouraged. Life-work balance is excellent if you utilize time management skills. If you have a positive attitude,work ethic, along with people skills the potential to have a successful career is very high. I have found from day one of starting my position that the leadership and mentorship has always been accessible anytime they are needed, with an open door policy. We are privileged to have such a great organization within the company to be apart of.
Working at this organization has completely changed my life! There are other reviews that talk about the hours… yes, they are a bit unconventional for someone looking for a corporate 9am-5pm job but for those who have ever worked retail it’s the same hours but weekends and holidays are off. And, it pays better! The systems are easy enough for individuals who are coachable and determined to learn and there has always been someone to answer my questions and provide the support needed to understand and grow into a better representative. Working on commission was definitely a change for me (and a scary one at that) but with the training provided I was able to quickly put my fear aside, work ethic out front, and make more money that I've ever dreamed I could make! The ability to write my own paycheck and get paid residual income for the rest of my life has completely changed my outlook on commission! If you’re confident in your ability to be coachable,  are ok with working in the afternoons during the week, and are looking to make a six figure income while having fun with your coworkers this is definitely a company worth checking out!
No pros to list at all
great bonuses and residuals great potential for rapid advancement
Great atmosphere to work in - everyone helps each other while we are helping others make sure they are protecting their families for the inevitable. Lots of games and rewards, great monetary rewards available to anyone willing to work.
Exceptional Benefits. Monthly renewals. Ability to work remotely. Stock Purchasing program. Leadership development career track. If you’re not afraid of working hard to obtain things you want in life and you’ve always wanted the support and guidance for an awesome career… that’s exactly what you will experience at American Income Life! The environment is filled with high energy and a caring atmosphere. If you’re a grinder or hustler or you have a leadership mindset, I highly recommend a career at American Income Life. The training and support systems they have in place are first-class in the industry. The leadership opportunities are endless and you are evaluated based on your merit. Being able to work remotely and be in charge of my career is an amazing feeling.
Besides the good money and weekly pay oh and remote job.. It is incredibly easy and fail proof. Success is guaranteed with the work you put in, the community is also very close-knit which is something I appreciate most about the job, since others can be very isolating or lonely. On top of everything else… we get free leads. It doesn’t get better than that.
Complete and competitive compensation package. Great detailed training. Work 100% remote! No buying leads!
The best reason to work with American Income is the career fast track process, and the compensation that backs it! Also, lifetime vested renewals are one the best gifts that keep on giving. When it is your time to finaly retire, there is not a certain age or an extended 20-30 process that you have to go through, and when you walk into a new chapter of your life in retirement, you will continue to get paid on all the work that you have done in the past.
Lied to from the start I should have seen the red flags need me toon of this being a 1099 job and was never paid for my time
The people are nice to work with and offer lots of advice.
If you’re looking for a career instead of a job this is the opportunity for you. You have the opportunity to build your own business. We get a lot of help & guidance from leaders who have plenty of experience in this industry. The pay structure is great. The opportunity for advancement is always there. You will grow as an individual & a leader! You can work from home or go into the office, it’s up to you. The culture is great, everybody genuinely wants to see you succeed and grow. If you’re brand new to the industry they will train you properly & put you in a position to succeed. I highly recommend
There is a culture of growth and development within the company, and the team is always supportive. There is no cap to potential in the company, there are always opportunities for advancement.
You can take off time whenever you want. Working from home is nice.
There’s Flexible hours, remote option and“Training”
There are no pros. This is a MLM. Company will sell you on how much you will make. You will not make anything for at least a month, while working 11 hour shifts daily. The people at the top make good money. You will not.
You get paid weekly. Leads provided. Remote
I would say pretty much none. Do not even consider working for this branch in New Albany IN.
Honestly, the people I worked with were the main plus.

I have been with AIL for 12 years. In 12 years my life has changed drastically for the better. No company has provided the opportunity for growth both personally and financially like AIL has. The opportunity has increased exponentially since we converted to being 100% remote working from home. The focus of protecting working class families with needed products provides rewarding personal fulfillment all while being able to provide financially for my family. Working from home has never been more rewarding; especially with the systems and training they provide throughout your career.
I'm the Human resources director at the Rachel Brown Agency of American Income Life. I honestly love my job. I work for a very understanding company that gives me the work/life balance I've looked for in a career. I've worked here for 3 years and have watched so many agents grow and thrive. The opportunity really is unlimited with the different revenue and growth streams they have available to them. I've spoken directly with clients and heard firsthand how much the benefits have helped them, often when they are going through one of the worst times of their life. I'm so thankful for this job and the doors it's opened for me.
They have great training, the team I am apart of does their best to instill belief and knowledge into new agents, training them along the way.
I have always looked for a job that I could not only grow in the company, but also personally. There is no cap on your income. The work you put in, is a reflection on your income. Anyone who is hardworking, honest, & has resilience should be in this business. The managers are there for you every step of the way, they continue to make sure they are pushing you to do your best, & they truly want the best for you!!
Great benefits, Competitive Comissions, Strong support from leadership
Working at American Income Life is an amazing opportunity to do something meaningful. You can be part of a long-standing tradition of protecting generations of families and their futures. You can also get promoted based on growth and performance! Another reason to work here is because everyone is so family oriented. We all treat each other like family not team members, hence why we all get along so well,
Great opportunity to be able to work remotely and help protect working class families while making a great income. AIL gives its reps the tools and support to be able to succeed in the insurance industry even without prior experience. With available leads and training, as well as the best commissions and bonuses in the industry, there's a reason the company is ranked as the Top 50 places to work according to Forbes Magazine.

- training is excellent, though it can vary based on your individual manager - all promotions are from within and based on results. Can not be held back - residual income for life - helping families and meeting new people every day -Your effort determines your success. For me this was a huge Pro, for some it may be a con as you have to have a good work ethic to be successful.

There are quite a bit of pros, however I will say the flexibility of being able to work remotely from anywhere is the biggest one. The ability to grow and promote within leadership is outstanding. The opportunity for limitless income is truly a blessing.

I started with AIL out of highschool & they took time to talk with my mom first too to make sure she understood everything aswell. Family environment. Great role models to look up to mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, financially, and they all spend time with their families and take care of their kids so you can look up to them like me if you plan to be a parent some day like I do.

There are so many pros with this company, from income, advancement, travel/trips, culture and work life balance.
","Not much cons, everyone saying something loves to complain and can't lock in and get sales. Its not the job, its you...
NOTE: Every individual AIL office is franchised and no two are exactly alike in nature...just like a fast-food chain or multiple-location gym. Depending on your SGA (AIL franchise-owner), RGA, MGA, and other upline managers, you may have the above-mentioned freedom & financial opportunities inhibited by several factors including: 1) Micromanagement- many managers treat their associates like W-2 employees in their daily interactions with them and should be reminded of the 6-Point Test for Independent Contractors to help them develop a working relationship that is more true to the nature of their contract. Recommend to do something, but not require them to do something. Small but huge difference between the two. 2) Too heavy of a focus on the scripts- teach your associates the script and it's key components but don't hold back their creativity and interpretation of the presentation- remember, you hired them because they were intelligent beings (I hope)...not script-reciting robots. 3) Mandatory Meetings- yikes, this is a huge legal volcano waiting to bury the SGA's of this company. Recommend attendance and explain why it is important associates are there...and leave it at that. 4) Lack of accountability from senior management- remember, you are not infallible...quit making promises you can't back up and if you fail to uphold your end of the bargain, make it right in whatever way possible! 5) Buddy-buddy system- depending on the SGA, many are very cliquey and develop too tight of an inner-circle where the general attitude becomes very akin to a fanatic cult. Stay true to your standards and guidelines, not to who challenges you the least and edifies the very ground you walk on 6) Chargebacks and selective underwriting- you may actually owe the money back to the company if you submit a policy that does not get issued due to health, even though sometimes the insured met the underwriting guidelines of the field guide you were issued. AIL also does not like to underwrite large policies for some reason. 7) Too many traps in the bonus system- many times as a senior manager I have not earned the bonuses I projected on earning because of the several pitfalls in the bonus system, such as the quality of the downline manager (the manager you are supervising), the fact that your downline managers did not code enough new associates (even though you might have) 8) The Peter-principle- associates are promoted to management positions to rapidly in many SGAships across AIL so they never get a chance to fully grow into their previous role and end up failing miserably at everything. Give junior associates more time to hone their skills before throwing the next task(s) at them. If you want to grow so bad, go do it yourself and stop forcing others to take on your responsibilities.
The hours go on forever. You have to meet with families in the evening. Your paychecks can be deducted if a past customer cancels their policy. You hardly get a paycheck. It's also a 1099 job so taxes will kill you in the end. They try to bribe you and bring you in with the promise of a salary that you can set yourself and hours that you can work yourself. Don't do it! It's a bad job. Maybe if they paid you an hourly rate with smaller compensation, I can see that but no. It's all on your own.
Where to begin? Terrible, impersonable training for a job that protects your trainer's family, not your client's family, despite their best protestations otherwise. Worst of all, Globe Life AIL products are ridiculously overpriced.
Worked on holidays, worked 60+ hours a week, bait and switched people into thinking they’re getting an amber alert system for their kids but trying to get them to buy life insurance, if you don’t make your managers money or recruit people for them then they don’t care about you, you’ll knock on the same family’s door every single year trying to get them to buy more than they can afford, put 90k miles on my car within a year, majority of the people are high-ego guys flexing their money and designer things constantly, frat house offices, you will literally be worked until burnout and if you quit before you make it to the 2 year mark you’ll never see your passive income they always talk about. I completely lost my entire personality with this job and there’s a reason it’s a fully 10-99 company! It’s to cover their butts about literally everything.
High turn over rate for a reason. Long hours for not the best pay. They say you got to grind out the calls and you'll be successful, but I did that. 10 to 12 hour days and I got basic pay for it, sometimes 7 days a week. Had to attend meetings and trainings almost on a daily bases and they weren't paid. They say 1099, but when you don't show up to a call session or to training you get calls and they make comments. You also get micro managed depending on your upper management. And yes, you can easily get promoted, but only because your upper management gets promoted when they promote. Truth is, some people make a lot of money here, most don't. It's worth a shot if you have the time and funds to give yourself a fair shot to see if it's for you. Also, if you do give yourself a shot and you see it's not for you, don't let yourself get bullied by management that you havent been working enough to justify you not making money. I didn't really agree with everything they did, and I'm sure that contributed significantly.
To have a successful lasting career you must posses or build up the skills to have great time management skills, good communication skills, people skills, and be willing to adapt over time as things change. For example during Covid we had to work remote so we all had to update and learn the virtual side in a short time.
Commission isn't for everyone. Some meeting may go later into the evening.
Everything. You must make over 100 calls every single day AND follow scripts for every single call. You WILL be cussed out and sometimes threatened. You are MOT guaranteed to make money because it is 100% commission based. You only make money IF you can get anyone to actually purchase a life insurance policy. Absolutely NOT worth working for this company at all.
commission only approx. $300 to get licensed before able to sell and make money continuously calling same people everyday for months no wonder they don't answer the phone. Don't answer, means no potential sale, no sale means no money.
The only ""con"" would be that in order to be successful, as with any job, you need to put in the effot and the work. But, hey, that's true of any endeavor.
There will be moments of being uncomfortable, but I don't really view that as a con. Being uncomfortable is the norm on the journey to being the best version of yourself.
You have to put a lot of time and effort into yourself individually and the job in the beginning to reach a point were you won’t have to do nearly as much as your skill set improves and as you move forward through leadership. So it’s not really a con since you’re working on bettering yourself while making bank, you just lose a little time
Training not paid, however very fast paced and able to earn quickly if you learn quickly.
I can honestly say that there are no cons in my personal opinion.
Don’t waste your time or energy
You don't paid until you make your first sale. And then you only make a very small percentage of the commission. A pyramid scheme in disguise.
We don’t have an office in every city. You can work from anywhere in Texas remotely though.
The schedule can be a lot to manage at first, definitely come up with a system to manage your own time!
No paid training. Not financial assistance. Nothing in the way of a company actually caring about you. They don't care about you, so make sure you understand that. You get are some phone numbers of people who have no idea what they signed up for. They are not aware that they are going to be called. Most people think they are just getting some free stuff and are shocked when they learn that you are trying to sell them something. The whole sales process is a mess. They ask you to make 1000 - 1500 calls a week, which is impossible unless you don't have a life and just make calls all day every day.
You pay for your licensing course and test and your a captive agent surge company. Although the hours are flexible there are mandatory meetings and workshops every week. 100% commission based and you have to make “250 calls a day to be productive and guarantee a sale” false… the leads are from years ago, cancelled policies = money out of your pocket. Very misleading and time consuming. leads yell at you over the phone, leads from years ago have passed away. it’s mentally draining and a waste of energy and time. When asking for guidance or any one on one it’s just lame quotes like “you got this” “all we do is increase our productivity and see results” the agents that work in office and that have been there the longest live on residuals and a few sales a month. And the mandatory meetings are just to let everyone know who the top producers are and how much money they make… it’s the same names every week… and they sprinkle in some “uplifting quotes”another waste of time.
Everything. Nothing good to say about this company or any agency that sells AIL products. Do not waste your time. Do not invest any of your own money. It is a scam. They will literally hire anyone with a pulse, because most will not make it a month, and never get paid a dime.
Oh goodness where do I start? Micromanaging to the extreme. I was constantly watched like a hawk. Management made a “losers” bracket. Which they thought was encouraging. Yikes. Management would force new hires to get “coded” aka writing your first deal in the business then they won’t help you. I’ve been in many meetings where they would say they would use that agents code business to collect $10,000 worth of lead credits because they felt “the agent just won’t make it 60 days “. During the interview process they force you to sign up for their online study school so they can save your seat. No paid training. You call the leads of your management or your managers favorite agent so they can get presentations and make money on your calls. I should’ve believed the reviews and not moved forward with American income.
They make you pay out of pocket for training materials. But tell you the training is paid up to twn days. And that you need to complete the study materials twenty five percent a day ( it's hundred plus of pages of reading, about twenty videos and a bunch of tests that you have to get a minimum score on. But they don't explain that on the front end. Then they have someone reach out a to tell you to skip the reading and just watch the videos and take the tests. Then you think your done but no then you have to do multiple exam simulators of one hundred to two hundred questions each that you have to score a ninety or above on. And in the meantime they have your helper calling and messaging you about why you're not moving fast enough. So then before spending more money and scheduling my exam I ask a few questions to try and get some clarification on the process and find out where the compensation they told me about is coming in at. I end up talking to the manager that hired me and am told that the hours are now totally different than what I was told in the interview, and the whole thing about the schedule being flexible was untrue. I told them I couldn't work ten to six that I would need to be off closer to four because of my kids. They said that's fine if you can make your calls and meet you're quotas earlier than you can get off earlier, that changed to the only available shift is two to eight for all new hires. If I told you in the interview I could only work till 4 then obviously I can't work until 8. The woman, insinuates I am lying ""because she was there and knows what was said"". I told her I only agreed to taking the job based on the conversation we had about hours and that I only paid for the training after based on what I was told in the interview about hours and flexibility. I asked for the company to reimburse me which seemed unreasonable to her. She said she couldn't make a decision like that and it was above her position. So I asked her to let me know who to contact or to contact them and let me know what was was going to happen. Of course I have not heard anything back, I also reached out to the owner of the agency who ignored me. It's also worth noting that the weekly meeting is just a bunch different people talking about success and using motivational quotes thrown all over the place. Followed up by a closing prayer that turned into an uncomfortable hymn singing session and strange high energy preaching that lasted too long.
If you are thinking of taking this job, it's because you're a hard worker and you want to make money. I took this job for the same reasons, and it seemed to be above board because they described how they got the union leads, and I was told I'd be paid during training. By the time I finished training, I was short on my rent for the month, and I'd been putting in 60-hour weeks. The leads I got as a full agent were for ppl requesting a free app connected to the Amber Alert system, and then I had to pivot to talking to them about life insurance. I was able to get some referrals, but it was a real mixed bag, and a lot of the ppl I got on the line told me they'd already had virtual appts 1-3 months prior. I was lucky; I have a couple of uncles in sales, and one of them knew someone in insurance who was able to talk to me about his company and gave me someone to reach out to. If you're considering this job, make them tell you where the leads are coming from and how many. Make them tell you how many union leads they're going to give you out of the gate, because that's the presentation you get trained on and those are the easiest to close. And have two months' rent and bills budgeted for.
Honestly, I cannot think of any.
There are no cons, the only difficulty is you will be paid based on the value you bring to your clients. For the right person this is the best way to be paid what your worth.
You get what you put into it so you have to be a hard worker
Didn't get any of my own leads for about a month and a half, when I did I received 45 leads half of which were already contacted by other agents (within the past month) and the other half of which has to be fully deceived into believing they're receiving something for free, only to be duped on the appointment when the offer screen pops up. Felt very sleazy, and very slimy to me. Even though I made some money, the commission rates are NOT ALL THE SAME. They advertise 50% commission across the board on the contract, and forget to mention in tiny letters that 50% only applies to ""some"" carriers. I made as little as 20% commission on some sales. Some people are successful in this business, but you really have to BELIEVE in what you are doing, and fully get drunk on the koolaid of ""every new agent can make 10k a month your first year"" to succeed.
The only con is yourself. If you don't put in the work & effort that will reflect on your income.
Just about anybody can be a Team Lead so luck of the draw if you get a good one or not.
There are no cons for working here besides some days you need a little bit more of a mental push than others but its the same way with any other position.
AIL is not a place for someone who doesn't like working with people, nor is it a good opportunity for the unfocused or lazy. You get out what you out in.
Es dificil realmente mencionar algo que no este bien, es un trabajo competitivo, pero el fin es cumplir tus propias metas, entonces es por ti mismo, asi que, no le tienes que trabajar a otra persona.
all commission no salary available
You get the pros by condensing a 40/45 year career into a 10 year window. You have to work hard, you can't show up and collect a paycheck.
- leadership varies from agency to agency. two agents can have vastly different experiences - You need to be entrepreneurial and understand this is a commission position. it is not a cushy work from home job even though it may be virtual.
Merit based compensation. This company is great if you have great work ethics and willing to put in the work. If you are willing to put in the effort and time, this will truly reward you for 100% of what you put in. So if you're a selfstarter and eager to learn, this is the place for you. If you're more of a 9-5 clock in, clock out; this is not the place for you.
I have not found a downside in my on most 3 yrs working here I love my job and the company
Honestly i don’t think there is any cons they cover everything i want in a career

They gradually lead you into their cult. You need to memorize a book on life insurance nearly immediately. Then you're asked to have $39 to take the test at another location. Great, you passed! Now you need to pony up another $250 before orientation! Cool. Thanks for that. Please attend your online Zoom training but... before you do, you're required to have a spare room in your house. Do you? No? Rejected!!! You do have one? Nice! We will now require you to turn this room into an opulent kingdom on your own dime. You must appear to be wealthy. Watch your wall colors. Make sure you have the best lighting money can buy! An original Warhol painting would be ideal. As it were said, ""it cannot be Chevy Cavalier, you MUST project 'Audi'-level money behind you on these calls"". If you can't pull this off the way we expect, you will be rejected at training. Thank you for remodeling your home. Now, I know some literature mentioned a ""base rate"" pay. This base rate is $0 and you're required to contribute a minimum of $5 a week to some vague fund. You will only grow to spend ever increasing amounts of money on this job before you even begin. You will ask about what the base rate of pay they've mentioned actually is and nobody will tell you the answer -- they'll just walk around in circles about ""earnings potential""... because there IS NO PAY unless you've sold anyone on them.
I have not found a downside in my on most 3 yrs working here I love my job and the company
Not much in the cons because the pros far outweigh any con for me.

Hard work lots of phone time
If you do not like to work hard or are just hoping to clock in & clock out this would be the wrong career for you.
Non at all, you get what’s you put in.
Hard work. Not easy but it’s simple.

Dialing for dollars and having to depend on clients
Oh goodness where do I start? Micromanaging to the extreme. I was constantly watched like a hawk. Management made a “losers” bracket. Which they thought was encouraging. Yikes. Management would force new hires to get “coded” aka writing your first deal in the business then they won’t help you.

I should’ve believed the reviews and not moved forward with American income.
Long hours. Cold calls all day long. Agents had same leads to work or were old and already called a trillion times before. They tell you you'll be paid for training- lie. All you need is your home license- lie. They will starve you on leads until you purchase more state licenses for leads. Their policies are inferior compared to others. Most clients can't afford the policies, are too old or have too many health issues to qualify. If you do sell a policy whatever you do don't spend that money they paid you on. If the client cancels within that year, you will now owe the company back pay on it.
Very stressful. You have quotas to meet and they can be challenging. There is no hand holding so you really just have to be results driven, However, what we are offering is honestly really good and there isnt really a major competitor. If you are great at talking to people and can handle some rejection you will love it.
MLM scheme. Sketchy recruiting process. Lied in the job listing ad by pretending to be a different company. Leads are old. They expect long hours and mandatory meetings without any base pay. Dumb 'motivational' meetings that are just a waste of time, where they use empty catch phrases like 'be your own boss' when you clearly have a boss and work for a massive corporation. They try to add extra hours to make up for national holidays, Very sketchy, stay away,
Getting treated like a telemarketer. Not being adequately educated in the products you are selling. Being trained to be a pushy sales rep. Not being adequately trained in ALL aspects of the job . Just an overall mess.
Long hours in first 90 days. State requires a license.
Not much in the cons because the pros far outweigh any con for me.
Hard work lots of phone time
If you do not like to work hard or are just hoping to clock in & clock out this would be the wrong career for you.
Non at all, you get what’s you put in.
•you scam union workers into joining meetings and hit them with the bait and switch to try and sell insurance products •captive •”vested renewals lost if you don’t work there for 10 years •leads are heavily recycled and old •SGA cares about his wallet not your success •one of the highest turnover rates I’ve ever seen in this industry •so bad I’m adding it again, lying to union workers because your sales reps are so bad you can’t get them to meet any other way •newly in 2023, being forced to hound friends and family And the list goes on. Save yourself the trouble. This isn’t the place. Someone sold you a dream. They’re? At the top of the MLM, you? You’ll be broke in a month or two.
Hard work. Not easy but it’s simple.
Dialing for dollars and having to depend on clients
Lots of hours put in for pay not guarantee.
You are calling from a lead list. Some people may not want to hear what you have to say. If sales aren't your thing, you may not like this job.
Long work days, hard sometimes with small children but manageable
Only having 24 hours in a day
It is commission only. If you aren't pressed for money it's okay to start, but if you need to be making money fast it can be hard to stay consistent
Can be difficult at times living so far from the home office!!!! There are times working from home can be tough but I do love it!!!
The Schedule is different compared to your ""normal"" 9-5
Show ratio of clients is a work in progress, but is improving
Show ratio of clients is a work in progress, but is improving
too many meetings micromanaging/handholding to an uncomfortable expectation bad management tactics Not truly in business for yourself required to recruit to make the money levels that they boast you are going to be expected to market without any direction on what materials are allowed team building is pushed so hard you cannot avoid it - MLM
Got to be good at time management
Phone lines are extremely busy. Hardly any time for administration work or tasks off phone that need handling. 6 months probationary period before raise for taking a promotion.
Good good good good good
You have to work, no boss telling you to clock in or clock out so gotta have discipline.
Not many bad things I can say
The company according to some has bad reputation
They want you to work so many hours and attend so many meetings. I would work 14-15 hour days. If you didn’t fit their needs and standards of being all in, they’d get upset saying you’re not dedicated enough to build a business when they ironically say they have great flexibility. They expect you to change your mindset immediately being onboard and will see you as less if you take longer than they did. It wasn’t the pressure that made me leave, it was the way management was arrogant and extremely up in your personal business.
100% commission can be stressful at times
1099 completely even threw training training video and hiring manager made me feel as though the company started you off with base pay in a ""funnel"" system until we had commision to pay back the funnel???
Licensing test is the hardest part and getting everything down
If I would have to say something that’s a downside it may be the hours, but you have to practice your trade/job to become great!
Not enough hours in the day!
You’ll work a lot of hours to master the job at the start
A lot of hard work needs to be put in with a lot of hours, but that just generates the best results income wise.
Seems hard in the beginning, just like anything else. You have to apply yourself to achieve desired results. Not for the faint or heart.
Bad leads, they expect you to get your own referrals
long hours, 100% commission, pyramid scheme, cold calls
Have to put in the work to be successful, but when you do the success will be bigger than you ever thought possible for yourself.

My biggest pro about my franchisee is that I love that he doesn’t treat us like a number. He under stands that we are human, and family comes first. I use to cringe when my higher ups would call us a family but now as I am approaching my 5 year mark, we truly do treat each other as so. My sister stores are always trying to help us where they can, even though I am the farthest away from the majority of them. I love that Great Clips comes with their own clientele already, along with a base pay and at my specific location (corner of E. Stadium and Packard) we get our charged tips at the end of night, every night in a separate tip card which I think is pretty cool. There was never much drama at this location, and I found everyone in management and HR were quick to nip it in the butt.

Franchise Owners and CEO of operations are very kind and nice people. They pay a little higher per hour than most franchise competitors. They own 30+ stores as of writing this and throw a Christmas Party for everyone every year which is pretty cool. Managers are mostly understanding and compassionate people. No drama is really tolerated by the CEO of Operations. She personally trains people in haircutting at times and loves doing it! Room for growth if you are interested in management. They offer medical insurance, PTO, and holiday pay 90 days to one year of employment. You will learn how to cut hair effectively with the GC university classes and training provided. It took me about 3 months with the support I got to fully get into the swing of haircuts as someone who only cut sometimes before I started.
Friendly fun exciting great boss
You will make good money, especially after tips. Good way to build clientele. You get most holidays off (Christmas, Easter, Fourth of July etc) and after one year you get paid for 5 hours during those holidays.

I like working for Team Sailing Great Ckips because they make me feel like an important part of the company, I feel like they actually care about me as a human being. I get PTO, they pay about 65% of our insurance premiums, they have a great continued education program so I can grow myself as a stylist, and they have tons of ways to make yourself an extra buck and advancement opportunities. I've been with them for 7 years now and I've seen the company change so much in all the best ways. I may be a little biased because I'm so loyal, but there's a reason for that, I genuinely believe I wouldn't be happier anywhere else.

I get PTO, they pay about 65% of our insurance premiums, they have a great continued education program so I can grow myself as a stylist, and they have tons of ways to make yourself an extra buck and advancement opportunities. I've been with them for 7 years now and I've seen the company change so much in all the best ways. I may be a little biased because I'm so loyal, but there's a reason for that, I genuinely believe I wouldn't be happier anywhere else.
Very inclusive environment with managers and owners that care.
Great team, good friendly stylist.
You will gain lots of experience quick
Good tips and nice company to work for
Decent insurance package not great but what is
it is good like the people
Great place to work. Friendly owners
Worked long hours for fun
Being able to work on many different types of clients, helping you further your knowledge of hair. Paid training when hired. Insurance for full time employees.
The salon is very clean and the vibe is fun , relaxed and professional. We are all a great team and are here for each other. The salon is fast pace and we love meeting new people , creating new relationships and enjoy building the relationships then we have with returning costumers.
You might make some real friends.
It’s a very flexible job where you always can make money with tips and helps build your clientele! The training is great as well you learn a diversity of haircuts with kids woman to men including different hair textures. Great clips makes it where you follow a hair cut system that helps you keep you on track on hair cutting time so when you have your outline all you have to do is connect everything.you learn a lot on the floor so I’d really recommend starting off at great clips you learn a good amount and the diversity helps to achieve that.
You learn how to cut hair out of cos school really really quickly Tips are decent if you’re a fast cutter
Training, flexibility, advancement, benefits and atmosphere.
Good tips, store manager and employees were great.
Good tips in busy days.
Busy,place to work long hours.
I love working at Great Clips! The team is really friendly and supportive, and I feel like I'm part of a family here. There great training, which really helped me feel comfortable comming out of school. The salon is always busy, which means there are lots of clients to work with. And the flexible scheduling makes it little easier to balance work and and the rest of life.
Tips added to a prepaid card assigned to you daily, after your day to work schedule.
I made more money than average working here. The staff are friendly and professional as well as very talented. Most people have been here for 5+ years. With tips I make about $27-$30 an hour
Has a good base pay, make good tips because it’s always busy, they cover part of your healthcare, managers are nice and will work with you
Support from corporate as a franchisee is second to none
Instant customers, cash everyday friendly people
You end up making decent enough tips that make up for the low hourly, but not quite enough to live comfortably. Easy to move from state to state with this company and it worked well for me being from Arizona, going to school in Idaho and then ending up in UT. It’s good in that regard.
One of the best things about working at Great clips is having a Flexible schedule. My husband works Monday through Friday and I can work in the evening and the weekends without having to pay for daycare for our little ones. Also You dont have to build your own clientele so if you are new to the area or just out of school you will be avlw to cut hair right away and don’t have to put yourself out there.
Amazing people! Generous leadership, lots of fun events throughout the month to keep up company moral.
Tips in your pocket every day
staff feels like family we all work together in all things clean, etc good pay flexible hours works with u well when u have appments or. need off
No chemicals Training offered Productivity bonuses Fast paced Good tips Paid vacation Health insurance
Nice coworkers, great customers, good tips to supplement pay as you get no raises
Money was okay, hourly pay was not great, but made good tips.
Training, flexibility, advancement, benefits and atmosphere.
It is easy to get hired.
The only pro I can give is that you get a employee discount on products.
Great place to get your foot in the door in hairdressing. Every type of hair walks in for you to work on and get experience
Busy environment with a minimum of 10 haircuts.
Great Extensive Training for any that requires it.
Good variety of clients (men, women, children, old, young, etc.) If you want to focus on cuts and not color, this is one of the only chains that doesn't do color decent tips

","Lots of travel. Hard to have a good balance.
Corporate requires that all Great Clips salons be open seven days a week. I understand we are the world's largest salon brand and have a lot to live up to, but I feel like we are currently living in a world where allowing franchisees to choose to be closed one day a week would be extremely helpful for moral, staffing and success.
Location Matters - If you're looking for a lot of money fast, some locations are slower than others. Management can be finicky - some managers are qualified to work in that capacity others aren't based on experience. HR is virtually non-existent so all internal affairs are managed by the manager - this can be a pro or a con depending. Some Franchisees own a lot of salons, so if you're looking to have a clear connection between owner and staff, it most likely won't happen because their plate is too full with their other salons.
Owner at my location was not great. With walkins only, sometimes it's really dead so you don't make any tips. It can get really busy on the weekends, and the longer people wait the less they tip, so you end up running yourself ragged for less money than on an average day.
No set day off. If you want set days off you get a lower hourly
This company does not pay a living wage for the area I live in, nor the years of experience I have. And they are open 7 days a week, meaning an user schedule. Hard to plan work life balance.
Low management comes without skills and micro-manages while asserting their dominance over others. The level of condescension is astounding and expressing your feelings to your manager is a futile endeavor.
Bad hours and bad customers
Not a single thing I can think of.
drama between co-workers no accountability for co-workers who are unreliable and not any added recognition for being reliable must do things the Great Clips way which is good and bad its a corporation end of day you are just another cog

I don’t have many cons about my job currently, if you have ever worked for a Great Clips you know that since they are individually owned, they all do stuff a little differently. Coming from another location may be hard to get used to the way a new shop does things. And of course, working in customer service always comes with some cons as working with the public isn’t always ideal but as long as you let it roll off your back, and keep it at the shop you'll have a great shift.

Not enough hard working stylists. Short staffing.

Hard work, holidays weekends required, more pto
Need more staff High waits
The company I work for is great! I cannot honestly say anything I would change about them, if you have a problem they are so willing to listen.
The nastiest people come in and you have to cut their hair!
- Rude customers - Split-Shifts every once in a while
You will never get a pay raise no matter how long or hard you work there. They don't treat the stylists good AT. ALL. (at least when I worked there). Even though they were full-time employees, they were never scheduled full-time so the owners didn't have to give them their benefits. Super scummy business in general and would never suggest anyone other than a student to work there.
Work can be overwhelming sometimes
Monotonous and repetitive. Cut after cut. No raises. Tips are nice but hours aren't the best. A lot of turnover so the ones of us who stayed weren't appreciated enough in my opinion. Those hours aren't easy. Especially with a family.
No problem N/A N/A N/A
Clients can be rude Insurance isn't the best Standing on feet all day Overworked at times
Some days do so many hair cuts your arms and shoulders feel as though they might fall off.
schedule customers franchisees emplyees timed haircuts
Work can be overwhelming sometimes
No problem N/A N/A N/A
It is Difficult to find quality and reliable stylists, many of the stores are short staffed and hours of operation are either same or increase is expected. It can take months for an interview to come through for your store and it could be a dead end. Stores in desperate need are put first which is understandable. Some managers have to work by themselves at times and staff are stretched thin. The Clientele that GC attracts can be the most cheap, rude, and picky people you will ever meet. They come in with $8 coupon for haircut and leave $0-1 tips. Some will scroll for coupon at checkout and waste your time. Some parents will also hover over you and give no personal space when cutting their children’s hair. They will get upset when you ask them to sit down. Some clients will call and point blank ask for discounts and coupons after learning the price ( the cheapest you can get around here) and huff when you don’t give them a discount. Some costumers are generous tippers and give $8-10, sometimes $20 when you hit the lottery, but expect $2-3 to be the average tip. You are blessed if you break $50 in daily tips around my area. You have to cut 25-30 haircuts to reach $100 which is very hard on your mind and body. When you pay $15,000-20,000 for cosmetology school, this can be discouraging. You can find better pay and more generous clients at other salons and make more money without having to make high productivity goals for raises.
Less pay no benefits no pto
Terrible hours. 8am to 9pm, and there is a rule that if a group of people come in one minute before you still have to cut their hair. They need to start closing earlier if they want to retain employees. Management had no authority in dealing with bullies or bad employees, they only really existed to work 50 hour weeks and get yelled at by customers. The cheap prices and quick service attracts a lot of “Karen” types with hundreds of badly behaved kids which was exhausting. They do not allow you to take breaks. When I had Covid they wrote me up for not coming in when it would have been illegal for me to do so.

Don’t care for the time limits on services, doesn’t seem personal when you have to sound like a robot with their 5 step protocol. Never able to get lunch breaks in.
Crap pay , no way to make more or incentives, no actual benefits (offer Aflac). Tips are not paid out daily and added to your check. Turnover is ridiculous and they should really do background checks on the employees or at least management!
Expected to work most weekends
Employee turnover rate is high

I don't get as much time with my family as I'd like

They're still working on retirement plans. Sometimes people get too many chances, but I'd rather be with a company like that than one that never gives any at all. I live kinda far from my furthest location, but there is a travel incentive that makes up for it.
I've had no negative experiences with the company.
Work life balance could definitely be better
Some customers can be cheap

The owner does not reciprocate trust. Making overall work environment hostile towards employees.

Corporate is out of touch with an ever changing world/ workforce. Gone are the days when a stylist would do a 12 hour shift on a daily basis and work every weekend, gone are the days when employees would GC first before family and friends and rest and life. Gone are the days when employees would with stand the verbal and monetary abuse from franchise owner's and managers. We're heading into the 21st century GC is stuck in the 20th. Everyone knows but them
nothing bad about it ok
Not many cons with this company
Didnt work at all haha
Poor pay/unfair pay (being paid less than a new employee with less experience/slower cut times/less product sales), poor communication, revolving door- new employees every week not being given proper training or being trained by coworkers instead of management. Commissions are minimum and not competitive at all. 15 minute haircuts. Verbal punishment/abuse by upper management.
Taking a break is frustrating for both the costumer and stylist. There is no way to put a note on the online check-in to reflect the changing wait times as we check in and out.
Management plays favorites. They don’t care if the non-favorites have health issues. Non-favorites will not get promoted. You are not allowed to voice the truth without them getting upset. Very high turnover
You do get a few rude clients that refuse to release information which is fine but it does keep them on edge the beginning of the haircuts at times. At that point I’d just recommend just keeping it about hair and talk about what your doing so it makes it less awkward.
Vacation is hard to get around the holidays because of “black out dates” which are dates you will not get off if requested. Usually low on staff so you end up pulling a lot of weight Short shifts, yet still considered a full time employee
Sometimes you don't want to work weekend days , but that's where you make the most money!
Hard to get time off even when asking weeks in advance, horrible customers, higher ups did not seem to care about employees needs
Hours and low pay. Bad upper management.
Customers care. Retail sales,fair hours.
The fast-paced nature of the salon can be stressful for some people, but means better tips.
Gossipy, messy, slandering,, coworkers and management team.
Huge staffing issue. Policies are a little old fashioned. Work lots of hours just to keep stores open. Tips are where the moneys at, not the hourly wage ($14-$18)
It’s a company, so they have certain guidelines you have to follow. Rotation schedule so you don’t always have the same scheduling.
None that I have encountered with the company
None really I had worked for the owners of York crossing before and chose to come back due to how they treat their stylists
Not a good work place for a good home life balance. The shop is open until 9pm most days. Underpaid and overworked. Heber, Downtown Salt Lake, and many other Great Clips were having a hard time hiring so we’d ask for volunteers from our staff and schedule them there. I helped out lots at various shops all over the state and never was I compensated for the time I spent helping out. After doing this for the company for months on end, I finally talked to our GM and said look I am willing to help but I’d appreciate if I was given mileage reimbursement or a raise with all the help my team and I had been giving. There was never mileage reimbursement from driving from Orem as far as Park City and Heber some days. Eventually I got a dollar raise. No guarantees for work when it’s slow traffic. A lot of your pay is contingent on sales, heavy traffic of customers and good tips. These things are usually so inconsistent that you can have very low money making days. Creativity and furthered education is not provided by the salon. Therefore any outside learning I wanted to add to my tool belt was paid by me for me even though I was bettering myself for the company I was working for. It made me realize that I wanted to do better for me and for me only and didn’t need to work for a crappy company anymore.
There are black out dates during the holidays and certain times during the year that you can’t request Time off.
If you do not have a degree there is very little room to advance.
Rude, hateful and scary customers created a terrible environment for staff and the nice clients
working Saturday sometimes. not being able to wear shorts in summer, lol otherwise no complaints
Must work weekends and closing shifts Very fast paced not for slow cutters Must work some holidays and all holiday eves Schedule changes every week Can’t choose your own schedule Long shifts 8/9 hours sometimes longer No retirement or IRA
owner is toxic, micro-manages, even if you earn vacation days impossible to take and never approves days off during the weekend even if you request months in advance. always short staffed and you never get a raise or bonuses. no work/life balance whatsoever
Long hours/days, wasn't allowed time off(or being given time off but only in turn for 6 day weeks or no days off). Management was poor, and very secretive, I wasn't allowed to know base pay( because I was payed much lower than my coworkers) and generally unfair. I was under payed for the majority of my time there, I was being payed 10.25 hourly working 40 hour weeks, with one day off. Overall kinda sucked.
Sometimes you don't want to work weekend days , but that's where you make the most money!
Does not meet the minimum cost of living in income for anyone.
It’s a chop shop don’t do it! Great Clips as a whole is a horrible corporation. They only care about one thing and one thing only-how many haircuts you can do in an hour. It doesn’t matter if you have hair down to your a#$ that hasn’t been combed or washed in a year I have to cut your hair in 15 mins or I’m docked.
Low pay. Time limits on hair cuts
Leave and become blacklisted to other future employment. Systematic write ups and warnings
Very Strict on performance and sales. Have to look forward toward commission versus pay. Which is great If, you meet the daily quota. Stressful, would not recommend for parents unless you have an open negotiable schedule within your home and or reliable child care.
Not much upward mobility regulars are discouraged quantity over quality of cuts emphasized you'll only be given 6 hours shifts during the week you'll get a half hour unpaid break, but if it's busy, expect to take it 5 minutes at a time

","No space to promoto to another carrer level
- Salary was only £40k - Hybrid working with more emphasis to be in the office - Flexible working policy is not flexible (had the option to come in earlier and leave earlier which was then revoked on the basis that packing up and leaving desks was disruptive to other employees...) - Manager lacks managerial experience (being told off in front of manager's husband, told off for wearing jeans in the office when most people wear jeans etc) - Impossible deadlines (within the next hour) - High staff turnover (3 people within the same team left) - No help with inflation even though the business made billions - No clear career progression - Clear favouritism within the analyst team
Not much room for growth
A corporation, so anything revolving around a corporation
Unhealthy environment and leaders. Inability to grow within the company and within your role. Expected to work long hours and take on new work with no compensation.
Not much room to move
Virtually no room for growth. Marketing managers have been there for over 10 years, so you don't have a chance for a promotion unless you transfer to the New York office.
You can only work 20h/wk
Less strict with their own community people.
None that I have experienced
over laden with corporate bureaucracy
Hard work, the team is understaffed and so is the company making there be a lot of work
Stagnant career growth, leadership doesn't listen very well. Recent tech leadership an HR issue.
Las oficinas son pequeñas y el espacio reducido para tantos trabajadores.
Dont have any problems here
I worked for Estee Lauder companies right after i finished my masters degree in marketing first in class at a school in London, UK and already had four years ad agency experience. I worked as a marketing intern with no pay for 8 months right out of my masters degree when I had a lot of school debt, as I wanted to get into the beauty industry. I was not offered a job after that and there were many girls doing the same internships at that time. Some girls were interning for a year or longer, in order to secure a job. Years later as I was still working in industry I worked as Marketing Manager in Toronto, Canada where i am from. We worked on the Clinique brand and worked every saturday. One weekend I went on a trip without taking any time off and my flight was very delayed I came home at 2am and i was so tired i wanted to take one vacation day off. When i came to work the next day my boss pulled me into an office and full on yelled at me and told me “you obviously dont care about this job”… Thanks Estee Lauder but never again...
It is a public company and that comes with financial pressure.
Overloaded. Over work time. Try to learn work life integrations.
Not much upward growth available
Things take longer because it's a bigger company. You start off as a number, and have to put in the work to create a name for yourself.

Recently the Company direction has been very confusing, and this brought about frustration among employees.
Because the company operates in the retail industry, hours are long and can be erratic. As a marketer there, you may have to dedicate working on the weekends (sometimes even holidays) because those are the key shopping moments the business thrives on. Setting good and firm boundaries is a must if you ever plan to have good work-life balance.
The office location is not ideal since it's slightly out of the way
Field employees do not visit enough. They make decisions remotely about issues based on what they are told about from complaints of team members who are not ethical.
Fast paced, self learn environment
The progression is difficult or even to get a pay rise. Very unfair and un-motivating as people get to cover for so many vacancies.
It took too long to be promoted.
Stressful in driving business growth Work life balance
Depending on the brand, it can have a hierarchical culture which can slow down decision making
Growing opportunities to apply and develó your Carrer.
Work long hours and your work is always with you
No remote work flexibility, hybrid is available
Work life balance is not always the best
All departments are under control of US finance no real benefits 3 days per week working form office
Some bad management and some good

Field employees do not visit enough. They make decisions remotely about issues based on what they are told about from complaints of team members who are not ethical.
Fast paced, self learn environment
Getting a bit bureaucratic, too many layers. Slow to get things done.
No current cons at the moment
No weekends off would have to request
Pay for middle-managers is not competitive. The people doing most of the work are compensated the least.
No life work balance. Really poor pay ( minimum wage) It says on their job advert they pay £30K base pay, this is highly misleading as the reason I left, and I worked there for 6 years plus. Was because the pay was so bad.
Hard to break into corporate jobs
Working Saturdays Sales goals Low wage for work
Short/ unrealistic timelines for the amount of work
There is usually no one to consult with.
Comparably fewer team-building activities and less corporate learning resources
Racist. Sizeist. Ableist. Toxic environment. Horrible regional leadership. No growth opportunities. If you didn't ""fit the mold"" you were pushed out.
Inconsistent work, demands not appropriate for the area in which your located. Lack of communication and few perks.
Not a flexible schedule. Long hours.
Less hours to work…. ..
Sometimes stressful to meet objectives

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Dow-Reviews-E207.htm,"Good work/life balance, nice pay, cheap CoL
Lots of exposure to people and work problems.
competitive pay, flexible work, low cost of living
I found Dow to be serious about EHS performance and taking care of employees, communities, and the environment. EHS concerns were prioritized, and leaders typically really meant that ""safety is #1.""
Dow has a relatively good culture of people which is one of the best parts of working there. It is almost guaranteed that you will work on very challenging and meaningful projects/endeavors during your time. They have a 9/80 schedule for most employees except for shift operations which is nice. They also have good 401K matching and an employee stock purchasing program if you choose to participate. Dow is also relatively good at letting you choose your career path compared to some other big oil/gas/chemical companies out there. You are usually not stuck in the pipeline of the job you're currently in if you don't want to be and work hard.
Flexibility, advancement, challenging, team work.
There are lots of pros for working at Dow. The benefits are great and the pay is in line with industry standards.
Try to They try to be inclusive, and fair with pay and benefits
Large Company with room to move laterally and vertically Good DEI objectives (if that is something you really really value)

Dow is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.
Everybody I've interacted with is generally professional and means well. Mid level management is overall pretty good. The company has a pretty good Design your Workday program that allows certain employees to work a hybrid schedule. It is also a great company for parents. The leaders I worked for have been pretty flexible with time off and flex time.
You get to work by yourself
Very safety focused company. Ability to move plants or job roles if desired.
-Leadership will listen to your career desires if you document it in HR system -Moving up ladder is doable if you’re good at talking…politics matter -Culture is good in most businesses. Collaborative. If you ask for help you will get it. Must be able to be confident to obtain this help -Work-life balance is outstanding in commercial realm. No one cares if your sick, no one cares if you take a day off to handle appointments. Most don’t even log their vacation. No one cares.

401K / Insurance / WLB / relocation package just alright
Dow really supports and respects all people. The company really values inclusion and makes everyone feel included. We have a diverse team and they offer development opportunities for women in leadership.
In R&D, you are empowered to make decisions and become a subject matter expert. You are respected if it is deserved. Compensation is competitive and there aren't many extra frills that take away from your benefits package.
Great company to work at. Real global culture, you get to meet and interact with people across the globe. Everybody is very open to share their knowledge and learn from each other.

","middle of nowhere, you better like the nature
I can not think of any.
cyclical industry with highs and lows
Dow management was sometimes indecisive and timid - avoiding making hard decisions such as firing an employee or pushing back against a unhelpful requirement. In addition, Dow is weighed down by layers of bureaucracy, resulting in a slow-moving organization that doesn't directly address problems.
Dow pays a good bit less than some of the competitors, yet works you harder. I have friends at all competitive companies and they all make more than me with the same or less years of experience. They also have less responsibilities in similar comparison roles to mine. I find that I am working many more hours and have a lot more responsibility than my peers at other companies yet I am not compensated for it. This is a challenge as I find i don't get to utilize my 9/80 schedule like I would like to as I'm often working. Production engineering is very busy and truly is a firefighting job. If you like that, then you may like a production engineer role. Fight for a higher salary if you can, because dow will work every hour out of you. There is no overtime for salary, except in certain situations where they give you a very small percent of your salary for no matter how many hours you work over 65 in a week. Its disheartening as Dow gets my time and efforts for free a lot of the time.
There are none, it’s a great place.
There really are no cons.
Inter company movement doesn’t pay fairly typically, work life balance isn’t great
Pay Cut in benefits People will not appreciate you for your work. Toxic work culture.
-low pay compared to other companies -hierarchal -favoritism -lots of racism from old white men -hire outside talent that they should have not hired - while they do promote within - they miss opportunities
Everything is great except heavy work load sometimes
Management can be shady Recent Reorganization of the company has fired/let go of good people Shift work is rough. (I worked a 7-2 Swing shift.)
A lot of the I&D work is performative & definitely a toxic positivity vibe. They don’t always want to hear what the gaps are, just create nice marketing stories that appeal to their audience. Meanwhile, employees actually need things fixed & struggle to navigate systems. They make employees & ERGs shoulder the burden & take on extra unpaid work to push for change, then wonder why people are burnt out & they lack diversity. Simply put, Dow wants to be the most innovative & inclusive company…unless it costs them money. They will always pick the cheapest solution even to their own detriment. Too much groupthink & lack of desire to fix broken systems & processing, especially in HR. Lack of workforce to actually staff many projects, runs really lean so progress is slow. Many facilities need to be fixed & are run down or lack accessibility features. You need to conform to make it. The idea of bringing your authentic self to work is a joke. Not sure why people think Dow is woke, still the same conservative good ole boys club, just rebranding. Also lots of passive aggressive attitudes that likely come from Midwest culture.
None that I can think of.
Can be political at times
There a no downsides working here
Hard to move onto salaried roles.
A lot of corporate politics and clickiness
Non thing to share right now
Lots of red tape and paperwork
Much more bureaucracy and political than small companies.
High workload High stress Politics Nepotism Pay not on par
They have a hard time getting rid of their bad employees
Hard to get promoted once you are good at your current position.
Management Robotic Woke Political Policies
None that I can think of.
Over time the company as a whole has been really spreading people thin. You will likely do more work than would be expected of you in a different company. If you participate on teams or volunteer to take on large projects, you will not necessarily get promoted or significant raises based on it - Usually it just ends up being more work piled on top of the already large pile of work that you already have with no significant compensation. Part of the culture seems to be to always strive to do slightly more than your assigned role. Aside from this, the company will make changes to processes with little to no warning and without asking for input or researching how it will logistically work in practice. Generally, these process changes have a negative impact and cause increased bureaucracy, unnecessary work time, confusion and negatively effects the overall culture.
Not enough hours or pay. Pay is crappy.
Always offloading task to operations. Since I have been here salaried has slowly taken more of their task and given them to operations. Can be frustrating when writing permits and isolating equipment all day. Then ask why you haven't submitted some paper work that was their job
-Safety is a facade depending on the business. If a chemical is known to be dangerous but it’s an integral part of the industry, low customer safety is ignored -Poor onboarding process across the board -Poor job descriptions. Must be able to say no. Leadership support is key to saying no without negative ramifications -Salary increase is decided by leadership twice in a year, only a set amount of budget is provided and your boss has to advocate for you. Cowardly boss means no promotion, but you can gain favoritism one above your leader to get support. Must be smooth with this process. Natural pay bump is targeted every 3 yrs -D&I: they only care about women in leadership. I see minimal POC ratios except for asian.
High workload High stress Politics Nepotism Pay not on par
They have a hard time getting rid of their bad employees
Low salary comapared to oil companies
The scope of work is limited and dependent on how much money the plants half. You will end up doing a lot of monotonous activities. It is unlikely that you will progress laterally in this position.
Growth potential is limited and cyclical business
I can’t think of any
Hard to get promoted once you are good at your current position.

HDQ is in a mid-size town a couple of hours drive away from the nearest metropolitan city - a definite lifestyle choice if joining HDQ.

After the Dow/DuPont split, the much small Dow company does not appear to have their heart in investing in science and technology anymore. I would rate Dow a 2 star after the spin-off and formation of the smaller company.
HDQ is in a mid-size town a couple of hours drive away from the nearest metropolitan city - a definite lifestyle choice if joining HDQ.
Leadership is very short sighted. Growth is more and more limited every month. Pendulum from bonuses to massive job cuts swings very fast. Becoming cut throat again.
Forgotten division with bare minimum reinvestment from company
Always down sizing and selling off parts of company to third party’s.
slow management, no promotions very slow
Same as most operator jobs cons, training and qualifying is a little more on the tough side
Work life balance could be better.
It's a chemical company. Despite some very substantial steps the company is taking (carbon neutral plant in Canada, nuclear generator on the Gulf Coast, etc.), the chemical industry is still labeled as ""evil"" by many people. It will be a long road to changing that perception.
The job is very stressful and hectic
Like any large company, there is bureaucracy and certain people who become roadblocks
None, many systems may take some time to learn
your manager and director change very often
Work load continues to endlessly grow.
The process driven culture can also be a negative for entrepreneurially minded folks
None at all too much nepotism and politics. At one time it was an honorable place to work. Jobs are being cut and work loads have gotten heavier for those still around.
Fast Pace Environment and nothing else
Company is based in Midwest so if you want to advance your career to highest level will likely need to spend time living in a small midwestern city.
You will get the standard corporate experience, including unproductive administrative tasks and dealing with middle management.
Large corporations tend to be sluggish and somewhat rigid.
Schedule , Operators have a lot of responsibility when it comes to the average employee , Have to be able to wear many hats , must be well versed on multiple aspects of the company , while other roles can focus and become masters in one area

Kills individual initiative - DOW - Do our way Performance management based on perceptions vs results delivered
Decision making process is slower
- - - - -
Training can be aliitle better in some units.
Near plant with constant alarms and releases. Flaming of chemicals can heard miles away.
Awfully bureaucratic at times, with the lack of flexibility impacting productivity. There are a number of senior roles that don't provide near the output that the plant-level people put out. Bloated, career-sunset roles
Difficult to move within the company
Slow moving at times. Structured progression dissuades high performers. Political at times
Swing shift and rotating schedules
Could always pay better... Raises have not kept up with inflation, starting salaries from new hires are catching up to me. Benefits could be better. Could treat WFH employees with better benefits. Don't contribute anything to help with costs.
Long working hours and sometimes difficult work
If you have a good leader and good sponsor you will have a great upwardly mobile career at Dow, but otherwise you can expect to be stuck where you are indefinitely.
Too big to succeed to grow to leadership levels
Job levels keep getting downgraded to save money.
Slow moving at times. Structured progression dissuades high performers. Political at times
Was fine until the department got a hypocrite for a supervisor then it went downhill from there.
Night shift rotation was mandatory. Quality was bare minimum. No growth.
Get treated just like a contractor. You're just another number. They promote the laziest people and keep the hard-working people where they are.
Swing shift and rotating schedules
Constant and Consistent layoffs. Toxic internal culture everyone and every department is competing against each other, so no one works as a team. No opportunities for you to grow. Lack of investment in employees Low morale

The HR is weak, frequent hiring freezes and below average pay
Lack of diversity in teams
-Absolutely no flexibility in location assignment, you go where you're told. -Worst recruiters/talent acquisition team I've ever seen.
Very hard to integrate diverse talents Location of HQ sucks
Constantly changing standards and leadership
Establish better presentation of red tag violations to help employees keep their jobs.
Low pay, slow upward mobility in the company, company is extremely particular with terminology.

The field is dying. Leadership from a corporate level down to the field keeps making terrible decisions. Ultimately, their business model for the field force will not be sustainable and the agents through RSC levels will all fade out.
I can't think of a single negative thing.
None at this current time
Management, chaotic work environment, no advancement opportunities
If you are operations-focused and not into sales, your career path isn't as clear
Starter company, no set structure
No room for growth at all.
Not too many cons, building just cold
The program is 2 years long Things can move pretty slowly
Management was ridiculous and gossip like children
Not a remote position, high call volume
-100% commission -My local boss never showed up to my training sessions, and never responded to my messages. I had no help from the company.
Only commission job. First year can be rough if you don't have the right guidance. First year you only get a commission when your clients enroll and no when you check on them or file claims. You are on the road all the time and pay for your own gas. If one of your clients drops their policy or don't pay their bill for the month, it goes against you because you already received a commission when they initially enrolled.
Inadequate Training; 8 weeks of training before you take calls is not enough for expectations once you are on the floor actually handling calls, management expects you to know a lot more than provided during training. Unreasonable Call Time Expectations; Have to handle all calls within 5-6 minutes. If you go to HR with a complaint you will definitely be targeted to lose your job.
slow to grant opportunities to get off phones and go to other departments SO much favoritism right now they are just hiring anybody ,,, the ratchets have arrived !
Leadership disrespect, very heavy work load.,
Since being hired at the company, the workload has changed for the worst.
unorganized processes, internal confusion, catty atmosphere with some other workers
Great Culture within the company dedicated to their customers and employees
Aflac Group: Middle managers need to be developed. Office politics play into promotions and organizational redesign. People have been in the same position for too long. If you aren't like by someone, they use the influence to stop your growth, even at the management level.

Difficult to solve issues, no one to advise.
You have to be careful once you have some clients. The incidence of Brokers with the blessing of Aflac Management can come in and take your account. They do this by getting appointed with Aflac and then working with a Market director and moving in on an existing Aflac account by offering a complete offering of Health Insurance, Dental, 401 K, Long Term disability, etc. This practice is becoming more prevalent and management doesn't care about the Agent who built up and serviced the account.
managers steal your money for a few years for no reason
there isn’t any cons for aflac
Cold calling, cold canvassing & internal competition
It’s literally a scam, a MLM scheme. 0 base pay, commission only. You pay for all your own licensing. You literally walk around business parks going door to door to try and set up an appt to discuss products further, legitimately desperately bombarding the receptionists & clearly, no one is ever interested. Absolutely mortifying, 100% worse than cold calling, which you also do. There are no real leads given. I was provided 1 piece of paper & every # on it was disconnected.
scam, cold calling, no compensation
none it was all can not complain
Red flags everywhere... What kind of insurance company does not insure their own employees? No health insurance, no training pay, no cell phone or gas allowance, no retirement, no base pay, and no discounts on the supplemental insurance they do offer. The training period is 8 weeks, I found this very excessive, especially if you have any type of business degree. The information presented in training is not helpful and is very basic. Be warned that when in training any sale you close a portion (of the trainer's choosing, varies depending on who they stick you with that day) of your commission goes to the trainer. This means one day you could be asked to share 2/3 of the commission and others 1/3. You aren't allowed to close sales in training, you do all of the work and at the close someone else gets paid for the sake of formality. Aflac does not provide any of these leads, you provide them for Aflac. I never understood why the W-2 worker who was training me (the apparently self-employed) needed a portion of the little money I worked for in training. I did the research, I got the lead, I gave the pitch, I closed the sale, yet my ""trainer"" got to take a piece of my cake. I felt deceived in the interviews (I had two) as I asked what benefits I would be receiving and I was told I would be getting the whole nine yards. This was not the truth, the truth was revealed to me in onboarding after I invested about three hundred dollars into starting with Aflac. This company is not transparent and is very good at deflecting questions. This company claims to be extremely ethical yet every associate I knew had to purchase multiple plans from Aflac just to meet goals if they fell short. You basically make commission on yourself and owe the company later. This to me seems like an MLM buy-in, I know it technically isn't but this is definitely not ethical. This was not just the seasoned employees who had a bad quarter, no this was also the associates straight out of training who had to meet the criteria for the incentives. By the way, they make you sign a paper stating that the incentives are mandatory, even though they are said to be bonus goals in the interview and onboarding phase. READ EVERYTHING!!! The contacts they make you sign are contradictory and are full of grammatical errors. They also write things in that are different than what you are verbally informed of. The company TX-N Town Hall meetings are terrible. Lasting three hours and not helpful in the slightest. If anyone needs a class in business communication it's these people. They missed the basic concepts in business leadership communication every time. I felt like I was sitting through the Hunger Games. Even though you are ""self-employed"" you are still competing with everyone else (there is more buy-in than just selling a product/being self-employed) Hunger Games style. They portray it as a recognition reading but really it's a who made the executives the most money meeting. Aflac wants you to believe you are just self-employed so they don't have to give you benefits or base pay, however, they work you in ways that only W-2 employees should be. This is just a summary of my experience with Aflac. I would not recommend this company to anyone. They will sell you a dream at any cost, you're not just an employee, you are seen as a customer too. What a waste of time.
NYC management has very little focus on value creation and more on generating powerpoints
Unrealistic production goals No continued education or training as things change
Not enough training. Not selective. Hire everyone
I wish the bonuses were greater, but overall great company.
First 3 months are the hardest because you are building your book of business.
Most managers do not like to train new hires Hard to work with sales coordinator/ hard to get advice/ help even though they take personal calls all day You are a commission employee which with the proper training would not be so bad however that’s no the case here you are on your own( corporate does provide a sales school however that is not with your office manager just corporate managers and not enough support to help you when you are making cold calls/ giving presentations Management can be very harsh on you for not hitting your goal Must have sales experience to be successful here or know a lot do business owners/ know how to network Schedule despite what they say are not flexible they want you to be working 24/7 There really isn’t team bonding opportunity while there are great coworkers to meet you aren’t really given a chance to meet with them unless you can make it to the Christmas party they do or once every couple of years the sales coordinator will run a competition and the top sales representatives can all get together. I would not describe this as a diverse work culture I would not describe this as a positive work culture There are not too many opportunities to move up to become a manager unless someone leaves the manager position which is very unlikely as they in their 30’s and not ready to retire or move to another company. Sometimes they open headquarter position but you have to be with the company for awhile as in 3+ years and possibly have to relocate
Low pay for stresses of the job
Hard work and self management definitely a plus
Continuos change of metrics and quotas
Sometimes the work can be overwhelming
I can't think of any cons.
You must work hard and be patient
Haven't found any yet, it's awesome
Very hard to start closing deals
There are really no cons
You will likely work for some 'supervisors' who are, apparently, in their positions because they checked certain boxes. It's in almost every department, too. Promotions seem to follow this mindset as well. It's quite off-putting to be supervised by persons less intelligent and capable than you.
*They didnt give much work
you have to be a self starter.
No salary.100% commission,although commission is normally always very good
Sometimes people aren’t very friendly when they see a salesperson in their lobby. Wish there wasn’t so much cold calling.
Stressful policyholders ,calls are bk to bk no air space or downtime, pay is a joke especially when you have degrees, multiple handle calls that should be handle by specific depts, can't leave until calls are all clear
If the company cancels their policy early you have to pay Aflac back
you are your own boss, so if you fail... its on you
no work no pay check
There is a performance bonus, which is adored by employees, however, the last few years, it has been on the lower end of the spectrum. Training is like too variable, with your success depending on who is training you. The call center is extremely micro- managed with what seems to be little regard to the work life balance and mental health of representatives. Compared to similar companies, I've come to realize that I'd make a significantly higher entry salary than Im currently making, and I'm a tenured employee.
Faced retaliation for reporting inappropriate comment made in front of a supervisor that wasn't planning on reporting the incident.
its cool comapny really good
Need more resources for success.
Lots of work at times.
-in order to move up, you have to be apart of a clique - performance isn't important as long as you know the right people
no protection of your account base. Once an account is established it can be taken back by Aflac at any time. BE careful
Heavy workload and could be stressful at times as with any job
I am really getting sick of hearing ""Aflac is not a tech company"". No doubt, but they bought a tech company, so they need to learn to adapt as much as we need to learn to adapt to red tape. Our development progress has slowed down tremendously, simply because access to our core infrastructure has been moved to other teams and now what used to take us 15 minutes to fix ourselves takes days or even weeks to fix because of all the bureaucracy.
All commissions, no indoor sales, lots of rejection from uninterested customers. Long hours, lots of calling random people hoping to make a sale , lots of rescheduling because people forget or are not interested
No base pay only commission
only commission based, low guidance, high turnover rate
Promotion pay sucks. They short change internal employees and pay external candidates much more.
Saw some incidents of passive aggression related to racial tensions going on at the time. Some managers are very condescending and demeaning. Another con is the inability to get raises and promotions.
Takes time to build leads and earn income
You have to do a lot of prospecting in order to drive sales.
Can be hard to get the ball rolling, money can be slow at first
100% commission for the role
intermediate period without pay in the beginning as you get started. need buffer cash in bank to begin.
All commission based no base salary.
None that I can think of
The pay is purely commission based and is rather difficult to learn.
Crime rates, e.g., random shootings, burglary, murder extremely high in Columbus. Travel at your own risk - seriously.
No base salary or real stable monetary benefit.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sutherland-Reviews-E25705.htm,"Good organisation, growth opportunity, job security
Everything about it is great.
They walk their talk. Their actions and realistic company culture back up what they say, believe in. Unfortunately, this should be more common in large companies, but I've found it to be rare. A lot of BPO companies (and other industries) will try to portray a great culture and a great approach with their employees, lots of perks. But Sutherland Global does actually carry out what they talk about and they believe in it. If I hadn't been so ill, had to take sick leave because of covid I would still be working there.
I have been working for Sutherland global healthcare services for one year now and I love the job it’s the job I went to school for and the career path I choice my coworkers are friendly and the job is challenging yet interesting.
I don’t think I have ever worked somewhere that the company actually cares for its employees! Sutherland really cares and you would be lucky to apart of the family.
My coworkers made it barely tolerable and even then it wasn’t enough. To be perfectly fair, the training was at least halfway decent.
It is very Easy job
I work with a great group of people.
its a great place to work
Great staff and contracts ok pay
Plenty of support to do your job from administration and co workers alike. No matter what there was always someone to reach out to and help was always asap!
good work environment for learning
good company had a lot of fun time there helping people
Large company with benefits, easy to navigate their website
This company offers Fully Remote Work
Monday-Fridays masters you’ll work is 6pm
Here you are paid biweekly, promotions are easy to come by, training is great, and there is a variety of different work schedules to choose from. I enjoyed having easy access to the different restaurants in the area during lunch.

Fast track to management, should you be interested in that. Managers are typically supportive. The benefits were pretty good.
People can be friendly and a lot of remote work.
Remote work. Good pay. Plenty of freedom.
People can be great the Associate advocate team is amazing
Work from home Manager I had for my two programs were lifesavers and made me stay until the programs ended.
The work from home setting is good. Saving on gas with no commute. You have an opportunity to earn a bonus every other month if you meet metrics. If you get a good manager they can be understanding Do offer various scheduling Some programs closed on weekends and Holidays

Nothing at all whatsoever i mean it.
Their pay range, depending on the line of business or project that you are working on, will vary. It's a little lower than other similar companies. I started at 13.00hr, in 2019, the LOB was DirecTV and AT&t, as a Retention Specialist, then a lead. But the many perks, privileges, discounts and benefits made it far worth it, over time. And although the Las Vegas offices phased into completely WFH (I think, not sure 100%) it's still a good culture, no commute costs and home office, equipment perks as well, depending on what works for you.
I don’t have a con for the job honestly the work can be hard at times but overall it’s a good place to work.
I guess if I had to choose it would be that the pay is a little low.
The pay, management, upper management, the customers, the culture, HR, how stressful it was. You’re constantly demeaned by “leadership” when they themselves couldn’t give a flying f- The benefits were abysmal and god for bid you use PTO that you EARNED. What a dump. Last I checked, they were closed. Good riddance.
People Not always 100% ethics
Processes need to be more streamlined. This is relatively a new program. Still have some links that need to be worked out. I'm a top sales performer. In addition to hourly pay, I earn approximately an extra 800. a month in bonuses.
great experience to work here
Supervisors need some work in upper management but regular management is great
Pay for the work was below average
demanding work environmnet, very pressuring.
nothing seems to be bad
No employer matched 401k Health insurance too expensive
Sutherland's CEO does not adequately fund Marketing and changes his mind on strategy, quarterly. There is no marketing career path at this organization.
The pay was way too low
Working at night, sometimes the customers are rude but it is because they have been lied to in the past.
Goals are a lot of the times unrealistic
average pay, lack of transparency
The customer are sometimes mean
I don't like being micro managed.
Not much learnings but if you work hard it is good
Have to keep up with constant change!
Not much bad to put
They will force promote you to another role without notice and pay.
I enjoyed working for Sutherland
the location of the company is not too good
There was a lot of managerial shuffling and restructuring around the the time I left. That's not always a bad thing but at prior jobs, for me personally, it was.
Terrible management, company lacks structure and processes; colleagues are nonresponsive and uncooperative in context where you rely on them to provide information to complete tasks; corporate environment is unfriendly and disconnected.
nothing you can say about sutherland
Racists and sexists unless you suck up to be promoted or if your expertise is too advanced they will promote to use your knowledge and skills.
Impossible to move to another program
Low pay, poor management, poor training
The worst overtime - Cant refuse overtime
High turnover, high call volume, lack of support from management, and no work and home life balance.
Can get laid off at any time Many companies want to actively watch you work Will try to make you do 'manager' or 'trainer' level work with no increase in pay Different programs have wildly different management
Unclear expectations. Lack of transparency. Conflicting guidance, changing rapidly. Increasing sales goals while the sales platform went down regularly. Constantly moving the goal post, while not improving or repairing the platform, making success more and more difficult.
Deceptive recruiting and dishonesty regarding pay structure and potential earnings. They don’t pay the insurance agents any type of commission and the bonus structure is obnoxious to say the least. If you try to leave they threaten you with a large amount being charged to you. The benefits are really expensive starting this years and aren’t even close to how good they were last year, AND they were much less expensive last year.
This is a wonderful company!
deceptive hours of shift availability. Weekend availability does not mean ""weekend mandatory"". Hurried interview process. Changed training without telling the group of trainees and then ""graciously allowed"" the trainees to keep the 6 week training schedule they were promised.
Last job I had that featured chat lasted for a whopping four months. Visible decides that Sykes is better to keep despite them always providing incorrect information and lacks consistency. Meanwhile PlayStation is way too strict on their policies especially when consumers are so rude and think they’re entitled to refunds because of what happened with Cyberpunk 2077’s launch.
The call flow can be heavy and they need to raise the pay for that. The call que for my program has gone up to 800+ and there's only around 200 agents to handle that call flow all day. Either pay more or hire more people. See no opportunities for advancement offered or explained how to get to them. Depending on the program you get for customer service the metrics leave almost no margin for error,but with that type of call load its hard not to make errors. Had to use PTO recently when Holiday pay should have been offered because Holiday fell on weekend. Recently took away option for OT. Training doesn't always line up with policy and updates to policy don't come in a timely enough manner. The calls are graded and sometimes you won't know until you've been graded a 0 (I've just seen this in my program can't speak for others)
nothing you can say about sutherland
Potential to burn out High pressure Minimal advancement
The worst overtime - Cant refuse overtime
everything that has to do with the job
You're told different things by different managers, constantly (including length of training) They change your schedule at the drop of a hat. No one knows what's going on (management wise) managers in training are helping agents in training, which doesn't seem right. miserable. They update their platform constantly, but not the tests, so they will update the information for you to take a test... and you fail because the info has been updated.
This is a wonderful company!
● Low pay. This depends almost entirely on the vertical. Some verticals use ""bonus opportunity"" as an excuse for stifling pay, with the bonus requirements being restrictive and often hard to meet. The bonuses are low as well and only bring total wages earned up to ""slightly"" livable. ● High stress. Most of this, again, depends on the vertical since that influences which customers will be calling. Management tends to be understanding but ultimately this doesn't help much in day-to-day situations. ● Limited opportunity for transfer or career advancement. ● Overall, not worth the time for anyone beyond students or people in need of temporary work. Not great for a long-term career.
Job can be monotonous being that you are on the phone all day.
They want you on the camera all time
Nothing bad to add. Will apply again
Company Do not match 401k
Some micromanagement. To be expected when you're remote sometimes.

IT issues, constant IT issues. The pressure to perform while also dealing with near daily tech issues is overwhelming. When combined with some of the meanest and nastiest customers you may ever deal with anywhere the whole idea of a happy workplace gets thrown to the wayside. AT&T's policy of basically allowing a customer to say anything they please to an agent without repercussion is ridiculous.

Experience is extremely varied and you will never be able to tell if you are landing somewhere good or absolutely abysmal. I had one of the best jobs I could possibly have, until my campaign ended, and I landed in one of the most poorly-managed campaigns I'd ever had the displeasure of even knowing about. The ability to endure an unstable environment is a must-have quality to work here.

The entire rest of it. Bidding for schedules, constant micromanaging, beratement from both customers and management
Computers were terrible and 3/10 people needed new equip in my training class, the management was not supportive/confusing, expectations were ridiculous. Bathroom breaks publicly scolded, calls were to be answered in 5s or public callout, the callers were angry/unreasonable and usually had to give coupons/free money to get them to stop yelling...lots of scams
Boss Manager Food Environment Communication
They don’t care about your mental health at all.
No room for a raise
As a smaller player in the market it requires effort and innovation to ensure we set ourselves apart.
People were there for more than 2 years with no promotions
Pay good be better for the amount of work you do
It has no cons to me
The company could be ran a little smoother. The Hr Manager is amazing and the cute director is hands on. The other leadership outside of the office is not hands on and are not very involved and don’t incorporate changes needed to improve employee experiences.

In the summer time we have what's called ""summer hours"". Work a 9 hour day Monday through Thursday, and then on Friday we out of work by 10am. The workload to pay ratio is actually really good. Its a hard place to work and not gain weight. They feed you all the time. The people are pretty awesome here. Always super friendly, professional and Happy! I've known people to take pay cuts to be able to work in the building I do because the work/life balance is just amazing. Overtime isn't always guaranteed, but when it is its on a volunteer bases. This is the first job in my field that I have had and working weekends was not required or where I don't constantly feel stressed out.
Work-life balance (hybrid) Good benefits and 401K Match Career Opportunities Diversity & Inclusion Smart, nice people to work with
Excellent benefits, generally good work life balance, great flexibility and highly intelligent and motivated coworkers
Company car, vacation, sick time
Pay used to be a pro... Not so much anymore
Lots of real estate to hide when you are forced with no option but to act exactly the same as a fully unqualified epically lazy and downright dangerous partner for years doing 80% of the required work as your supervisors are eyewitnesses to everything but do nothing because ultimately the job get completed.
-good benefits -good colleagues -decent employee retention
","Onboarding is not really good you have to figure it out and advocate for yourself
HR more concerned about moving forward, than rectifying issues When you return from maternity/paternity leave, you will likely be moved to a different role than when you left (not the best time to be moved...)
Job is not necessarily challenging
Younger employees job hops every 12 months within the organization which leads to inexperience and knowledge gaps. Need to have longer requirements for time in role. Constant turnover. Workload can be daunting at times.
Forced overtime (1-3 days per week). Nobody gets weekends off...except management.
Navigating the org can be tricky relationally
no complaints at my time during work
Leadership is stagnant, same outdated thoughts
Very corporate there is a manager for everything
There's occasionally a late night or last-minute travel needed, but it's rare.
Leadership is stagnant, same outdated thoughts
Slow growth industry Limited international business
Poor management, 7 days a week, very little time off. Complete indifference towards people getting burnt out, poor work ethic has zero repercussions, good work ethic is rewarded with the opportunity to cover others lack of discipline.

-commercial freezer - lots of baking - storage unit - no hybrid office - isolating
could give out longer breaks
Favoritism, certain employees get treated better, but every department is different
there is alot of training
There is nothing to complain about
Subject to changes in consumer sentiment
Some politics like all big companies
Given that there are so many people at headquarters, you can get lost and just become a number. That's why it's so important to do all you can to stand out and perform at 100% or higher! Some young people coming right out of college will disrespect the support staff, like the administration or IT people thinking they are better than everyone else cause they got recruiter and they are just out from a prestigious college! I would suggest that Their mentors and/or HR reminds them that everyone deserves Respect and to treat everyone equally no matter what their title is!
Not really a con, but food is a very competitive environment that becomes more and more challenging every year. Changes in work force post covid makes hiring and retention a challenge.
there is alot of training
There is nothing to complain about
Subject to changes in consumer sentiment
Took a long time to make changes
Hard work alot of computer skills used and labor work .
Little room for growth in small team

Toxic culture. Leadership is full of gossipers. They find ways to not give you a fair raise. Completely toxic

I have seen the IT division shrink year after year displacing plenty of good coders and workers. Any custom applicaitons are handed off to those not experienced enough to support the applicaitons causing issues when they go down. Pay was less than average.
Challenging customers, turn over between teams can be high
Stressful, sometimes cuts too deep and can be super slow to manage put poor performers
It was low pay. So I felt I needed a job with more advances.
Can be long hours and a lot of overtime
Management is not pleasant on overnights and everyone starts on overnights.
Shift Restructure every couple of years Expectation level is to be perfect Very very corporate
Company culture has drastically changed since 2020.
The hours and weird schedules
There were not really any cons.
Cold Minnesota winters, but summer are great!

It can be tough to get your foot in the door.
People can become dependent upon each other
Nothing bad to say at all
If your not skilled at retail sales you might struggle with this role
Hours are bad and typical factory noise
12 hour shifts. Very long hours to be standing.
Being a machine handler is a challenge
Advancement in the company is lacking
None I can think of
Monotonous work. Some poor leadership at times.
Limited relocation opportunities, mostly Minnesota based jobs
Lots of churn , new bosses and coworkers and constant movement. No manager training program, learn on the fly and hope for a boss that can teach you what's needed and how to deliver.
So much power point, lots of over performers, not a lot of upward mobility
Good overall, no complaints or negatives
Operations management is overly demanding and has unreasonable expectations. They are willing to ambush you with HR meetings and level baseless accusations to scare you into complying with all expectationswhether they are a part of your job description or not. The leadership changes constantly and the best managers leave to go elsewhere.
Work 6 12 hour shift a week
More outside-in perspective would be helpful at times.
If you did not grow up with the company then you are not welcome for the future
Promotions through time in role, limited advancement based off current rank not potential
Pay, medical benefits getting worse instead of better
Hours are bad and typical factory noise
Schedule can be brutal and unforgiving
If you are not cautious an alleged mechanic here who's daddy got him into a better previous job he destroyed singlehandedly and nearly killed no less than three partners with the initials b.s. will fabricate lies about you as well as the dozen other coworkers he's cordial to up close and personal, claims he's 100% union and walks directly into the office and fills out paperwork certifying he saw you doing something for no reason whatsoever.
-no commission -limited scope -lacking real cultural/DEI connection
Advancement in the company is lacking
None I can think of
Lack of role growth in same department
You live at the plant
Took a page out of the GE playbook to rank employees against each other and cut the bottom 10% every few years. While this isn't formally declared, it is the reality. This regular ""calibration"" process is unpleasant at best, and inhumane at worst. It is sad to see decent people fall victim to a soul-less corporate practice. Outside of calibration time, it is a fun place to work. During calibration times (twice/year), you are reminded that you are really just a number after all.
Very, very few days off. Usually I’m asked if I want a day off the day of it. Stressful, they cut every corner at the laborer’s expense. It is clear and cut that you are just a number.
Pay scale may not be as high but other things definitely make up for that
Up and out culture created lots of gossip
Not much to complain about, but with any workplace there's always room for improvement. For starters, Its almost a penalty for being a Rockstar at your job. Your boss will love you a little to much and never will be willing to let you go. So trying to move into another position can be challenging. In addition, they have this 2 year policy here where you cant change positions before that point. To be fairly honest, I wasn't crazy about the position I accepted, but I did so out of hopes another position I was looking for would open up. After working here a year, the exact position I wanted opened up but was turned away because my manager said he couldn't loose me and I was still in my 2 year timeframe. The position came and went, leaving me wondering what now? The pay is kinda below market values, raises are not great usually 2% Bonuses are based on company and performance. Sometimes there great sometimes there not. But like I said if you factor the work/life balance and what you actually do here.. it really isn't bad pay. On the job training here does not exsist. The first couple months is usually a more senior employee showing the ropes but after that your on your own.
Lower pay than other major companies
Titles and pay sometimes below other large companies
Pay, medical benefits getting worse instead of better

Great work/life balance, benefits, people are friendly and caring. Not like the big universities on the coasts, where bad behavior is tolerated and often rewarded.
Beautiful campus, progressive administration and oversight, clients are almost across the board kind and patient. Management in the IT field of my portion of campus support is second to none. Helpful, team-based community of tech experts from end user support to back end administrators.
Guaranteed a source of pay.
Great place to work. Great people. Great environment.
A renowned leading research university with terrific faculty. Exciting research. Best Engineering and CS in the world imho, but almost anyone would say top five at least. Large. Set in the middle of twin towns with great food, drink, culture, street life, etc. Great schools and very low cost of living (especially real estate). Extremely international student body and faculty.
Initially the benefit package, ability to have holidays/weekends off and take advantage of educational benefits were great. Health insurance is a huge pro as it is one of the best around.
Good experience Helpful coworkers Upwards mobility
Lots of gifted time off around the holidays, as well a lots of campus holidays where you do not need to use PTO.

There are a lot of supportive staff for education work at U of I, but education work is always at the mercy of grant funding unless you can land institution funds.
great benefits for vacation and sick leave
Being able to assist in research that directly benefited the local community and seeing the outcomes as opposed to just the data behind the scenes was a unique and valued experience as a research assistant for the university. The faculty of professors in the school I worked in were so passionate about passing on their knowledge and making every member of a research team feel valued and a part of something.
Allowed me the opportunity to train and become familiar with clinical best practices and laboratory environments.

Great work environment, passionate people, collaborative and light-hearted. All the people there are genuine.
It was great. No issues
flexible hours strong influence on area of work
","The area has many of the cons of an urban area without the pros
The administrative structure is good in some ways, but mushrooming and sucking up so much of the $$$$$ that it is destroying the life of the university. This keeps wages stagnant in most parts of the university and the only way to advance is to jump from job to job to get fair increases in salary. This is sad. The administration loves to hire outside consultants to tell them what is obvious to the people on the ground. Also, getting outside vendors to do the same work the staff are doing, but at a tremendous markup. People in authority like to show off their new apps and change the names of things to keep up with what everyone else is doing. If you don't pay attention to this, you'll be happier there (my mistake), but you won't get ahead.
Parking is notoriously difficult and can be quite costly, even with an exceptional bus system. Finances and bureaucracy are occasional headaches, and the political aspect becomes more intense the higher the position (in my limited experience and observations). Things at UIUC move, as an informal rule, very slowly, for better or worse.
Students can sometimes take 10+ years to graduate (rare, but happens with relative frequency)
I have not identified a con yet.
Too hard to get to Chicago; we need a bullet train, or at least an Acela. Although airport is very convenient, it has too few flights; frustrating. The Illinois regional state universities are weak or weakening which will create problems if the state puts pressure on UIUC to be more vocationally oriented or more focused on Illinois resident undergraduates. The regionals need to be strengthened so that this doesn't happen.
Non communicative leadership on questions that are relevant to daily operations along with the standards being changed on what almost seems to be each semester, and not in a positive way.
Very low pay Variability depending on what lab you're in
It can be tricky to move up. As with lots of universities, there is a decent amount of bureaucracy.
Must find a cover if you cannot make a shift.
None none none none none
Unfortunately they don't have great food
Everything is perfect. Work hard in the research.
pay is not that great, if you wanna the healthcare benefit then it is a good choice
The pay is not high
Work hours can be tough sometimes
Low salary for research assistants.

Non communicative leadership on questions that are relevant to daily operations along with the standards being changed on what almost seems to be each semester, and not in a positive way.
Doing work for the school as a student can be okay, but just be sure it's actually relevant to what you want to do afterwards. work experience isnt only good.
Pay is lower than other jobs on campus
the winter there is cold
It is far away from major city
nothing much to do around here
I just started so no comment on this
Minimal opportunities for professional growth; salary increases not sufficient to cover inflation and increase in cost of living
Pay sucks and you work a lot
So far I didn't see any downside being a Teaching assistant in this school.
You will be surrounded by corn
There are vey high expectations, which can lead to a stressful environment. I think the department could benefit by working on their management and listening to the needs of the students more routinely.
No major cons as long as you communicate with your professor and the department
Nothing at all to complain about
Underpaid Research could get delayed.
Cannot work remotely; low pay
the pay was pretty low
Graduate role with low salary for experienced and highly technical work.
Salary, pay transparency, terrible management
None to state here at this time
- Difficult and tedious tasks
Some aren't and make you work 9-9-6
low pay and potentially long hours
Part-time and focused on student growth. Less about getting job experience
long hours, low pay, stress
Confusing training because you can work multiple very different positions with no training, Some staff seem like they don’t want to be there
Some downsides would be that sometimes you have to work late night shifts since the front desk is open 24hrs (some locations). And the employment interview process can be competitive.
Government job - salary increases are hard to come by
late nights at least for me cause I have day classes
Not fall view of career pathway.
There is limited opporunity for growth for staff. They are not involved big decision making. If they are, there is no accoutability of working groups and recommendations from staff members are often reviewed but nothing is done with it. Staff need to be very clear with their boundaries otherwise university will take advantage of them and ask more than is in their job description.
the pay was pretty low
Being on the macro-level, research side of the field then moving on into clinical, direct work is a difficult transition. Being in research and academia as a whole feels empowering and hopeful and then getting out of that realm can feel a lot less hopeful and less potential for change.
Graduate role with low salary for experienced and highly technical work.
Not too many industries opportunities here.
Salary, pay transparency, terrible management
Location - it is in the middle of nowhere
Small incremental raises each year.
Some aren't and make you work 9-9-6
Dress code - I understand the professionalism they want to convey but it's a gym, it seems a little counterproductive and against the overall environment to wear jeans or cargo shorts year around, athletic shorts and sweatpants should be allowed to be worn in my opinion
long hours, low pay, stress
There are not many cons. I have had only positive experiences here.
No room for growth, very low salary and no salary increases
I was offered a useless health insurance leaving my family with no coverage for the first year of my postdoc because they claimed I hadn't reached residency status in the US which will require you to have been in the US for at least 5 years. When I left after three years they withdrew their employee contribution to my 401K so I was left with nothing.
Some research groups are toxic Urbana - Champaign doesn't have lots of outdoors things I wish we got better raise
No room to move up
Everything else, the university entirely relies on this labor to function
Can be very busy at the beginning of each semester.
- Depending on who you're Teaching Assistant is (pretty much your manager) you're experience will either be great or annoying. At worst they are condescending and treat you like a child, at best they acknowledge that you're an adult and communicate with you as such. - Deadlines are very odd, including weekends and at night, but this is common for graders at the University level, just be mentally prepared.
Law school could have been closer to campus
The pay is small compared to other jobs A limited role
not much flexibility and chances to do own work
There are no cons for this specific job.
Small town living and as a result, the salaries may seen low
bad location,salary is not good
Nothing much as cons though

The Champaign-Urbana area is boring
best company have ever worked
Kind of in the middle of nowhere
- Loooooots of rules - Pay is almost enough to live on, but not quite - Tuition waiver is limited depending on the field you are entering
Not really a big problem, but sometimes the access cards don't work well enough.
Lots of R1 politics Often competitive over collaborative
not much flexibility and chances to do own work
There are no cons for this specific job.
Stressful, competitive, and a small town so if you like city life then this is not for you.
Nothing much as cons though
Senior leadership is incompetent and beholden to special interests at the expense of students and faculty of color who dare to criticize foreign nations who oppress their citizens. Staff in some divisions are grossly underpaid and overworked, whereas others make a fortune for doing less of the same work. Men in leadership (with the departure of the most recent Provost) ignore women with expertise in areas about which the men are woefully ignorant.

I absolutely LOVED working for the pediatrics office location I originally hired with. I was respected, absolutely adored the families I was assigned to, and felt very fulfilled with my position UNTIL I suffered a work related injury in 2015, where I broke my back in 4 places. After taking FMLA and being cleared to return to work, suddenly I was told they had no shifts open, knowing the families I previously worked with were waiting for my return. This in turn caused me to seek out work with the adult office in the same region. The office staff were always having private expensive outings and secret lunches/parties. No Bayada bucks, didn't follow policy that states how to pay field workers for unstaffed shifts, call outs, or emergencies. Despite years of dedication to the company and community, staffing would force dangerous amount of hours on to you, by threatening not to give you any hours at all, jeopardizing your ability to maintain your health insurance. After having a major operation, I returned to work and told that if i didnt work two back to back very long shifts, well over 20 hours within a 24 hour period of time. I attempted to call out, but was told I would be written up if I didnt complete these shifts. The office manager who was later fired for misconduct, wrote me up and let me go. THE WORST PART WAS BEING TOLD I COULD NEVER WORK FOR BAYADA AGAIN. To this day, I still am seriously hurt beyond belief that I could never work for BAYADA ever again. I truly loved my job with BAYADA.
Meeting and helping families in my community
Overhead company walks and talks a true message of caring for people.
Very flexible schedule and pick where you work
Bayada goes out of its way to treat both its clients and employees with compassion. I love my job and continue to look forward to working with Bayada every day.
The company has a fantastic culture where friendly people try to make you feel at home. The work is very impactful.
Managerial Support On the Job training Many available jobs Good co-workers Flexible schedules
Love making a difference in my clients lives. Supportive and helpful team.
Maui office staff and field staff are wonderful. As all nursing jobs, still have to put your foot down if get too overwhelmed Patients treat you like family Best support ever received as a nurse giving direct patient care Best supervisor and director ever: not only in nursing but other careers included
nice people, collaborative work, ops is clueless in SNU
BAYADA is a company where culture, people and a strong mission is extremely important. Everyone that works here has a common denominator, we all CARE and we all LOVE what we do!
Helping families is rewarding. Weekly pay.
-Management teams are supportive and always looking to better you -Great coworkers/teams -Culture is top notch, BAYADA delivers and promises on everything culture based -Generous PTO/Sick time
Bayada has teams that are committed to helping people. The office I work with has a real team feel and the office staff try to help the caregivers in the homes as much as possible.
Employee and Client first mentality
- autonomy - lots of support from mentors - good blend of being in office/WFH/Field
flexible hours on site training pick your own hours
Compassionate office staff, always willing to go above and beyond for nurses and also clients. They take the time to talk to you and figure out how to solve a problem. Just LOVE all of them in the office!!
I have the support of my immediate supervisor and mentor when I have a question or don't understand something. My supervisor spent five days with me via Zoom. I work remotely but this time was well spent as I learned how to do different aspects of my job which will help me be a better collector
BAYADA is a company that not only has a mission and values, but actually focuses on, and uses them! The BAYADA Way is often referenced and used in our daily work, its truly a characteristic of the Company and the employees.
Everyone trained on soft skills to provide constructive feedback, is a company that celebrates its people at all levels.
Very nice managers and great clients
Great coworkers and managers Support of clients Interdisciplinary team Flexibility
Clients are great to work with.
Like a lot of people I was furloughed and treated terribly during the pandemic. they lied over and over again about rehiring me and I lost so much money as a result. They are now coming back to recruit me. I can't believe it. They are full of it.
Independence Good communication Good schedule

I absolutely LOVED working for the pediatrics office location I originally hired with. I was respected, absolutely adored the families I was assigned to, and felt very fulfilled with my position UNTIL I suffered a work related injury in 2015, where I broke my back in 4 places. After taking FMLA and being cleared to return to work, suddenly I was told they had no shifts open, knowing the families I previously worked with were waiting for my return. This in turn caused me to seek out work with the adult office in the same region. The office staff were always having private expensive outings and secret lunches/parties. No Bayada bucks, didn't follow policy that states how to pay field workers for unstaffed shifts, call outs, or emergencies. Despite years of dedication to the company and community, staffing would force dangerous amount of hours on to you, by threatening not to give you any hours at all, jeopardizing your ability to maintain your health insurance. After having a major operation, I returned to work and told that if i didnt work two back to back very long shifts, well over 20 hours within a 24 hour period of time. I attempted to call out, but was told I would be written up if I didnt complete these shifts. The office manager who was later fired for misconduct, wrote me up and let me go. THE WORST PART WAS BEING TOLD I COULD NEVER WORK FOR BAYADA AGAIN. To this day, I still am seriously hurt beyond belief that I could never work for BAYADA ever again. I truly loved my job with BAYADA.
","There aren’t any cons so far
None at all. Great place to work
I’ve had an experience with Bayada that left me deeply concerned about their priorities. It's evident that this company places a higher value on their bottom line than on the well-being of both their employees and the families they impact. One of the most glaring issues is the company's disregard for work-life balance. Employees are constantly expected to work long hours, often sacrificing valuable time with their families due to Bayada being unable to keep adequate staffing . This not only affects the mental and physical health of employees but also puts undue strain on family relationships. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive benefits for employees and their families is disappointing. Health insurance plans are often inadequate, making it difficult for employees to access the healthcare they need, let alone their family members. This neglect of the overall welfare of their workforce reflects a lack of genuine care. Furthermore, Bayada seems to prioritize cost-cutting measures at the expense of employee satisfaction. Office layoffs and downsizing are frequent occurrences, causing job insecurity and anxiety among the workforce. It's disheartening to see how little consideration is given to the livelihoods of the very people who drive the company's success. In conclusion, it's evident that Bayada prioritizes profit margins over the well-being of both employees annd families. This profit-driven mindset is detrimental not only to the individuals involved but also to the company's long-term sustainability. It's high time they reevaluate their values and begin placing the welfare of their employees and families at the forefront of their priorities.
Poor communication, ineffective leadership and unclear expectations are apparently the Bayada way. Based on their statements, I really expected an organization that would set the standard of excellence in home care. I was completely wrong.
Where to begin? First of all, no one took the time to understand the PHX market and what is involved to become a preferred provider in the hospital and skilled settings. Does not have a presence in any of the ACO's but still expected to get referrals from hospitals. VERY UNREALISTIC sales goals. The ramp up process is reasonable, but once you have been with the company for 6 months the goals become unattainable and you will be put on a PIP. It seems as if the objective is to make the goal so unreasonable that they can terminate you after a year (which if you look at the trail of marketing managers in the Phoenix area who have worked for BAYADA most only last around a year before they are replaced)
I’ve been employed by Bayada for several months in the nurse residency program. I’ve worked with four different nurses over several weeks learning how to be a home health nurse. After weeks of training with a nurse I ask what single piece of advice can they give me before I start working on my own. All of them have told me to get away from Bayada. They tell me how awful Bayada is as an employer and how I deserve better. They are also currently looking for a different job. My plan is to leave Bayada ASAP when my contract is up. I worked part time at a retail store while in nursing school and got better vacation time and health insurance. Can you believe Bayada doesn’t offer sick time?
BAYADA continues to drift from its self-professed key values. Compassion, Excellence, and Reliability are values that all companies should uphold. In the past years BAYADA has drifted from these values, hiring and internally promoting individuals who do not exhibit the BAYADA Way core values. It's not uncommon to be talked down to or thrown under the bus by new hires in positions or power or individuals with known behavioral issues who have been somehow fast-tracked up the management track. BAYADA seems to cry poor mouth when it comes to COLAs for employees or providing half-way decent benefits and yet somehow finds the money to pay its executive teams over $10,000,000 annually. BAYADA is constantly expanding while tightening budgets. It isn't uncommon to have a Division Director who has no idea who you are, what you do, or how critical your job functions are, with them instead delegating those responsibilities to an ever-growing army of middle management while raking in multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. The culture was one of the few things that made BAYADA a competitive employer. Without it, what's the point?
Same starting pay rate for over 10 years. No difference in pay rate based off of experience (20 years experience or 20 months, same starting pay). PTO is only earned for every 2000 hours worked and is prorated at the time your worked in previous 12 months (so if you take any time off, you get less than your true commitment to the company of working X amount of hours per week). No sick pay for field staff, but you can purchase AFLAC on your own if you want. Case Managers and Client Services Managers get better benefits and only have to work M-F. Field staff are the ones that get Bayada billable hours, yet we get the least amount of compensation. Office staff and management make money off our backs. This is a multimillion dollar company that only became ""nonprofit"" after banking millions as a for profit company. The only reason most nurses stay on is their compassion to the clients we take care of and management knows this and manipulates us with fake quarterly surveys that are for show only, never any true resolutions to augment field staff. Raises are a joke, you get the same raise as other field staff who choose to not work weekends, not work holidays, not work off shifts, not work for open shifts, etc. Don't break your back or give up family time thinking you will get noticed and compensated for it.
The local office and the corporate office is suppose to share the same beliefs but this isn’t the case. No matter how much the local offices try to change for the better, the corporate office will not allow it. Local offices are at a breaking point staffing wise. Corporate office’s only concern is money. Our office has had to furlough several office positions due to costs but the CEO’s salary has increased hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for the past several years straight. CEO has received over a million dollar pay increase in past two years. Meanwhile, Bayada morale is at its lowest I’ve ever seen in my decade of working for Bayada. We need new leadership! One that lives by the Bayada beliefs that “Our employees are our greatest asset.” We need a leader with more qualifications than just sharing the same last name as the company founder.
They suck at schedules. They would schedule me to work days I requested off or while I was on vacation. I asked for a specific schedule with one of my clients and they don’t keep up with their promises. Hourly pay sucks for what you have to do plus raises are rare but you get “Bayada bucks” for picking up certain shifts to buy stuff online. They also change your schedule without notice and you have to check it multiple times a week.
In North Carolina, several Bayada offices have closed due to office staff quitting. Directors and CSMs quit and they have to shut the office down. Word of mouth has gotten out how terrible Bayada has become under new CEO and no one wants to work for Bayada anymore. This was the case for my office over a year ago. All the cases with my original office were transfered to the Charlotte office. I’ve been part of the Charlotte office over a year and have no idea who the office director is due to the lack of communication. My old office would send weekly emails. Charlotte office doesn’t communicate at all other than through the Bayada app asking for nurses to cover school nurse call outs. If you email office CSM you will not get a reply. If you message office in app, you may get a reply in 1-3 days. How can nurses work effectively without communication? I’m not blaming office staff. I blame the leadership, or the lack of leadership, above the office level. Charlotte Pediatric Office staff seem to be overworked to the max.
little opportunity for upward mobility, high staff turnover.
Overall pay for Client Services Manager role is low compared to other positions within the company that are non-managerial roles. CSMs should be paid more for the front facing role and their contribution to the offices.
Pay is the lowest in the industry. Besides the pay I have nothing negative to say about the company and the people.
Salary is not a livable salary and the work load is extremely high. The turn over rate for our dept is extremely high ! People are promoted into managerial roles with zero managerial experience.
It seems it is a culture at the Hilo office for the scheduling manager to tell you she will get back by the end and does not. Additionally, client sessions will be canceled and the manager will forget to tell notify you. You find out the job is canceled when you get to the job. The benefit package is so horrible it is given to you with comparable benefit packages that are just as bad to help persuade new employees to accept it the poor to mediocre at best benefits.
I got paid $8 per hour with a University degree. I was promised 40+ hrs I barely got 30 even substituting. (Aka being on call 24/7 without on call pay). I was promised a chance at a higher position in 3 months once I signed on but then they hired outside of company the next month without telling anyone. Had me doing lifting I wasn't fully trained or physically capable of. Because they're terrible at aligning needs with best employees. Family expected me to do the same work of someone getting paid $5 more per hour ... family expected me to ENTERTAIN an adult as if they were a child which is unethical and goes against company policy. Family seemed not to understand that I was there to help reach goals not act. And the company would neither back me up nor help me find better placement. When I refused to go back in a home because I felt physically unsafe around an abusive male they said that amounted to me quitting.
Salary could be improved., Annual raises would be nice.
They don't give raises so negotiate on the front end.
Pay isn't a competitive as it was when I started.
Quantity over quality when hiring staff
This company is experiencing rapid growth and with that you always have bumps and bruises. The benefits package could use some help. While there are health benefits and PTO, they could be more generous. There are a lot of meetings - especially for management.
Finding clients that are a good fit can take some time
Pay is low hourly unless you work last minute shifts
Salary is not a livable salary and the work load is extremely high. The turn over rate for our dept is extremely high ! People are promoted into managerial roles with zero managerial experience.
I can't find a con.
Pay Rates below market value
Take a lot of paperwork home
Staffing, management, pushing out clients
The pay is not as great as hospital positions, but because of the flexibility and acuity in care I find their pay rate to be fair and they will increase pay as appropriate.

Right when you think Bayada can’t get any worse. I received a letter wanting me to prove I’m married and my kids are mine. I submitted the necessary paperwork and they denied it and said they are dropping my family’s health insurance. I’ve been married 11 years, my husband has been on my insurance the entire time while working at Bayada. My kids are 8yo and 6yo. They have been on Bayada health insurance their entire life up till now.
I can't find a con.
Pay Rates below market value
Take a lot of paperwork home
Hiring staff was unprofessional, unorganized, distracted. Pay is low. I didn’t get paid for my training session with a nurse which was mandatory.
Terrible leadership! Director refuses to give any pay increases. Terrible PTO. No sick time. No reason to keep working for Bayada.
Staffing, management, pushing out clients
The pay is not as great as hospital positions, but because of the flexibility and acuity in care I find their pay rate to be fair and they will increase pay as appropriate.
could give better vacation time
I recently had my annual review. A overall score of 5.0 is the highest score you can get. 3.0 is average. I received an average of 4.9. Since I haven’t received a pay increase in eight years I used my recent extremely positive review and carefully wrote an email of how I feel I deserve a pay increase. In those eight years Bayada has received four reimbursement increases. I sent the email and had a reply in under five minutes. The reply was “LOL” which is so unprofessional on so many levels. I decided to update my resume and applied somewhere else. I interviewed and was offered $15/hr more than Bayada is paying me. Also offered way more PTO, sick time, bereavement, and much more. I do find it very disappointing that Bayada wouldn’t even give me a pay increase while other companies are willing to offer me so much more.
Benefits and salary are consistent with nonprofit organization compensation.
Salary is less than field nurses that you supervise
Office closing and don't understand why. I am going to loose a part of my family, Don't feel that we and the clients will get the same attention to detail or compassion from the offices that we are being transferred to, Pediatric Offices. They don't understand what all we do in the adult world. Questioning if I would recommend for employment or referral of clients.
the pay could be better
They don’t pay as much as other companies
lost focus on the mission, too top heavy, culture has declined as new c-suite leaders were added
Even though I was full time they didn’t provide consistent cases
No pay increase for 7+ years Working outside of expected hours , poor work life balance Unpaid on call as backup night nurse Working weekends ends up being 7-10 workdays in a row Short staffed No coverage when short staffed On call as needed
Sometimes a client's home may be farther than you want to work.
Charting system is horrible. Worst coding team I ever worked with, although they have been improving
No work from home options. Pay is pathetic.
Training felt a little bit fast, but with my experience I was able to adjust quickly.
I have nothing negative to share.
Pay could be better for nurses
Lower pay for experienced high tech nurses

They have been on Bayada health insurance their entire life up till now.
Like small and large organizations, we are looking for ways to work more efficiently by investing in technology and people resources.
Came from a position in the clinical field that allowed me to make my own schedule - this is a 8:30 - 5 schedule (not a huge deal)
BEING LIED TO ABOUT SHIFTS BEING UNAVAILABLE WHEN WERE COMPLETELY OPEN. FAMILIES CALLING YOU, BEGGING YOU TO COME TO WORK.
Regardless if you have worked for Bayada as a nurse for 30 years or three months. You get the exact same thing. It’s absolutely pointless to work for Bayada long term. Have to work 2000 hours for 40 hours of PTO. No sick time at all. Even during the pandemic. Yet, office staff gets PTO, sick time, and personal day. At five years office staff gets even more time off. Office staff at five years get 31 days off a year while field staff get 5 days for every 2,000 hours you work. Field staff have to work 50 weeks at 40 hours a week for five days of PTO. Field staff gets basically nothing but field staff are the ones making the company money. I would not recommend working at Bayada due to the lack of work/life balance. They will work you to death and claim they have a good work culture. It’s not true!
Separate branch offices can seem chaotic and can seemingly have poor leadership
Not enough pay or raises
Several software platforms used to complete different tasks and retrieve information
Leadership heavy. People are not very aligned on their ultimate goal.
Low pay. No sick days.
Sometimes a client's home may be farther than you want to work.
Charting system is horrible. Worst coding team I ever worked with, although they have been improving
fake, communist, woke, spendthrift, old school
Working in healthcare is challenging, but BAYADA tries overcome some of the challenges by constantly improving and being innovative.

-Moving up in the company takes awhile -**Employees need better health insurance benefits**
I can't think of anything right now.
We need more comprehensive benefits
- office drama - office coworkers not great at communication/teamwork/taking initiative - have to rotate on-call after hours/weekends
The Pay could be better
Office closing and don't understand why. I am going to loose a part of my family, Don't feel that we and the clients will get the same attention to detail or compassion from the offices that we are being transferred to, Pediatric Offices. They don't understand what all we do in the adult world. Questioning if I would recommend for employment or referral of clients.
No leniency with time deadlines as far as benefits.
Large, complex and highly matrixed organization....can be hard to understand the layers and practices. This is not a bad thing, but can be challenging for new hires.
Career opportunities upwards is difficult at this level.
Even though I was full time they didn’t provide consistent cases
No pay increase for 7+ years Working outside of expected hours , poor work life balance Unpaid on call as backup night nurse Working weekends ends up being 7-10 workdays in a row Short staffed No coverage when short staffed On call as needed
Pay and benefits are not great, no bonuses or holiday bonuses.
The website and values are written nice. But they never follow it. The son is very different than the father. Only focused on money and not people. He left us high and dry when we needed it most and does it all the time. What a sham.
Sometimes too much down time Not all houses are clean ect
Compensation is based on reimbursement for in home care, which is not the highest.
Alot of great people to work with
Pay rates/salaries could be better
Sometimes staff can get schedules wrong
Sometimes staff can get schedules wrong
No shortage of work. It can feel siloed sometimes. Working with other offices can sometimes be a challenge.
Pay should scale according to acuity of clients
This company has a cult-like office culture so many layers of management and a constantly rotating door of actual field clinicians who have no back-up licensed supervisors or leadership available for pre-scheduled routine visits when visits extend due to unexpected patient emergencies or needs The pay is HORRIBLE. They pay-per-visit and offer the same initial base pay for all new hires regardless of experience. They will send you out of your assigned geographic area all of the time, making meeting the 5 visit per day expectation near impossible. Ask for $10 more per visit off the bat. Period
Management, Lack of clear expectations
Home health. If pt goes to hospital you are out of work
Disorganized in office, toxic leadership that needs training on home health and how to speak to people, not interested in doing right by the patient rather what can make a higher profit
Price of benefits, sometimes unrealistic pressure to obtain goals
Not the best benefit package

Good culture, overall busy office. The structure is spread out
Good hours, and great benefits
They had great benefits, pay, and opportunity for growth
In a good branch, the work culture is exceptional. KeyBank is a business looking to make money, like any other, but not at the expense of our clients. Some managers and employees can twist that and create a negative experience, but that's with any company.
They more generous on base pay than the average retail bank. Overall, good place to work if you don’t have a bachelor degree or as a first job out of college.

My boss is the only person that cares about his employees. Otherwise it's a lot of corporate BS. You do not want to work there.
-bank hours -helpful co-workers management
","Pay should honestly be a higher
Workload and Stress: The banking industry can be demanding, with high workloads and stressful situations, especially during busy periods or economic challenges. Sales Targets: Many positions in banking, particularly in branches, come with sales targets or quotas. Meeting these targets can be challenging and may lead to pressure to sell products. Competition: Competition for promotions and higher-level positions within a large organization like KeyBank can be fierce, and advancement may require significant effort. Work-Life Balance: Like many financial institutions, KeyBank may require employees to work long hours or irregular schedules, which can impact work-life balance. Customer Challenges: Dealing with difficult customers or handling customer complaints can be a challenging aspect of working in banking. Location Dependency: The availability of career opportunities within KeyBank may be limited to specific geographic regions, so your location can significantly impact your job prospects.
None, I recommend KeyBank as an employer.
Micromanagement can ruin jobs and make people leave along with no upward mobility/advancement in your career.
I worked for Joe Wilgus out of Ohio on the consumer direct side. Be careful of the $7,000.00 sign on guarantee they will ask for it back if you stay for less than a year. They pitch you on a $15.00 an hour salary and lots of leads being sent to you which 50% are service-related calls since the customer service number is the same as the sales inbound line. They also raised rates out of market on Jumbo and also doctor loans all portfolio due to the SVP bank crash in the Silicon Valley. My manager had three years mortgage experience with a bouncer bar tender background. he preferred I asked my teammates for help. They will start you out at $700.00 a closed loan does not matter the size of the loan then after 6 months will be reduced to $300.00 a closed loan / unit and you have to fund three equity lines with a full draw for a unit credit. It's very hard to make over $5,000.00 a month here I have 20 years' experience working leads as a mortgage banker / broker and have never used such terrible out of dated systems by 15 years.
Pay could be better, but this might change in coming years.
Work at the office 1 day a week
I don't have any cons
If you're not used to keeping up with all the regulatory stuff surrounding something like banking, the stress of making a mistake that's much more serious than you expect can be a lot of handle. It does get better with time.
Terrible software that looks like it was built in the 90’s.

Leadership is not clear on goals.
It's easy to get stuck in a specific line of business and be limited in your opportunities to advance your career.
leave after a year, they don't know their head from their rear-end
Starting to lean more towards credit pushing to those that dont need it.
People, meetings, bonus, insurance, recognition
I have nothing to add here
none none none none none
Favoritism, every quarter your IC plan or commission payouts will change to benefit executives and lessen what is paid out. Payroll/Back office will purposely delay certain things on commission payouts, change policies and is not honest about their payout system to bankers and branch managers. Not including absolutely no growth opportunities, and if they are provided they will require you to go through hell to take one step upward.
Lack of Training and opportunities
Some benefits are hard to understand
There's not many cons one can speak on
Having to upswell banking products.
Low pay. Long days and no vacay time since severely understaffed.
They are cheap in every aspect. Salary, supplies , travel to get your job done

Management isn’t great, behind the scale on pay
They are cheap in every aspect. Salary, supplies , travel to get your job done
They have handled return to office EXTREMELY poorly. Management is extremely passive aggressive and won't talk to you in person and only communicates digitally. They promise opportunities for growth but lie and then promote based on politics. Compensation is extremely poor in comparison to peers and there is constant turnover due to this. Management is not trained and just glorified babysitters who are out of touch with employees.
-people don’t answer your questions -quotas are too high -training is inadequate -programs make it difficult to do your job
Management is inconsistent. Many in leadership role are unsuitable for positive work environment. Positions go unfilled and goals are often not met, which affects your pay negatively (bonuses). Favoritism is a HUGE problem. Investment Advisors mostly try to remain hands off, but pressure to perform so they get paid (70% commission for 5% involvement). Employees are unhappy EVERYWHERE. There's an internal board people post on that proves it.
Company restructure eliminated jobs, not considered for different position. Appears you are just a number not a valued employee. Once your department is advised to cut a certain percent, the chosen for elimination are gone and forgotten. Where is the ""chosen one of the best places to work"". This is true until your position is eliminated with NO notice and you are gone.
Majority of cons will depend on your manager or management chain. Favoritism, # of meaningless tasks, too many layers of management, individual thinkers (great leaders) usually don't last long, again it all depends on your direct manager and their past experience.
Pay Rate Promotions Advancement opportunities
No cons. This is a great company
Big goals to meet monthly but doable
bureaucratic; go to market strategy changes too often
Goals are out of reach so they don’t have to pay you much based on even the good months and commission needs reworked.
lack of staffing severely within retail staff
Experience really depends on the location. Often short staffed.
Lots of changes and not always for the better
I am very happy with this company
Reward point to redeem as cash each month.
Short handed large work load
Pay was average. Cube life. Micro manages your work.

Work or on call 24/7 365 days
Dealing with customers and with stat requirements
Training leaves a lot to be desired I have been employed for a year and I am still trying to learn processes and procedures (which keep changing). QCs are not consistent which is frustrating.
Slow Growth No social interaction
Very hard to advance and not much room to negotiate your needs as an employee
too much micromanagement by sr management
Relatively low pay compared to the competition. If you come from a tenured profession outside of the banking industry or debt servicing industry it will not help you in the slightest. You will start from the bottom up.

Goals are changed throughout quarter without communication - its just a surprise. If you work Saturday, you don't get a full day off, but one 1/2 day during the week.
They have terrible pay, benefits, leadership
Not a lot of training was there to fill in gaps of work.
Too many levels of management slows down projects.
not many branches, promotion depending on who likes you.
Work or on call 24/7 365 days
Ask far too much of manager as they are business bankers and branch managers.
Sometimes the goals can be challenging.
Have to be willing to wait for career mobility
poor pay structure makes it hard to succeed
Lack of accountable leadership, and lack of streamlining of rules & regulations. Managers will over-work you for fewer benefits if you do not advocate for yourself. Security never shows up when needed, expect to de-escalate conflict alone if on the front line with clients. Self-research into other banking regulations will be expected, along with busy work, related to training. There will not be allocated time on the job for this and you are expected to cram it in with your workload. Management didn't want to approve any necessary overtime and often played favorites with PTO requests.
Not as organized as you would thinkn
things could get harder and challenging
Difficult to find time to train in other areas as a teller.
A lot of changes in the bank.
Some departments have loose expectations making it challenging to identify your progress ....was easily corrected with open lines of communication with managers.
poor training, poor day to day support
Nothing comes to mind when asked

Technology is outdated as can be, products aren’t best in market
High sales goals with a strong emphasis on driving sales and results. Long periods of dedicated dialing to bring in business. Upper management is very hands on and consistently badgering about sales goals. Expectations vs compensation for role could be better.
Systems are old, benefits aren’t great, turnover, not really supported, you are not only the managers but business sales for the branch, too many ideas from corporate but not enough strategy/thought put into it. Also, not a good workplace for a person of color. You are treated differently.
No support, awful outdated systems

","Sometimes you may have to work overtime but that's a given in the retail world.
Don’t come in trying to bust your butt trying to make changes and get people to do work. It’s a waste of time. It’s retail and you have to accept that they only move when they have to. They are reactive. They have “It’s always been done this way attitude”. See above. Senior management doesn’t really have clear directives for managers beneath them. There needs to be a directive that all departments work together towards. They are so focused on the sales side. Company makes poor financial decisions. They bought a company for millions of dollars who I’ve yet to figure out how it helps them. They are just as expensive. All the while struggling financially. See 150 people laid off in a day or more. They are going to cut so much of their workforce at some point and eventually shoot themselves in the foot since there isn’t any help. Their price point is weird. They are good clothes but sort of fits younger professional niche. There really isn’t much of a market for decent clothes below Express’ cost. They could lower prices or run better deals. People with money can spend slightly more and get higher end brands that fit their look.
Sub standard salary Less growth oppurtunities
Retail life = busy holidays
The pay was not great
Pay could be better, hours could be better
Could be more competitive with pay
- No growth from inside the company - Revolving door of associates - Little to no hours
Cleaning Non flexible hours Short staffed
Once you did a good job they would take advantage of it without attempting to pay you more. Pay raise went up by less than a dollar at times.
Could be more competitive with pay
Management.. it became so bad so fast. Respectfully I'd never ever work under this company again.
- No growth from inside the company - Revolving door of associates - Little to no hours
Minimum wage, weekend shift required
- little to no flexibility in scheduling - 3 strikes, you're out mindset - a lot of work and little pay
Cleaning Non flexible hours Short staffed
Leadership does not care about their bottom line.
They are not afraid to over work managers that are salaried.

I could only work seasonally but they are flexible
Not enough support when needed. Company did not back or support when false allegations were brought forward. Inconsistent consequences
The manager was really strict, didn't really understand boundaries, and also stereotyped customers.
Schedule Hours fluctuate Poor Management Lack of training No growth opportunities
Low wage Discount has excessive limitations
No room for growth without overworking
Leadership changes, inconsistent strategy, losing customers
I was always tempted to stay and work every summer for seasonal or Christmas time. The pay however makes me consider positions because it should be much better than minimum wage.
Pay Terrible management Terrible environment
Low paid, turnover is high.
very, very low pay!! I would still be there if it weren't for the low pay. as a result of low pay across the board, it's difficult to keep stores staffed, therefore increasing the workload and stress levels of store leaders. 2 years since I worked at express and I've doubled my pay and lowered my stress! still in retail
Hard to get a full time position but great if you only want part time
district manager does not do his job very well. Managers are worn out and overworked.
favoritism between managers and employees is a double edge sword.
laziness, no authority, no consistency, management is always changing, company only cares about money, under-staffed, low paid, lower employee discount
Short break times Late nights
Upper management such as regional managers, and general managers don’t realize that for 90% of the people this is a transitional job. Not to mention the below average starting pay.
Late hours Low pay Minimal growth opportunities
high expectations with little reward
Very unprofessional management; multiple times I received little to no guidance during my employment from my employer / supervisor
You had to find your own coverage if you had to call out
bad manager, little hours, uncompetitive pay
I could only work seasonally but they are flexible
Not the best hours in the beginning
I worked for express oxford valley for a few months until an unstable employee seemed to taking a hatred towards me after i told him to go home and rest because he was literally sick and laying with a mask on the register. After that it was two and a half months of hell. I was hit with a trash bag when loading it into the trash compactor, a door slammed in my face, ignored for a 6 hour shift, walked away from when talking to, then finally he showed up and starred at me across the store when he wasnt work. I was extremely uncomfortable after that and my store manager knew all of this was going on. This was not the first time he had problems with people in the store. Customers are complain about him constantly. Finally the night he just showed up, i was scared to walk to my car. I told my manager I did not want to work with him anymore, yet a week later she was asking me to come in on a day off, and i had to again ask her if he was working, he was and it was just going to be me and him in the store. It was my final straw. They lost a good employee, for someone who harasses and is rude to customers and employees and is extremely unstable. ill probably never even shop there again.
The work environment may be too fast-paced
favoritism between managers and employees is a double edge sword.
some difficult customers and slow times at the mall

Very unprofessional management; multiple times I received little to no guidance during my employment from my employer / supervisor
People can be rude and managers can take things too seriously
bad manager, little hours, uncompetitive pay
Store employees gossip constantly about each other, it’s a small store and there’s basically no break room.
Where to begin, management is straight up rude you could be running around working, cleaning, helping customers and management would still find something to complain about. Racist towards certain costumers but that manager no longer works there but it does happen. They constantly update and change return policies and coupons which makes it hard to keep track of especially if your part time. Even worst when no one tells you it. Favorites are obvious women do this alot. Customers when they are not stealing because of the stores being understaffed they try to trick you with returns and are completely and unreasonably rude. Honestly management loves to micro manage and constantly chatter on the ear piece which made it hard to hear what customers wanted. Schedule was all over the place also. Don't sign up for email the company floods you inbox with the same email about deal written 20 different ways.
None to speak of currently
The drama is unbelievable here
Sometimes you may have to work overtime but that's a given in the retail world.
When it came to closing the employees had to do everything when they apparently hired people to do so!
It was very disorganized and understaffed
Pay could be more for employees, especially in the outlets.
district manager does not do his job very well. Managers are worn out and overworked.
Repetitive but still good overall.
Less pay, no bonuses, old tech
Long weekends Long nights Minimum days off
I've been promoted internally and as with all internal promotions... they don't always match the average country/local wages. You do get tons of experience and elevated to roles you'd otherwise not attain so this is not a huge con.
managers were great until the new GM came having to get the email and credit cards is annoying for staff and customers
The work environment may be too fast-paced
- none that I can think of
Long weekend shifts, hard to take take days off
The manager says he fought for me to get paid my hourly rate, which was less than $15 per hour I left the company because I found a job paying more. The manager tried to get me to stay by saying he can match my pay at the new position. I found that to be unfair. Also, hours for cut because they had to train a new manager. The associates and managers were not people friendly. I don't recommend.
Management was terrible at micromanaging you ALL the time, Standing around just to fold clothes are boring, lunch breaks are super short for you to be standing all day and not able to ""lean"" in the workplace ( floor ), dont get enough hours, they play around with your time they know when you arrive and they decide on your break even though it says it on your schedule but they get to dismiss you early if they want to ( thats playing with my money and time ) dress code sucks they say express yourself but only if its in there brand , ohhh and how could i forget the energy in that place is awful
some difficult customers and slow times at the mall
Company doesn't care about employees in store and doesn't pay enough for the level of work they expect.

They will lie on you, use you, and part time employees only get 10-15 hours a week at minimum wage. The company is constantly turning over employees, including managers of all fields.
company is losing money and shifts are getting cut
They were just starting to reorganize everything so it was a little chaotic
None to speak of currently
Rude and disrespectful management, no training, wasn’t paid for multiple days due to their time clock not working, they pay you through a store card that you can’t access without their help!! I contacted HR and they said since it wasn’t documented they couldn’t compensate me. Awful.
they were very unorganized with their store
The drama is unbelievable here

The company is very very good to work for. The co workers and peers you work with are helpful, down to earth and some of the best people you'll ever meet in your life. The managers and seniors are also very understanding and good. The product you work on or develop and the work field (public safety) is also a fun scope of work and really interesting. Benefits are also nice (health insurance, ESP stock plan, 401k, etc)
Motorola Solutions(MSI) has a mission that is deeply impactful and felt throughout the company with sincere passion. MSI comes with strong leadership starting at the top with a CEO who is committed and sincerely authentic and an Executive Committee who is passionate for their people. The culture feels like a team across the whole company, and there are many organizations and leadership opportunities to get involved in within the company. Compensation is competitive with many benefits including unlimited PTO which the company and Sr. leaders (HR and CEO) encourage you to take. The leadership through covid was particularly impressive. Management from every job I have had here has been trusting and given me the opportunity and freedom to grow, work, and bring ideas where I believe real improvement can be made. Lastly, the work-life balance and Young Professionals Group offer great opportunities to grow both personally and professionally for all ages.
I did like working for them, they were very friendly and nice salary.
Forward thinking company that's increasing in value by the day! Decent benefits, and opportunity to travel if desired.

A very kind and welcoming community. Manager allowed me to showcase my full potential which felt very rewarding.
A ton of PTO, solid pay and allows for remote work.
Like many companies, your experience might vary widely based on the team you hire onto. My team is a group of software devs, we get our work done and we're all remote so there's no real drama.
Great people, strong company, good culture

Stock program, competitive pay, quality products/solutions. Company is great, but be cautious depending on which territory you work in. Local management can vary drastically from territory to territory.
Great WLB, good mission, good people
Great place to learn. Great team.
Immediate management and director were fantastic and super supportive.
Amazing manager. Does not micromanage and provide a hybrid schedule. Bagel Fridays
Large, stable company; very flexible in working from home; prioritizes its employees' happiness and wellbeing

MSI invests in its employees, community, and its mission. There are endless amounts of career opportunities, and leadership truly embraces an ""Open Door"" policy. MSI supports multiple business councils and encourages employees to participate in mentorships and volunteer opportunities.
","With it being a global company with now primarily all remote workers, it can be hard to make and keep new connections. Wish more was offered to network with co-workers within the company in person more often.
Sometimes there are too many calls and people to go through.
Salary Conservative / Budgets Employee Appreciation
No cons that I can think of.
The tempo is a bit slow
Downsides are strong short-term revenue focus over long term value often being a preference, lack of alignment between sleeves of org causing inefficiencies. Product management culture definitely has room for improvement
Not the best pay, for what you are doing. Great start in IT in terms of exposure but the pay doesn't keep up with the work
- had to cross the US/Mexico border daily
Lack of relevant training for new employees
Poor work/life balance. Management focuses on fast development rather good dev.
management, business structure, police communication
The new hire training schedule can be arduous at times, however is very the training program informative and easy to follow.
Pay is limited. Perks are limited
I feel pay is low for what we do, for job titles though we are ahead if that makes sense? I would have stayed longer but promotional opportunities were limited for me and I was ready to go make more money.
None that I can think of
Personally I don’t have downsides
Ability to change roles depends on champions and relationships rather than performance. Being in Chicago and in-person is critical for promotions. Mobility and transparency are limited, demotivating employees. Leaving may be better for ambitious individuals outside Chicago. Mission feels insincere, limited urgency for improvement.
one day of training not enough to fully understand several apps, how the different parts of DRN interact, not good training even when requested. Affected by a RIF, which I understand the company does often. A former employee had warned me that might occur., when I mentioned I had accepted a job there.
toxic people, low pay, medical, old systems, lack of communication, always work under pressure
- You can get higher pay at Big Tech companies. If you want to compete with Big Tech salaries you need to move into management. - While mid term prospects for the business are strong, how the company manages the long term radio cliff (if it occurs) is still unclear.
Onboarding process could use uplift. Corporate training was online / virtual with general corporate and industry dos and donts which i found helpful and good info to knkw when joining but unfortunately the Team project I joined provided little to help with the transition to the new role. Organization and clear definition on daily tasks and expectations on your roles and responsibilities was confusing and if not addressed will be a receipe for disaster.
No Cons at this time
Broad portfolio and need to know and utilize your resources.
- Large corporation, will pay the shareholders before you -Pay raises are kind of taboo to talk about - Not the most friendly towards disclosing pay information
I do not have any.
The below average to average compensation could use some work. Not well defined career advancement opportunities.
You are going to be stuck in the role you get hired for unless a miracle happens. Doesn't matter how hard you work.
Very recent obsession with DEI and ESG, within the last year or so. They created a ""language list"" that we need to use and will have to waste time updating documents for ""non inclusive language."" No other coworkers like this or want to do it. At a recent townhall it was mentioned that they have a goal to reduce building energy usage by 95% in the next few years, which seems ridiculous given that we have lots of test equipment that we are always using.
None to note at the moment
Sometimes it's too much politics.
* Stale leadership. The people leading the charge are trying to sell years old technology (to the industry) as cutting edge and our customers know it and the overall product is suffering. * Ideas from employees to make the company or product better are seen as annoyances rather than innovation. * If you work hard expect more work, but mediocrity gets you promoted as long as you have tenure. * Motorola bought this company out over a year ago and there is still a significant group of people who want to only be Envysion and actively resist the change.
Nothing material to share at this time.
Gets pretty boring almost immediately. And some managers tend to micro manage.
75% travel time is hard on family life.
With it being a global company with now primarily all remote workers, it can be hard to make and keep new connections. Wish more was offered to network with co-workers within the company in person more often.
Training is poor. Learning resources are poor.
Everyone is remote at the moment.
Typical issues that you will find with any very large company -Change takes time and most processes are layered with approvals -the work culture tends to shift based on the org/group you are working with -The employee population 20,000+ so you are going to run into some less than great co-workers
Too much red tape in regards to raises & promotions. People need to grow and support themselves, staying in the same role at the same pay for too long simply isn't feasible. I would have stayed had these concerns been taken more seriously sooner. I was also open to new positions within the company, and while this is something they advocate for, that process also moved very slow.
Pay is relatively on the lower side. Year to year raises and bonuses are small.

Management of teams changes hands very frequently. There has been very high turnover across the company in the last few years and most jobs that would be better handled by an in-house group have been farmed out to contracting companies for the cheapest amount possible. The finance department has been refusing to approve budgets that were due months ago, and it seems many teams are given much less budget to work with than they need to be functional. Even when those teams may bring in millions of profit yearly.

The only con I have is this company pays you really low than the market average or the market median (like way way low). Any other company of the same level as Motorola Solutions pays you almost double than what you get here. Bonuses and other cash benefits are not so good and in my opinion I feel like there is no growth for a long term in terms of salary. Maybe after working 1-2 years you might get some growth or raise but it will still be less or half to what companies outside will be paying you.
All in all, this is a great place to work, one note, compensation is competitive with all the benefits factored in, though it is important for you to advocate for yourself.
I don't have anything bad to say.
Low pay, out of touch management.
Pay was too low given my skill and experience level
Corporate management somewhat disconnected from projects.
Terrible management, training can be better, lack of job security.
Cylo work, no team interaction
None none none none nkne
Finance runs the show, management is ineffectual, and there’s no point in staying long term as yearly increases don’t even match inflation.
Terrible upper management from Chicago. Clueless about customer service and support.
Very historically-rooted and not super open to innovation
Promotions and raises are few and far between.

Sales driven - technical quality issues on new product offerings from a rush to market Contract redlines - lots of ""needed for contract signing"" line items that overrun the costs and eat at profit margin lower competitive pay for individual contributors
There were no issues to note
Terrible upper management from Chicago. Clueless about customer service and support.
Lack of direction/clarity from recent M&As, mid-level micromanagement and will ""backdoor"" certain reps. Same managers speak horribly about certain channel partners, not truthful, and can't be trusted. Again, varies based on location but I would caution to focus on management character and personality. Have also experienced a good amount of turnover in my time here.
No cons other than low compensation
Challenging environment in the late 90s
Compensation was low and never received RSUs.
Quarterly commission checks. 3rd quarter you have to work on weekends. Some outside reps do not work well with inside sales team.
Struggles with product direction at times
None really, unless you are silly
- Pay raises were small. - Frequent meetings.
I feel obligated to warn other HR professionals just how unethical the department here is, who may be considering taking a job. Upper HR management truly doesn’t care at all about the HR professionals that work for this company, and have had the worst turnover out of all the departments. Anyone who was tired of managements decisions was basically told they can leave, but those who stayed were rewarded with taking on the work of everyone who left with no type of increase in compensation or additional bonus. One of the leaders of the HR department basically violates the nepotism policy with multiple people who are related to them reporting directly into them. And since it’s the HR team, there is absolutely no oversight or anyone being held accountable for these unethical decisions. If you are a favorite (can only be achieved through nepotism) you will be treated royalty, even with the most bare minimum work. If you actually have been hired based on merit, you are only there to prop up the favorites so they can receive promotions and pay increases while you beg for scraps.
Not much comes to mind
Non applicable good company to be employed by.
No cons come to mind.
Training was entirely self lead, learned my way around the systems with minimal input from a more experienced tech. Loved the job at first, and then I agreed to cross train systems in exchange for a raise. Raise never happened. It was always next performance review I'd get that raise. Strung along for a year and a half with promise of promotion or raise and nothing ever came of it.
no place like this place
Slow to change old antiquated processes
too big and too slow in business actions closed so fast
culture, fixation, micromanagement, break time
Low pay shrinking employment, hard to connect with other team
Being a global company, one may have to work outside their regular business hours to interact with colleagues, customers and business partners located in different countries/time zones.
pay is below market average for the position
Not keeping up with inflationary salary increases. EXCESSIVE quota increase as of late to entire organization. You're killing one of the main benefits of working for this company.
good company but it depends on
MSI is in the process of transitioning to a software company in addition to its strong hardware core. While it's exciting to be part of this change, there are some challenges to overcome, such as old-school mentalities and, at times, too much red tape.

1. The people at Baxter play a big part in making this company great - it's not uncommon to hear of TBM's that have been with Baxter for 10+ years. Management is also wonderful. It is a great place to have a career. 2. The work life balance is unparalleled 3. Top of the line products 4. Generous overachievement payout 5. Great incentives to do well with upper management support

You will find a great development opportunity with a free environment to express your ideas and have the right support to develop them. You will have the ability to quickly reflect on how your contribution connects directly to our mission to save and sustain lives.
The climate of the company cultivates continued education, inclusivity, and partnership. Senior level management is very supportive of career goals and helps to facilitate them.
Good Benefits and decent team building
Seemed relatively stable from constant layoffs but not sure how it will be with Baxter at the helm.
Great mission, great products. Strong internal manufacturing with many products. R&D was being outsourced but there is a push now to keep R&D internal, which is working better.
Baxter is going through a transformation journey. If you like to be part of a continuous change journey, Baxter is the right place for you.
Great training, good payscale, excellent benefit package.

I have worked here a long time, and have had overall positive experience. Lots of opportunities, I have great work life balance.
Employees working from their Batesville Indiana location are outstanding, committed people. There was always a sense that you were involved in something significant, meaningful and worthwhile. Great leaders who cared.
Outstanding products that really do make a difference in patient's lives! Great coworkers truly passionate about the above.
good people good work-life balance decent pay
Good money, annual raises, good medical, dental insurance with eye coverage optional. Hardly ever have a lay off. Finished goods area is clean and sterile. You are making life saving equipment.
I absolutely love this job! And we're making a product that saves lives. It's very fulfilling to have a job that you enjoy that also has so much meaning and importance. Some of the good stuff...... **Pay **$1.50 shift differential for nights **Overtime ALWAYS available **$100 toward steel toe shoes (shoe truck on site each Monday) **Free uniforms **Free safety glasses (or) **If prescription safety glasses are needed Baxter pays $100 toward them. **160 hours PTO (40 hours released each quarter) **Health, dental, vision, life insurance, immediately **Outstanding maternity and paternity leave immediately **Too many voluntary benefits and employee discounts to list **Unlimited opportunities for advancement for the employee that wants it **Cafeteria on site **24-hour medical department I've read a lot of reviews on here where people are listing all kind of negative things about this company. There's always room for improvement in any company but I think many of these reviews are unfair. You'll get out of Baxter what you put into Baxter. Most of the people I see at work complaining that they don't get paid enough or that the culture is terrible are the same people that call off once a week, have a horrible work ethic and most always are negative about every single thing in life anyway. I've mentioned that there's unlimited room for advancement at Baxter. So if you think something's wrong then work towards the goal of obtaining a leadership position or moving up to assistant manager and then supervisor. Anything is possible at baxter. It's 100 percent possible to create the change that you're complaining about. In the end that benefits everybody. Working there for 6 months to a year and then leaving a negative review on the internet helps nobody. Baxter is a great place to work. But if we all work together and have a positive mindset it can be even greater.
The people that you work with.
Mission-Save and sustain lives aligns with my personal cover values

","None that I can think of
not the best communication between departments, poor quality in upkeep of building conditions
Particular Project Management and Quality Assurance team members associated with the project I am most prevalent on have really made it an unenjoyable and stressful project. The lack of leadership and direction has been repeated with these same individuals for 3 project releases now and it feels like Groundhog Day. Other teams do not seem to have this problem, so it should not be taken as an entire organization issue.
Corporate as corporate gets. Policies that leave employees with one weekend a month to themselves, Take away their overtime pay if there was a paid holiday that week, make a holiday schedule guarantee then force employees to come in during scheduled holidays, playing of favorites over years of service and contribution by some hiring managers when promoting internally, very last minute overtime notifications, tons of turnover every year. Metrics over people every day. stock buybacks when tax cuts roll around, layoffs when the market cools.
-Incredibly political place to work. you are beholden to the whims of managers (sometimes from other teams) and a senior leadership that doesn't entirely understand what's happening at the ground floor. -Cross-functional teamwork challenging because priorities and expectations are not aligned across the org. -Accountability is not a virtue here. When things fall apart, there is no interest in a post-mortem or course correction and instead a blame game is played. If you have nobody to scapegoat, then you are the scapegoat. -Outlook for the company is poor. Baxter recently had some big acquisition and over-extended. They are now spinning off part of their business and downsizing. Baxter will likely not disappear, but they're not exactly going to thrive without some real changes internally. -Return to office plan is pathetic. I heard rumors that senior leadership was basically taking attendance in the form of checking keycard swipes to see who was showing up.
Horrible field service and Hr leadership. All they care about is their image with the ELT. They will step all over someone to make themselves look good.
Leadership is clueless. The CEO and his entourage travel the world in private jets while the rest of the company is on travel bans, hiring freezes, laying off employees, and receiving such bad pay increases and bonuses it should be an embarrassment to the company. Baxter let go of entire teams with no backup to do the work and no idea what work was being done. It didn't even matter if you were exceeding expectations and turning in projects with huge savings. All they look at are numbers and you are nothing more than that. The environment leadership creates harbors distrust between employees. Instead of investing in their employees and working to improvement the company, they cut people. People aren't the reason you didn't do well, Baxter. The lack of good leadership coupled with disjointed systems, processes, and the economy were. Trust in your employees to do good work, to know what's going on in the day to day world, and hold on to them until the rough patch is over. Instead they let good people go and replaced them with more leaderships. Three directors and a consulting team were hired to ""do"" the work our team had already presented.
Company values quantity over quality. Stressful job. Hard work for sure.
Salary is awful, you have to get a 2nd job or do overtime to get by. Work life balance is not great, health benefits are ridiculous with high deductible plans. Future is not bright.
People are interchangeable and stocks dropping fast!
Supervisors are becoming non-existent, there are too many new hires to have such small supervision. There are so many GMP that need to be enforced and not forgotten!!
From a 10 + year employee it's sad to see what this company has fallen to. Morale is . . . nonexistent. There's an us versus them employee to management mentality now. It never used to be that way. ""It's not my job"" is the mantra these days, IF and it's a big if there is proper staffing. Don't do anyone a favor to help out because you'll own it from there forward. There is aging equipment and infrastructure that is being run to failure with zero investment in equipment and maintenance. 40 - 50 year old equipment.that is held together with bubble gum and band aids and replacement parts unavailable due to obsolescence. There are dinosaurs hanging on in management with archaic ideas and it is painfully evident. Leadership starts at the top and this company is drifting aimlessly just like its leadership. All this is evident by looking at the stock price over the last 18 to 24 months. If I had to put a time on it it would have started the death spiral around 2016. I used to enjoy coming to work, there were smart people, employee events and engagement. These things are long gone. Now it's just a ""job"". It's sad, it was never like this.
Where to start. The leadership is HORRENDOUS. People work their butts off to get some recognition, but we are rewarded with a fraction of our bonuses, low if any raises and mass layoffs. The entire work place is like a factory, where leadership just tells you what they want, and you do it. The credit goes to the highest up manager on the project and the company says so long to the contractors that put in the actual work.
none that i can think of
Hard hours but is within reason
Senior leaders who are disconnected from their broader teams, political environment, lack of accountability, no opportunity to move up, terrible business outlook means people are scared and unmotivated. Some people are overworked while others have nothing to do. Leaders seriously don't care about anything other than their own reputations. I had so much motivation and excitement when I started. Not anymore.
Not enough team gatherings. Bonuses are not base on performance but complaints
The cost of living increase wasn’t even half of what inflation is running year to date.
Working remotely can be a bit isolating Working at a company this large can be overwhelming
No negatives that I can see.
They don’t seem to offer any kind of yearly rise.
Low salary is the only downside

Company seems to be going in a direction of outsourcing as much of it's technical IT work as possible to save money and we all know how that goes
-Can be overly ambitious at times -Varying levels of organization on projects
Hours were horrible. Hard to take time off. Dire lack of training on systems you were ask to manage or manage with. However, you were required to train on everything else whether it had anything to do with your job. Financial management tended to look the other way rather than address major problems. Language barriers were a major obstacle. People who could barely speak English and didn't really comprehend were the support you were forced to rely on. Systems were poorly integrated and support was atrocious. The execution process for bringing new companies on board was a complete farce. Too much critical knowlege was not replicated and left the company highly exposed.
Somewhat disorganized, very large, a
They do not invest in the retention of current employees. People are leaving for better pay and less hassle.
Runs way too lean. Everyone is super stretched thin and stressed. The expectation is to work nights and weekends. Leadership knows and nobody cares. Work Life balance is non existent. ""Restructuring"" basically means firing a bunch of people and making others who are overwhelmed do there job. There is zero investment in R and D or the future. This makes many feel that Joe is selling the company off.
Med space, like other regulated industries is tough stuff.
Long hours Upper management only cares about numbers Employees are toxic and belong on Jerry Springer Much of the management staff grew up together and only look out for their own Outsiders are not welcomed Will work 6 to 7 days depending on orders Equipment always breaks
Long hours and understaffed. Lack of support
Incompetent Management within Regulatory Affairs group.
Working here for 15 years, I can honestly say there has never been lower work place morale. Every move management makes is to cover their liability. They pitch it as one thing but it’s clearly a lie. Communication is non existent unless they want to nitpick something you’re doing. If you do get a raise, it will be extremely lacking in today’s economic climate. People are struggling, families living check to check. Management couldn’t care less.
No training, procedures, processes. Work load over 12+ hours per day plus weekends.
-Can be overly ambitious at times -Varying levels of organization on projects
Very toxic work culture and environment
Profits off of medical system but will fire you and leave you without health insurance during medical crisis. Will not attempt to reasonably accommodate disability. Will also try to deny paying what is owed to you after firing you. Also switched to cheaper less effective health care plan after acquiring a business. Does not care about employees lives/well being whatsoever.
Tight production space Hard to work with QA lab
Hours that I worked - 9pm-1am
Lots of travel, overworked and gorssly underpaid, little to no recognition for hard work and long hours, absolutely no work life balance.
Acquisition driven innovation leaves no history for internal innovation understanding.
Lack of resources to support business continuity.
Disconnect between service and sales
Some (very few) coworkers that don't pull their weight and drag everyone around them down. Too much work falls on a select few individuals. No clear route to getting promoted. Seems to be time based rather than merit based which is ridiculous. No clear avenues to change career streams either. No employee perks like free coffee (which is basically an industry standard at this point) Hil-Rom acquisition destroyed the employee stock purchase plan Lack of recognition and respect from upper management.
*Management didnt know how to manage or when to ""lead"" or either *Management didnt know how to weed out the strugglers and let them go, so they kept many bad apples which hurts the customer experience *Limited training to enhance skill sets * Preached inhouse movement but dont live up to it
Low pay compared to similar positions
No training, procedures, processes. Work load over 12+ hours per day plus weekends.
A bit multi tasking sometimes
located outside of the city
Be prepared to study and work hard
Salary is not competitive compared to similar companies and industries.
Very toxic work culture and environment
Profits off of medical system but will fire you and leave you without health insurance during medical crisis. Will not attempt to reasonably accommodate disability. Will also try to deny paying what is owed to you after firing you. Also switched to cheaper less effective health care plan after acquiring a business. Does not care about employees lives/well being whatsoever.
Not as flexible culture due to size of organization. Constant changes and redundancy of the processes. Big focus on bottom line and EBTIDA performance, with not much flexibility for the targets, if you are not achieving KPIs you might want to start looking for another job. Corporate world is detached from the manufacturing sites, like any other corporation.
1. The comp plan/pay structure can be confusing but is forever changing 2. Could be a good or bad thing but a very conservative company and has a very cautious approach to any change. Baxter could benefit from some change/Acquistions but does not take big risks.
""Do more with less"" is the mantra: Teams in all functions routinely understaffed and often unable to even back fill vacated roles let alone open new roles to get the team to the water line. ""Best Place to Work"" surveys sent by sr leadership make it seem like they care, but then any negative results are rarely acted upon and managers are pressured to have their teams reply more positive despite nothing changing. Perpetual drain of experienced team remembers, with robust subject matter expertise and history not valued. Can just outsource or bring in young talent (somehow without robust training programs) to keep the churn... ""Forcing"" people back to office despite it being proven unnecessary and many team members already being located around the globe. But fear to say anything because ""if your job doesn't need you in the office I can outsource it anywhere for cheaper"", while having the audacity to ""celebrate"" the flexibility they claim to have.
Work life balance is often not appropriate with excess overtime resulting in losing good employees and leaders. Failure to meet production demands in a short time frame can lead to rapid negative consequences even when issues may be uncontrollable such as delays in obtaining/maintaining appropriate staffing to meet production demands.
politics, complexity, government, emergencies, others
Strict guidelines when it comes to time off policy.
In the recent reorganization employees were moved to new positions significantly below their skill level and cut their pay. These are long term employees with a history of strong, highly-rated performance.
Do not listen to employees and lack of communication.
not cons, have always been treated equally and fair.
Stable, but not as innovative.
CEO with history of splitting up companies, too many Re-Orgs and layoffs meaning uncertain future, needs to scale down amount of meetings - always seem to have meetings about meetings. New hires being hired as fully remote while existing long term employees are required to go into the office. Outsourcing jobs or sending them overseas for cheaper pay.
It was a large campus. A lot of time was just spent moving from one location to another. Always short-staffed. Always playing catch up from the previous shifts workload. Always overworked.
Some politics and red tape
Pay was lower than industry average
No job security, layoffs constantly
Products were either on allocation or backorder.
Need to improve the use of digital technologies and standardization.
Pay is not the best but I believe it is comparable to the market
No reward for effort put in, no one listens to your complaints, restrictive salary
Employee voices did not seem to be heard when it came to project warning flags (over promising in an unrealistic time frame). They would just push employees to work faster even when it was expressed the effort would still not meet the promised deadline. There were no checks and balances on middle management. Career opportunities and advancement is just talk and dishonest.
Management turnover is high, and many leaders are not promoted from within. Emphasis seems to be on cost-cutting over the past few years. In-person presence has really dwindled at all locations in Northern Illinois.
Senior leaders continue to change and as a result, there is no growth opportunity at Baxter
Doesn't always follow company SOP and/or stand behind their employees.
High political environment The leaders do not care about the people The senior leaders put attention only on their money and their ego - they destroyed the stockholder value HR is a bad joke! Change for change - too much Diversity and Inclusion is a marketing tool only
Do not feel valued by senior leadership.
Very cold in some places and hot in others
The last few years compensation has not been favorable. Current environment is challenging, there is change fatigue and anxiety about what is coming next in the organization.
The culture started to change when senior managers moved to Chicago.

hr needs to improve mid-level management needs to step up communication across functions/departments and management needs to improve
Upper management has gone down hill over the years. Many people dislike it at Baxter. Over the last few years they have cut back on employees and doubled the workload on the rest. On the blend/palletizing area it is hot and dirty and pretty fast paced.
The 12-hour shifts can be hard to get used to if you've never done them. But with the 12-hour shifts you're guaranteed a 3-day weekend every other week. Sometimes people forget that this isn't a high school so there can be lots of gossip and drama at times. But if you're an adult that remembers that, in fact, you did graduate high school this shouldn't affect you.
The leadership is a huge problem. They have ideas in their heads that never work out. Also there is no developing going on, nor positions for people to advance. You are stuck at your level until multiple people leave.
Not transparent Poor decisions by executives
-Culture has become toxic -No work life balance. -Constant reductions of staff leads to absorbing work of other. Company claims work is becoming automated or shifted to lower cost regions, but work consistently is dropped or no automation is performed before exiting team members, -Laying off people who have had 10+ years of experience and great performance due to downsizing.
Some politics and red tape
Executive team at Hillrom overinflated quotas and pipeline to oversell the company to Baxter. That made quotas skyrocket and people left or couldn’t make it
Pay was lower than industry average
Getting permanent potion is hard and most of the job is contract positions.
Products were either on allocation or backorder.
Need to improve the use of digital technologies and standardization.

","Overall cost structure of the bank has been under pressure as it's above that of rivals. This is a drag on the share price and will likely force the company into cost reduction strategies.
Micromanagement Toxic management Bad work life balance expectation to put in face time and work and respond to emails long past business hours
At times was hard to see a path to promotion
Limited commercial flexibility and ambition / Products scattered across various departments that üractice only limited collaboration
12-month contract that can potentially* lead to a full-time offer
could be Difficult to get promoted
Poor management, a lot of French, mediocre compensation, stringent constraints
Management can be conservative in their approach and micromanage.
Finance is pretty demanding in general
nothing bad to say great people
Very archaic place to work. Culture is work work work and more work with no incentives. Bonuses and raises are non existent. Management doesn't seem to care about growth or opportunities for their employees. Lots of turn over and continuous training of new employees for those that stay.
There is no compensation growth. They do not value Tech that much. They have VIE people from France, who act as your back up. I think they come at lesser pay. So its very tough to find growth.
It was a mess when I was there. It seems too many managers want to so business but don’t want to commit the resources to do it. Comp was awful, morale was low.
Cons are everything unrelated to work life balance and benefits
Conservative bank with main focus away from US made it difficult to grow business
Nothing in particular. As you move up in roles salaries tend to lag compared to moving to another firm.
No cons, good people fair compensation
- Have clearer internal processes and guidance for the analyst program
Salary is way below par, I hadn't gotten a raise for 3 years in a row even after being one of the top performers on the team. And now when i have stopped going the extra mile and i am being told you may not get a raise because you are not performing as you used to. My Colleges are facing the same issue and most of us are in the process of switching the job. Good luck to future employees this company sucks big time. Bonuses are non existent. Back to office is 3 days when litterally offices are empty. To grow to the top you have to be French.
work enviroment and headquarters in NYC & Paris
Some of the people are pretentious
the work culture is not that good
Limited internal mobility in addition to an international bureaucracy
Poor management. Obsolete IT systems. Low retention
Really hard to get anything done. Many checks and controls.
average pay; not easy to advance in career
Pay is not that great compared to industry
Doesn’t pay much compared to competition
Nothing bad to say except the pay isn’t on par with other banks.
Hours during lead left deal
Pay is not that great compared to industry
Doesn’t pay much compared to competition
Pay feels behind the market, it takes them awhile to move salaries or other perks (meal expense allowance) when the rest of the industry moves. Even then, SG still feels behind the curve. Culture is highly team-dependent, so beware of getting stuck somewhere where the fit isn't right. Communication from seniors to juniors regarding administrative things (salary, bonus, mobility) is often unclear.
French Mgt is good but wierd
The flip side is things take a long time to get done. Everything needs to be approved by Paris. And if one is able to start something in NYC or Montreal and get some success, Paris will take over and try to run the show.
Micro managers and no work/life balance
Pay is mediocre, return to office >=2 per week while no one is in the office. Seems pointless
-bad management -lack of guidance/mentorship
PTO DAYS only 5 days
Confusing org structure but friendly people
Very bureaucracy focused, pay generally below market, poor managers who mostly only manage up, low tier IB and it shows.
The Amer region could be more independent of Paris
Managers bully and exhibit bias toward employees which is covered up as long as those managers check the right boxes. Company takes barometer surveys and ignores the results. Jobs are being moved to Montreal at a rapid rate. In general, company has no regard for staff and looks down on them. Company claims diversity is a priority yet uses that as a front and disproportionately hires French nationals. If you look up fail up and disengagement in the dictionary you will see the words Societe Generale
Pay is below market rate.
Pay, direction of company, turn over
Poor management and not flexible about work from home
1. Management do not care for its employees except 2. Bonus is essentially non-existent 3. No work-life balance. 4. No upward movement
Not competitive in the industry.
Salary adjustments and salary increases are difficult even with well performing reviews
Too hierarchical, poor standards, too willing to please the higher-ups at expense of quality, sub-standard writing by at least 80% of the analysts - good writing isn't valued.
No cons bur very analytic
solutions not fully implemented leads to needing new solutions
- lots of turnover at all levels
Compensation is average Long hours French culture
Poor management Bad work policies Bad work environment
Central Decision making. Difficult to challenge.
They are not the most generous payers.
Bonus low. Based salary correct
long working hours and bad managers
Work life balance, salary, visa
Steeped in layers of hierarchical management -- there are many more bosses than at any other investment bank. The result is pay is about 25-40% below industry average (plus frustration). Their garden leave is also double that of competitors.
Conform to the culture of mediocrity or perish
- lots of turnover at all levels
Compensation is average Long hours French culture
Feels like the outpost that it is vis-a-vis Paris. Tons of turnover. Mediocre bank performance and senior management translate to an overall mediocre employment experience.
Lot of turnover due to not many deals
People speak in French always don't think about others even they understand or not. Bad salaries , bad bonus , no promotions . Heavy workload and most of mangers are insensitive to your personal problem. Growth is very limited. No learning as most people are dumb or only dumb people want to stay back smart ones change job quickly. Only criteria to grow is "" office politics "" and how close you are with your manager :) .
Central Decision making. Difficult to challenge.
A lot of office politics
Pay is awful compared to other banks. Management is terrible and does not have anyone's back. Reorgs every 1-2 years In capital markets SG is losing market share every year
They are not the most generous payers.
Managers micro manage and they don’t have good people skills.
Bonus low. Based salary correct
A lot of work for the job
- Incredibly difficult to move up internally. Management uninterested in junior development - Diversity and inclusion constantly rammed down your throat - Strong French influence on everything - including socialist bonus pool (i.e. bonus payouts have less to do with your individual performance or your team's P&L than they do with overall performance of the bank) - Ridiculously bureaucratic. Way too many committees, processes, etc - Pay is below market - Company is weighed down by underperformers in France who are virtually impossible to fire due to French legislation
Complex organization with a lot of dependencies
Work From Home policies based on needs
the salary could be better
Don't expect support in growth
Mobility is unclear and largely limited to French speaking
not good to have a full time after an internship as they don't recruit a lot
KT is not always there where it is needful
A lot of office politics
There is no specific cons about this company

The company has a high turnover
Negative environment that doesn’t motivate you to want yo give 100%.
