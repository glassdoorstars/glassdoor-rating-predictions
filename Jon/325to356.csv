https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Marshalls-Reviews-E155412.htm,"Upbeat management staff...clean store and excellent associates!
Easy work, nice coworkers, fun environment
A diverse workforce, 10% off employee discount, occasionally an extra 10% off employee discount. Working returns isn’t too bad, you don’t have to work register and working the fitting rooms is the easiest job I’ve ever had.
They are flexible with scheduling 1 week Vacation and 1 week personal time during my first year
Is great for a first job for young people as it allows them to learn responsibility and grants them the opportunity to build on skills that may be useful in their further careers!(Especially customer service, sales, and cash handling.)
You get to see everything new as it's coming in Most of the customers and the associates and supervisors were nice
- wasn't too busy and nice coworkers
It is a fairly easy job
A few nice coworkers, but honestly that’s it
Nice hours and fair pay
Very organized and peaceful work environment.
It is a nice place to work at.
great place with awesome people!
A few nice coworkers, but honestly that’s it
Worked with good people, was never afraid of management
I’ve worked for 2 of the TJX stores and they are very good at working with your schedule. You can customize your hours and you are paid weekly, which is convenient.
Discounts on items in stores.
The Coordinators were very helpful
Met great people and friends there
they had Good benefits and decent pay,
Very flexible work schedule and easy to transfer if you move far away.
You get a discount, which at Marshall's is always a plus.
part time is good for students for extra money, company benefits is good if you are full time
Learn a lot of customer service, helped me a lot .
Most important thing…people coke first!
Don’t have to do much, made friends
It's a job like any other.
The work isn’t super hard
Very diverse environment with great communication and managing skills.Marshall’s also gave the great opportunity to experience working in all areas of the store and had great managing skills.
It’s a good job overall for an entry level position. The pay is ok and the environment can be slow or fast paced depending on the time and day. The overall work environment is very positive as well your coworkers will definitely be nice and management usually are very flexible with your schedule. If you hate dealing with Karen’s this job is not for you but if you’ve gotten used to that customer base it can be pretty fun to work here.
The Coordinators were very helpful
Good Hour to feed my family
Easy interview, weekly pay, that's pretty much it

Great leadership/ mentorship Friendly Associates in every department Organization on working days Flexible work schedules Professionally trained before starting work
Close to home and I wanted to get out of the restaurant business.
- you will learn how to be patient
Simple and straightforward, not too much responsibility but also not a role you should anticipate staying in for too long if you do good work. What's expected of you is clearly defined and it's good practice to prepare for higher levels of management. Two paid 15-minute breaks per 8 hour shift.
Flexible shifts especially when interchanging with co workers Monthly recognition prizes and raffles Enjoyable work environment
You could pick your own schedule
you can always return back to them
Liked working with other teens

The people that work at this store are kind and welcoming. The management was flexible with my college schedule and always let me pick up hours when I was home on break from school.

The coworkers that I have are phenomenal and I enjoy working with them as a team.

good management in place today
Easy work, easy scheduling, coworkers were not horrible, can work multiple positions
talk to people and clean
It’s very easy to get promotions, and it’s really worth the experience if you’re a student
Coworkers were nice but that's about it
","Time management...we get new merch in every day and it's difficult to get everything out when our store is sooo busy! Not really sure if this is a con.
No stable schedule, rude customers sometimes
I remember when the onboarding coordinator, Estella, told us that “we’re like family here!” And she’s not entirely wrong, because the relationship among employees and management is dysfunctional and toxic like most families. A manager and a coordinator had the nerve to talk smack on, right in front of me while putting racks of clothes away. I should’ve walked out from there. Hourly pay is astonishingly low and you aren’t guaranteed much or any hours. Management will claim that there’s no payroll, but they’ll hire a bunch of new associates! The company is extremely antiunion and they don’t care about their workers. There really is no incentive or benefits of working for Marshall’s. Management and employees are miserable and only work there for the little crumbs in their paycheck. There is no community in that store and the coordinators have no right to have such massive egos.
Yearly raises are less than a dollar. I've been there nearly 2 years, starting as full time then going to part-time, and my total raise amount has been 0.93 cents. You're made to work all over the store in various departments with no incentives or bonuses for the extra work. I was hired to work in one department, but after a few months I became a cashier, a stockroom associate, fitting room attendant, etc. You receive very little acknowledgment for going above and beyond. A pat on the back if that. When you're on the register, you're expected to help meet a quota for selling the store's credit card. You don't receive any compensation for it. The ""incentive"" is a chance to win a $20 Marshalls gift card. Ridiculous. The minimum pay here is not a livable wage at all. Making $12-$13/hr can not afford their employees to live in this area where apartments are starting off at $1200/mo.
There will certainly be some stressful days where you will learn how to work under pressure but as long you have a can do attitude and view it as an opportunity to learn and enhance performance under pressure, you can do it!
They start you at minimum wage, even if you have 15 years experience. Large turnover At least 2-3 call outs most days Way too much expected of associates without the pay You have to push the store credit card on everyone
- holiday season was a nightmare, short breaktimes, privileged customers
In my opinion It does not pay well
Low pay for what I’m being asked to do, terrible management, entitlement to workers
No cons from me, that place was great
No promotion guaranteed, hours fluctuate detrimentally regardless if open availability
I can't think of any cons.
Sometimes get busy in the store but it is okay!
Low pay for what I’m being asked to do, terrible management, entitlement to workers
Sometimes fast-paced and hectic when busy
There is high turn over. At times, because a lot of people use it as an extra income, they don’t come in, which places strain on those who do. Holidays and back to school are relentless.
Overworked and underpaid. Don't recommend it.
The boss was a nightmare
Management Low pay Little to no time off
Culture, hours, working with public
Short staffed a lot, management can make or break.
Reminded cashiers every chance that more credit card sign-ups meant more shifts, which was kind of manipulative. Also, a few members of lower management tended to power trip sometimes to the younger sale associates.
people is not nice, low education
Graduated from high school so decided to get a better pay job
Can be hectic with how quickly things can change on a daily basis.
Not the best pay , rude customers
Unstable with few hours and low pay.
Customer and register can become tedious
Appreciate how hard employees work and pay more. It would also be appreciated if they were more understanding on the employees circumstances when it comes to emergencies etc.
The worst and only con is that the managers pretty much harass you all day to get customers to sign up for the tjx credit card. One of the worst “rewards” credit cards out there. With pretty subpar rewards and high interest rate. During my time there management had a sheet with highlighted names of ppl who were low on credit card sign ups and would threaten and harass employees with names highlighted. It was even encouraged to lie to the customers to get them to sign up. And you were required to ask every single customer even regulars who previously have rejected the advances and who seemed annoyed by the experience. Worst of all there was no reward or commission for customer sign ups. If you want a simple cashier job get it somewhere else. They will pay you the same for the same type of work minus the requirement to sale their terrible credit card or just get a sales job instead of you like selling at least you’ll be properly compensated for selling something.
The boss was a nightmare
Lots of Responsibility in other departments.
Not a retail associate, stuck unloading the trucks,
Management Low pay Little to no time off
Sometimes there are not many hours on my schedule.
Work harder, stay later, sell more credit cards, for minimum wage.
Not much room to grow
Hard to know where to start. The only thing the company cares about is opening up TJX cards so sales are nice but opening TJX That's what they push with a hard sell. Be nice to customers but get them to open a card is all they really care about. They try to intimidate employees. Air conditioning broke customers complained they brought in the loudest airplane type fans which almost made me go deaf. You can't complain about anything because they reduce your hours. They jerk you around from one department doing the next. They hire you for 1 position and 1 function but while you're at it do all these other jobs in other departments although there's never any proper training even for the original Position. What is pathetic is that they only push opening up cards because they say open more cards more rewards more snacks like we are dogs. Most employees are very unhappy but we're all in a position where we need to work somewhere. So we put up with their Poor treatment.
Short staffed a lot, management can make or break.
Hard to move up if they don’t like you being in the front
-management isnt great - horrible communication -guilt tripping
Questionable management, Customers are awful
understaffed and constantly working 5 different people's slack from barely working coworkers
TJX CARD!!!!! Its a sales position if your a cashier .... terrible
Graduated from high school so decided to get a better pay job
Very limited amount of hours.
- Pay is pretty terrible. Hourly wage.
The company itself is only concerned about getting credit cards and its coming from the very top to the very bottom. If your store isn't making goals for credit cards your simply not performing. Doesn't matter what other metrics the store is meeting, the store is failing overall if credit card goals are not being met. The associates are paid poorly and so is the management for that matter for the work expected, exspecially considering most stores are still running short staffed and the people that are applying want only day shift hours. The company as a whole needs to re-evaluate the business hours, if we are unable to staff the hours we should not be open those hours. Shop lifting has become rampant and there is nothing we can do, literally are hands are tied or we lose our jobs... don't call the police, lose your job, don't confront, lose your job, don't get a license plate # or vehicle type, that's right lose your job.... but you can send a report up to LP with a description of the ""suspect"" nothing ever happens. The associates are overly needy, whiny and act like middle school children and these are middle age adults, who frequently need redirection and multiple reprimands on any given day. They offer lots of programs and different employee focused things, but when you work in a retail store, there is little to no opportunity to take advantage of these different programs.
Holiday season come around you cannot call out or reschedule
Opening credit cards was stressful Managers were disrespectful Low pay. they reduce your hours if you don't open credit cards
Can be hectic with how quickly things can change on a daily basis.
not the best work to pay ratio
Not good pay or benefits
Management is chaotic, schedule was not my preferences, hard to talk to managers
Difficult managers to deal with
- MAJOR emphasis on selling the TJX Credit Card - No commission/compensation for selling a good amount of credit cards - Performance score centered around making sure a credit card is applied for - Can be very short staffed and fast-paced - Lower-end wages for a lot of physically demanding work - Extra benefits available to all workers not advertised unless full-time
terrible job company doesn't care about you
Customer and register can become tedious
It can be long days on your feet the whole time
Appreciate how hard employees work and pay more. It would also be appreciated if they were more understanding on the employees circumstances when it comes to emergencies etc.
Long lines some days there were short opened registers
Since changing the store hours to 9am to 10pm, it’s exhausting. Work life balance could be there, but the job itself can be very draining, especially with all of the call outs and turnover. Management wants, no expects that you will put their awful credit card push above all else, including the interest of the customer.
Pressured and threatened other coworkers and I to get customers to sign up for the company credit card. Didn’t understand that I was a full time student and that the job was part time, so they’d sometimes schedule me 6 days a week even during school hours (when I was in high school).
Hope you can push a credit card app
excessive back stock, no room to put out new merch., not really allowed to focus on one area to make it presentable, they call you for back up to to the front when it's not needed. Constantly pushing to get credit applications, undestaff, too many call=outs
I think the company was doing a good job managing associates and workspace.
Not enough money or hours.
- you will be blamed for mistakes that full time staff makes - management very unorganized
The role is still basically cashier with a couple added tasks, so you're on your feet for the whole shift. Daily 45-minute lunch is unpaid so full (5d x 8hr) work week comes out to ~36 paid hours rather than 40 — this is typical and not really a con just something to factor into your calculations/consideration.
Standing for over 8 hours a day when covering others shifts Long lines and pressure to meet sales goals
Holiday season come around you cannot call out or reschedule
wish they paid more hourly
Opening credit cards was stressful Managers were disrespectful Low pay. they reduce your hours if you don't open credit cards
Some shifts can be long
Low pay, with out experience
Unrewarding and not intensive work.
not the best work to pay ratio
Truly depends on if your manager is nice and also it constantly changes like the 3 managers when I started have all went to different stores when I left and I only worked for a year and a half.
Not good pay or benefits
Management is chaotic, schedule was not my preferences, hard to talk to managers

Fast Ling Early Quick Nice

Credit card goals and payroll
Retail is retail, so this store definitely has its challenges. Tough customers sometimes, but nothing I couldn`t handle.
terrible job company doesn't care about you
Raise our wages so that I can live and continue my education comfortably.
Associates that tend to lack off and not help and also doesn't provide much assistant
The only negative is promoting and encouraging people to get the credit card.
It can be long days on your feet the whole time
not respectful, associates do much more then they get pay for, not organized
Bad hours as a teenage worker
Hours are not that great
Nothing is bad or too good
holidays, trucks, bad customers, hours
hours worked could be paid more
Have to request off 3 weeks in advance even though the schedule is not made 3 weeks in advance, customer service
lack of help and people
Customers are overly disrespectful, it’s terrible. Sometimes feels like highschool
I worked there for two years and while the management was ok , I was easily working 8 hour shifts 7 days in a row.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Disney-Parks-Reviews-E13843.htm,"Good benefit and good career coaching
My favorite reason for working here are the benefits. I enjoy the vacation pay, health insurance, and retirement options. They just added 401k along with current pension plan. I also had my college expenses paid for and graduated with a Bachelors degree with the intent to also get my MBA. I love that it’s not costing me anything.
This is hands down the best fast paced photography experience you can get! I don't think there is any other photographer job position in the world were you'll take more pictures every single day. You will learn a lot skills that will help you gather experience in different types of photography like family, headshots, couples, product, sports, etc.. You will also gain lots of experience in guest relations, and will have the opportunity to work in different areas around the resort.
At first it was terrific, a good work environment, a big happy family and inside all day, great, plus 40 hours every week. The after work, loved working in the Parks & Resorts.
You meet some amazing people from the guests to the cast members you work with. Some of the unique and exclusive experiences, events, and perks you can receive as a cast member can definitely be incredible, but the perks always seem like something the hire ups dangle as a ""see, it's not so bad huh? device. But at what cost??
They really promote the Disney benefits and perks of going to parks and discounts if you plan to do that a lot. Large company with a lot of diverse departments and roles if you want to move around within the same company.
Free park entrance, free uniforms, healthcare, discounts
Access to the Disney Parks For Free
They do not care about their employees and will try to make your life hell! Do not work there!
The benefits are good. The pay is good. It is unionized. You meet people from all over the World, and learn directly from them about their culture, and their language.

such a fun job! Best experience
Enjoyable experience, working week after week receiving fair pay, and doing what I love at the same time.
No pros other than park tickets
The pay is pretty good, now that the union got through and there was a raise. The free park admission was awesome. Discounts, especially during the holidays, are great. There is an attendance points system that is hard to understand at first, but once you get used to is actually somewhat helpful.
Depending on your role, there is a lot of face to face interaction with Guests. Leadership is very supportive.
Benefits and room for growth.

","Little bit timing shift inflexible
Working in a store is not terrible but can be boring. But any job that is not in my career field would feel boring. My advice is to enjoy the small interaction and soak in all the opportunities. I think it’s a fair trade of benefits for having a boring job.
It is physically demanding, and many times it requires working under harsh weather conditions like extreme heat or rain.
Management changes, went downhill, morale went down, no cast cooperation, all for themselves, lazy cm up in the breakroom for 3 hours, we reported, I got the boot, shamefully.. Asst. Mgr. didn't care, favoritism, dreaded working there some days.
No living wage which everyone already knows. Forced to work 10+ hour shifts even when you did not ask for overtime consistently, not just a single event. No real accommodations made for disable people who need it. I was essentially told that if I ""asked too many accommodations, your job will be on the line."" I knew in that moment they really could give two you know what's about it. I knew it was time to go. Oh also, there's no REAL room for growth in the company unless you're one of the lucky ones. There is very clear favortism everywhere within the parks operations departments that unless you're besties with a leader who has pull, you'll be stuck in that one place forever. Unless you transfer, but it'll happen again.
Very cold and toxic leadership. Shallow and empty promises of a great place to work but no substance to any care, empathy, trust or priority of employees from the very top levels. middle managers are micro managed and not empowered to lead with care. Bad leaders get promoted. Good people get abused and taken advantage of.
You’re supposed to only be schedule 2 DAYS with 3rd day as a need basis. What they really mean is you’ll be scheduled ALL 3 DAYS. And for part timers that means ALL 3 DAYS 8+ HOURS EVERY WEEK!!Full time get mandated a lot for their 6th day when they’re new too but the major difference is that full timers are scheduled for only 6 hours for some reason. It’s completely ridiculous and actually makes no sense as to why they do this!!!! Scheduling, hours, lack of communication, lack of transit, lack of end goal, ATTENDANCE POINTS NO SICK DAYS - don’t get sick at Disney they don’t care, NO TRAINING they just throw you on the job pretty much.
No room for promotion unless you are magically favored by management. Workers Comp is never there for you and will never answer your phone calls. No flexibility in schedule when you gain seniority in the company you can only change your schedule once or twice a year so if you want to go to school and they change your schedule you are now screwed
The management is horrible and does not work well.
Very biased work environment, amongst cast members /drivers. Too many trying to come up. A lot of micro management. The health Ins deductions are so expensive, and so are the union dues.

-Calls can be escalated situations where guests are unhappy and we must solve for yes -metrics are strict, but not unattainable -Must work for one year full time before qualifying for insurance -Most of the team works from home, so you never really have the chance to get to know your colleagues
You are treating as disposable at any time.
I really don’t have any
Starting wages are just okay. To make more money, you have to find a way to move up, which can take some time.
for me it was the commute
Standing outside working during the summer was a struggle.
No one cares about your growth and development
Hours during peak times (which are pretty much always) are a lot, and you can be forced into overtime (6-day work weeks) and 12/14-hour shifts. Most things in my location were broken and kind of falling apart, and leadership was just generally fine except for one or two outliers, who were excellent.
It is a very hospitality focused role, which results in a lot of face-to-face interaction with Guests.
Inconsistent scheduling, lots of change and high turn over.
The attention to detail and quality of the park's attractions and facilities are exceptional, making it a popular destination for families, couples, and friends. However, due to its popularity, Disney can get crowded, especially during peak seasons, and lines for popular attractions can be long.

You will be working holidays. It will be hard to get time off, depending on your location. Your schedule may make it difficult to have a ""normal"" life outside of work.
You will never grown if your are not American citizen and your ethnicity is important too. Just crazy that I been there five year and profesional profile and all the new Students get posición in months. Fluently English and is they are American better. Feel bad about the magic
Long hours. No breaks. Far parking
- Layoffs have affected workloads - Poor management
Long hours or no hours
High-stress and high maintenance environment and you must fit the mold or you will be looked at constantly by the superiors. If it's not the company that stresses you out, it will be the crowds, if you do not do well with crowds and making sure every single guest is being accounted for then it may not be the right fit for you.
Pay range was low for job
Not all holidays are off
The drama + leadership was absolutely awful. It was petty 'high school drama' everyday and the leadership only cares about the company. Had a few emergencies (one being that my house was potentially in danger because of a storm) and they did not care whatsoever. All they cared about were the numbers.
Management does not alway support you, you may not see your manager every day or even weekly. Pay increases come annually by a predetermined union contract. Cost of living is not factored in and union is very blasé
Hard to move up and move around. Wanted to grow more.
Not a lot of English speaking people worked there
It’s all about getting seniority and playing the waiting game!
Cliquey environment sometimes. Scheduling is far removed.
short hours late shifts strict dress code
Hot, long hours little pay
Progression is difficult, lack of support, no accountability, little oversight
The role is exclusively part time or seasonal, so a second job is almost certainly necessary.
so loud kids try to run out the park

Rough days with poor management support

The company did not handle the pandemic well with the way they treated their employees. I also was wayyyy overworked and underpaid. I only made $10 an hour in 2019.
can be very competitive, and not a long term career for some
As a part time worker, they don't schedule you almost ever, so in order to work you need to be on the facebook group asking coworkers for shifts.

Most managers felt incompetent and the best managers moved in to bigger and better things (Happens everywhere at Disney World) It's hot. Upper management at WDW Magic Kingdom has said that custodians are not part of ""the show"" so that we must remain as inconspicuous as possible and not put any attention upon ourselves whatsoever.
Hard work and heavy lifting

Low pay for being overworked.
Super hot inside the custome
You are a number in the system Depending on location, you rarely saw management
Long hours at times, but I worked with alot of good people
Standing for long periods of time Monotonous Guests can be draining
- Physically taxing, many hours in the sun and working with heavy equipment - Difficult to grow - You will get stuck doing the least favorite job sometimes, but you rotate so it's fair
Lack of hours, scheduling conflicts, ability to move up
Management has favorites. Sick time is a bit restrictive. Underpays
Long hours, low pay, experience depends on management
Longs hours on your feet

Company policy Workload Management Working environment
The owners of Wegmans are truly family oriented. It has always been a pleasure to meet the owners and see how down on earth they are. We get a lot of grocery coupons and many employee appreciation cook outs. Most of the people you work with at your level are great to work with.
Used to be much better in the work life balance area.
Good healthcare benefit, 401k with employer match, good pay.
Great place to work for part time employees
Flexible hours and guaranteed raises!
Good Pay, Good Culture, slay.
Lots of room for growth Forces you to work hard Great people and management Very people oriented
Once you join the team it's like joining the family. But once I stopped working there the people who were super friendly stopped talking to me totally. Nothing against the company or any of the people who work there. I'm a people person and was just disappointed that when I left and would return to shop as a customer, I wasn't even spoken to by some of the managers who were friendly when I was an employee. Still, its a cool company to work for.
Coworkers were nice, some opportunity for advancement
Great place to work for part time employees

I really enjoyed working there. You were a part of a big family
It pays okay, staff is generally very nice and welcoming. The job is simple and pays decently.
experience, portfolio building, pays relatively well
Seems to be many ways to move up as long as you are willing to relocate. Works with employees in times of need. Friendly environment with upper management you can always talk with them or human resources about concerns. Pay seems to be competitive considering the work it is. Company tries to be fair to all types of people. Plenty of work events.
Very fun to work in. Low stress and very flexible with scheduling if you are a college student.
The benefits are great, fairly inexpensive. The 401k is worth investing in. We have a cafeteria in the office building. Flexible remote/in-person workdays.
Everyone is friendly, its challenging work and they train well.
- diversity - benefits - family like place to work
I am very impressed with the Wegmans family's high standards and the entire management team. The upper management sincerely appreciates everyone's hard work. I wouldn't know about the other locations, but in the Cheese department in Wilmington, DE, and Downingtown, PA, the cheese shop manager Amanda and Mandy acknowledge all team member's contributions and show their appreciation. Both managers are excellent role models of good work ethics and leadership. I greatly respect all team leaders and managers at both locations. This is one of the companies that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a company that helps you to advance.
Great Co-workers, Great employee appreciation, Close to school and home,
Work life balance, flexibility, great insurance
Decent place for work...company perks...decent retirement and insurance
- Love the people! I genuinely look forward to seeing them when I head into work each day - Some cool benefits that I didn't expect like employee coupons, work boots, etc. -Management has been understanding abt time off (tho, of course I say this as a part time employee)
Wegmans has great benefits even as a PT employee. Management is professional and personable.
Plenty of room to grow and advance your career Extremely flexible with work/life balance Very positive work environment, Friendly and helpful coworkers Very professional and competent management Paid every week Raises every year based on evaluation
The people you work with are definitely the best reason to work at Wegmans.

Only pro is like twice a year they have abbotts ice cream for employees. Other than that, nothing.
- Great team to work with - Decent pay for part-time with raises every 6 months - Relatively easy job - Kitchen staff is also very helpful - Free snacks and drinks in the break room - Employee-only coupons (every week this summer, we get $10 off any purchase coupons) - They are very good about scheduling (I had originally applied for stocker, but this catering position was a better fit for my availability. I'm only scheduled within my availability (late weekdays and anytime on weekends) and usually get around 25 hrs / week as requested.) - Management is supportive and available if you need any help - Uniforms are provided (shirts, hats) and you can get a free pair of non-slip shoes every 6 mo.

This is a review of PART-TIME: Flexible work hours, tools to do my job provided, trainings to do my job provided. At my store, great senior management team, always ready to pitch in when ever and where ever needed, immediate supervision (coordinators and team leaders) were mostly good. There is progression available for those that want it, it is competitive. Overall the work environment is good, sometimes the work is difficult (it is very physical). I'm considered a ""senior citizen"" (over age 60) and I am not alone in my store. Every department and section has a few of us. I have not encountered any problems with my co-workers or management.

Store interior was nicely decorated. As with similar jobs, some coworkers and customers were decent people worth meeting.

Big company means great processes
","Downsides, it’s a really fast-paced environment, at times, there were no downtime
I don't have many cons. I left because of reasons that had nothing to do with my job.
Some of the management are not that great. Some of the team leads should not be in that position. As they are unable to handle difficult conversations or choose not to do anything about a complaint you may have. There is no real reward in our department for doing a great job or going above and beyond. So departments though so reward their people with care card gift certificates but that is based on what your direct management wants to do for the bakery we never get any. You are only talked to when they want to complain about something you did.
In the last few years the company has become more profit driven and as a result just isn’t concerned with the lives of their worker anymore. They do nice things like bbqs and food in the break room but if you are seriously Ill and out of work for weeks, no one will care. You won’t get even on call or text. If you have a condition that keep you in pain everyday and come to work and do your job regardless and do a good job, don’t expect management to ever ask how you’re doing or how you’re treatments are going because they don’t care. The younger team leaders will care and ask, but that’s about it. No opportunity for advancement unless you have been preselected by management so there’s not point in going through the process.
Union. You are forced to be part of the union since they are unionized. And their union includes seniority system which is the worst system ever. Because senior will always be priority even if they ARE BAD at their jobs. Seniority rules doesn't motivate new employee to work harder because they will never get any benefit for doing a great job. Too many managers or leads and most of them don't know what they are doing. Company is too huge and you feel like you are just another replaceable employee. Never meet the CEO and doesn't make you feel like a family.
They say family but no family atmosphere in the store
Some of the shifts are late shifts, but managers work with you on availability.
Makes me expect more from future jobs
Hours - all retail positions, especially in the grocery world, are going to come with a variety of shifts throughout the week. That is my only con.
Some people are fake-friendly as if that's part of the job requirement.
Not enough pay, bad hours, rude customers
They say family but no family atmosphere in the store
Some of the shifts are late shifts, but managers work with you on availability.
Management didn’t care Too many vacations during busy time for essential personnel
Makes me expect more from future jobs
Not enough time off for work home life
Pay was pretty low and work was hard
Hours - all retail positions, especially in the grocery world, are going to come with a variety of shifts throughout the week. That is my only con.
Management was biased Constantly want you to scan faster Weekends can be hectic
Really not that many cons
none at all like none
Not many cons at all.
The job can be physically demanding with a majority of your shift staying on your feet.
takes a long time to go anywhere with your career
On store level they want you to have an open availability. Makes it hard to work a second job if you want to support yourself without any assistance. As a lower level manager my pay is good compared to competitors I believe but for me to pay rent in my area and have a car that is reliable I need to take the extra step higher which is unfortunate because even at lower level management I have had enough stress from the job that I lost sleep. I have seen managers retaliate when an employee was expressing to leave which upset me. Company says they care about their people and should fine when someone makes an important decision to better themselves. No options for remote work if you want to move up into corporate.
I don't think I have any that were significant.
Does not have flexible hours Standardized design procedures
Say good bye to holidays.
- slow growth for those hoping to accelerate quickly
Same as other food service industries. Physically demanding. Standing all day on concrete.
Doesn't pay well, The job is not computer related,
Pay was not competitive, increases were not based on performance
some people definitely work harder than others...management has favoritism so if you play your role you'll do fine.
- It's a retail job, which brings with it all that retail entails - Not something I've experienced too much myself, but have heard there have been some communication issues between employees and management
Retail schedule to include evenings and weekends.
Haven’t seen a single thing I don’t like, employees are delighted to actually do there job , I’ve had plenty of jobs in my life and I can honestly say this is the first time I’ve seen a employer be so considerate and sweet. Apply and join the team because it’s a guaranteed you won’t regret it
There are no cons that I can think of.
Hours fluctuating during summer, management
Very repetitive and sometimes stressful
Hours can drop significantly during summer Some mix-ups during training
lonely boring fun that rooster
There isn’t as many of these as there are Walmarts
typical retail, dealing with people sucks
-Seniority based so all the best everything goes to the older employees -You start out doing the worst jobs -Starting pay isn't great -You bid for your shift and with limited options for people till later you get in shifts and bids you might not be able work with -Can be put on 10 or 8 hour bids. Then forced for 2 more hours or 4 more if emergency is called. So might be made to work 12 hour shifts. -Can be forced to work up 60 hours a week. -Your days off you only get 1 out of the 2 if on a 5 day 8 hour bid. -You bid on the shift and job.....You might not get anything you'll be able to do. -Management is a mess -Dirty -Hot in the summer and Cold in the winter
Have to deal with difficult customers, fast paced environment.
If you work full time in the bakery you will be so overwhelmed with work that you won’t have time to take a break, and management doesn’t even bat an eye. They come to expect you to work your whole shift with no break. They’ll have one cake decorator assigned to 30 cake orders on a weekend, which is inhumane. Impossible to meet all the order deadlines without working 10 hours straight. I’ve even worked 12 hours with no lunch and I never got so much as a thank you. I work so hard every day and get no recognition. The pay is pathetic, I make less than $19/hour and I saw online that even a position as school bus driver or bank teller pays significantly more!! And no employee discounts! My friends and family laugh when I tell them that we don’t get a discount but we get “employee coupons.” It’s pathetic. And the vacation time sucks! I only got 8 days my first year and then your second year it goes up to 13. Most companies START with 2 weeks! I don’t even shop at Wegmans for my groceries anymore, they’ve become too expensive and with what they pay me there’s no way I can afford it. I used to be one of those Rochestarians obsessed with Wegmans but working for them has totally changed my perspective.
- Busy holidays can be disorganized (football games and graduation are the busiest times at this location; close to Penn Sate University) - No employee discount - Sometimes you may need to deal with rude or angry customers (but this is expected in a customer service role)
Working holidays and weekends with varied hours
Management is a cult of red necks with rules for everyone but themselves Food is repetitive and unreasonably expensive If you get their prep foods at the right time, they are good to acceptable Off hours horrible freshness Most wasteful place I've seen so far while claiming to be environmentally friendly Nothing justifies their high prices
None that I can think of
Management changes frequently which can be hit or miss.
It's still a business that is trying to make money and you are a tool for that Chronically understaffed and asked to step up to make it work, but you don't get any of the benefit of that
Pay was not competitive, increases were not based on performance
low pay, boring, receptive job asa cafe busser
some people definitely work harder than others...management has favoritism so if you play your role you'll do fine.
Many departments are limited on the numbers of employees and the number of hours to be worked. At times during my employment there were occasions where my store was a ""hostile work environment"". NOT from store management or coworkers, it was the customers. It was bad, very bad during the lock-downs, shut-downs and restrictions during COVID pandemic, but not entirely to be blamed on COVID. There is a portion of the customer population that seem to be looking for any reason to take their frustrations out on low level employees that just can't do anything but ""take it"" People employed as cashiers are viewed as targets to dump upon. It's in almost any job, retail and food service seem to be especially targeted, and why so few people even want to work in them.
Can overwork you sometimes if not careful.
Nothing at all i loved working here
Hours fluctuating during summer, management
Very repetitive and sometimes stressful
lonely boring fun that rooster
long hours work weeks sun-sat; they will schedule you up to 9 days sometimes because the previous week doesn't technically count and only give one day off
There isn’t as many of these as there are Walmarts
Gets very busy, late night shifts
typical retail, dealing with people sucks
Have to deal with difficult customers, fast paced environment.
There isn't enough time in the world to list them all. Understaffed for YEARS (don't ever expect that to change,) as a senior member of the team I worked full-time hours (full-timer responsibilities) for part-time benefits, unreliable employees on a small team cause you to work on most of your days off, it's an ""office job"" but you're required to help out cashiering or at the Service Desk often which sets you significantly back on your own work that you have strict deadlines for, upper management thinks you do nothing but you're literally moving at all times if you work mornings/carry forward accounts. All in all, extremely stressful, underpaid, understaffed, under-appreciated position. I loved my job, was great at it, and consider myself a very resilient person, but it made me stress cry quite a bit if that tells you anything. There are little to no opportunities to move up to a full-time position, not only in Accounting, but in-store in general as well.
- raises get capped - no recognition for hard work - limited to no job growth -hard to keep scholarship (changed guidelines without telling recipients) -hard to transfer as a part timer -annoying work culture (bosses are always super happy, dismissive, and not understanding that your job sucks) -new bosses all the time (so no chance for growth because you barely know the people -Anti Union (which sucks because part-timers really need one) -Useless HR -Would not enforce Covid policies (but had covid paid leave) -Awful disability leave policy (nearly lost my job because HR and my department wouldn't give me a proper accommodations, or process my doctors notes for arbitrary reasons)
Bizarre, cult-like corporate culture. Gossip and bullying were rampant at all levels, and if you didn't want to participate, you became the next target. Extremely toxic, high schoolish atmosphere. Elderly and mentally disabled staff were cruelly overworked and often treated with blatant disrespect. The extreme arrogance and self-importance of management was beyond anything I'd previously witnessed in retail. These sad little people truly seemed to believe they were elite humans for outranking low-level employees (often underage, elderly, or socially/racially/physically/intellectually disadvantaged) earning poverty wages. Baggers were seldom provided, even during peak hours. As a result, cashiering was stressful and physically punishing work with a high potential to lead to physical injury. Despite being named one of the nation's ""best places to work"" by Forbes, this was by far the worst job I've ever had.

No complaints no no no no

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Meijer-Reviews-E2894.htm,"Management was helpful and courteous. Very flexible with scheduling being a college student. They had had a great rewards program for employees.
the people I worked with in the location I was at were awesome
Overall pay decent if you only do your job requirements, bad once you have to help all the departments and leave yours hanging. Bereavement time, 3-5 days depending on relation.
It's not so bad when you're a journeyman meat cutter, because they pay accordingly and generously. The nice thing about Meijer policy specifically is we don't process any poultry so you won't have to cut up chickens for anyone (you can tell them sorry, but no) and we don't make sausage either. Meijer is strictly beef and pork on the cutting block. Meat cutters, pharmacy techs and cake decorators are the three highest-paying jobs at Meijer outside of management.
The job was very easy and did not require any overtime or work outside of normal hours.
We as a store opening team were ripped off. We were promised pay rates that the store management team underhanded refused to follow through with the pay rate agreed upon during the initial interview.
Met 3 good managers they are awesome.
The scheduling was- for the most part- flexible, and almost all requests for days off were approved.
The jobs are pretty good overall
The Open Door policy which allows employees to speak to management about concerns in regard to your job or the company. Free training programs to become a manager. Completely free online Bachelors degree education benefit. Great product selection and team member discount. Acheivers mteam recognition system for extra money if recognized by other workers. Seasonal workplace events, celebrations, and holiday benefits (free food, free ).
nice people, good training, schedule posted in advance
We as a store opening team were ripped off. We were promised pay rates that the store management team underhanded refused to follow through with the pay rate agreed upon during the initial interview.
My managers and coworkers were all very friendly. Everyone tried to work together in stressful situations in order to get the work done, even if it was difficult to understand or get instruction on.
Meijer has a great culture honestly and there's no denying it; lots to learn and enjoy, and opportunity for advancement every ~6 months until you reach Level 4.
Flexible with hours, decent pay and friendly environment. Plenty of opportunities to grow.

Flexible easy fun coworkers went by fast
Benefits were better than most, generous PTO
Super chill Solid chances for promotion Fine pay
People are very understanding and very flexible for students
Working part time you can make your own schedule. But full time you have to have open availability.
Workers are easy to get along with
Very flexible hours, and the people I work with are, for the most part, great. At the store level, management is good. On the whole, they care about your issues and try to work with you to get you the hours and place in the store that's best for you. Pay is OK but not great.
Weekly pay Good benefits Competitive pay
Much more relaxed retail chain. Plenty of staffing hours, usually 3 pharmacists daily. Pharmacists at most stores encourage each other to take lunches. Some pharmacists even sit while processing, which is unheard of elsewhere. Upper management is very relaxed regarding metrics compared to other chains.
None at all. Walked out on them.

Very nice company to work for
Never take your work home with you good managers

Ok pay and some good people
Flexible in terms of your schedule as long as you are working part time
- little to no micromanaging in my department
Duties aren't hard to complete in a vacuum
If you have deli experience and want a more quiet deli this is a good spot.

Not really any pros for this job
Flexible schedule, but usually only when you are considered Part time. Management is hit or miss, thankfully I have more managers I like then I dislike.
Decent benefit package. If the manager knows how to manage properly it’s not that bad of a place for an entry level job.

Easy job, no real repercussion for mistakes other than a verbal
Great company to start an entry level pharmacy tech position. The PTU training program was very helpful and informative.
Really fun out going type of job
(Reasonable) creative license to try new designs, decent pay for decorators compared to Kroger or Walmart
It's a private company so they aren't beholden to shareholders. They do more than most to make associates feel valued.
Friendly staff, easy to get the hang of, good hours
Co-workers are great to work with.
Tuition Reimbursement Flexible Hours Nice team members
People that work there are mostly cool to talk to, flexible schedules, get to form a good work relationship with almost anyone there.

Meijer has a great team of employees.
Theyre always looking for help
Gave me pharmacy tech experience.
Friendly co-workers and team atmosphere
There is a lot of good people that work for Meijer, it what saves their reputation.
Give you the opportunity to grow
Nice people to work with
Pick day you want to work
-They're desperate enough to hire almost anyone, so if you need a job, it's there. They'll even break some of their own hiring rules and hire family and significant others into the same department. -Has insurance with dental and vision being additional options. -Has a union. It doesn't really do much but it's there...
Great team members to work with
Stock food for people to consume
Few good co-workers and leaders who care about doing a good job and being helpful team members. Decent customer interactions.

Flexible work hours. Competitive pay.
The company does a great job.
Flexible Schedule and lots of opportunities to grow.
Working 3rd shift, I was able to listen to my headphones and learn while I worked. And I was able to keep to myself for the most part. Got along great with my boss. While it was very physically demanding, I lost a lot of weight and improved my health as a result. They worked well with me when I needed a surgery to give me the time I needed. While it was tough, I think of it as a great period of self improvement overall.
Steady work and great team
People that work there are mostly cool to talk to, flexible schedules, get to form a good work relationship with almost anyone there.
There are a ton of different positions and departments so I learned a lot while I worked there. Overall, everyone was very friendly, I made a ton of friends there, and for the most part, I enjoyed my time at work. Flexible if you need PTO. And flexible on start and end times. I was part-time but had a 401K started and didn't even know. racked up around $5,000 when I left. Stressful at times but I loved my team and we always figured it out. Upper management seemed nice enough, especially the CEO Rick, he was always nice and greeted everyone when he came in.
Weekly pay( that’s it, that’s all I can think of)
Good pay, easy work, no college degree necessary, starting pay is 19.75 an hour but you can work your way up.
Meijer has a great team of employees.
","Could have been more flexible in moving to other departments.
I have a disability which makes it difficult for me to stand for extended periods of time. It also requires that I drink excessive amounts of water with added electrolytes. I was unable to have my 64oz stainless steel water bottle even after getting a note from my doctor stating that it was necessary, and the company made me get my other accommodations (no standing for more than 30 minutes) changed just so I could work. Although there is no policy stating that cashiers cannot sit, they were unwilling to allow me to stay in the position I was hired for (cashier) because a chair or stool would be a ""trip hazard"" and would not let me sign something saying I would not sue the company if I tripped because it was also a concern relating to customers, but there is no reason that a customer should be that close to the register. Instead of working with me and accommodating my reasonable requirements (allowing me to have my 64oz water bottle, allowing me to sit for ~30 minutes, etc), Meijer chose to change my position and give me a rollator (walker) - which I didn't receive until over two and a half hours into my last shift. Instead of working with my reasonable accommodations, Meijer put me on leave while waiting for updated accommodations from my doctor, then they changed my position from a cashier to a general merchandise clerk.
No balance. You have sick time they don’t tell you about so you don’t use it as a salary worker. Once you learn something in a new department they always expect it from you. No real follow up with leaders. Can be transferred to another store or another position on a whim, you get no say. If you were to discipline your staff for tardies or call offs the way they want you to, you would have no staff, you have to make your own boundaries on that. Too many systems and processes to hire, discipline, schedule, etc. Ridiculously long training process that don’t actually help train what is needed for the role.
No matter which Meijer you work at, it seems that the deli always suffers the most. A word of advice: if you apply and they ask you to work in the deli, you can give them an emphatic NO. Don't fall for it!
Pay was very low. Job was pretty boring.
Lack of fair pay killed our morale
They don't care really about your health or having a life will work people 80 hrs a week and give them 1 day off and or hardly work you and the pay max out at 15 a hr even if you have been there 30 years and they will only give you a 5 dollar gift card and a small bag of chips for your anniversary I used to love when I worked there till it went downhill with management and money came first to the company. They are rude and will laugh in your face when you stand up for yourself and they allow a manager to work there that slapped a customer before there is only 3 managers that are the best there.
In my particular position (working mostly in the back room), a lot of blame for efficiency fell onto my team.
Management are terrible. Most of them have no idea what they are doing and lash out at employees, its a trickle down effect.
Pay is bad, around $13, unless you are in specific roles. Largely management dependent which can be hit or miss. Dental benefits are not great. The organization can be inconsistent: one person tells you to do this another that. Understaffed, which could mean overtime.
not a lot of hours, the pay was ok
Lack of fair pay killed our morale
I had 30 minutes of training on my very first day before being left on my own. Whenever I had a question about something they didn't train me on, it felt as though I were an annoyance for trying to do my work correctly. Each day when I would come in for work, there were no managers in the building. I never had a note of requirements or tasks for the day and was often left to try and find work for myself since it was difficult to find anyone in the building to ask questions.
Starting pay is not great for such a detail oriented and important job handling sensitive material and information. There are numerous strict laws and procedures to follow, and the only thing stopping a technician from giving someone a medication that kills them is a double check from the actual pharmacist usually.
Wish raises could be accomplished faster.

Some customers suck but that’s just retail.

Freezer work environment and long hours
The pay is not nearly enough .
The union dues are alot
but there's a flaw in the flexibility in the hours. I asked for work days Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday from 9:30 AM until 3:00 PM and any hours Sunday. Instead I got four days of work due to seniority of other employees one week and then back to normal and then another week same thing happens. I can't rely on unpredictable pay.
Managers were really petty and unspportive.

Sometimes no Holliday pay other than that fine
Low pay as compared to other similar roles, and little real ability to advance
It's retail Your schedule will likely suck Your bonus for working hard is other peoples work
pay is not the best
Management doesn’t support you when you have a problem. Can’t move up within the company.
Not the best pay for the work
Corporate is killing the store. They are slashing hours and do not give two figs about any of the issues at the store level. Customer service is a thing of the past! Only the bottom line matters. The current push is to constantly do more with less. This makes for a very stressful work environment. As a part time employee, it means being scheduled for 5 hours instead of the 7.5 you are used to getting and being told to go home one day, then being told you MUST stay for an additional 3 hours the next. If you protest that you have made other plans, they tell you that if you don't stay, it's ""refusal to work"" and you can be terminated. This is no way to run a business.
Corporate has changed so much in the last five years for the bad. To much focus on back end instead of the customer
Hard to hire techs/keep the ones you hire, just like every other retail chain.
Everything to do about the store
Keep messing my schedule without me knowing Most of the time managers/supervisors forgetting or late on my lunch/breaks Salary is fairly low No bonuses
they struggle with communication and setting up accommodations
The job is physically demanding
pay rude customers point system
could have a better management
Will only promote you if they like you. They don't care about qualifications.
Pay is poor Ask for too much for what you are being paid Poor management
The break room tends to be a stye
Frequently get hours cut TLs won't schedule enough people Not much upward mobility
Pretty low pay compared to others. Also not super busy and you end up with time to kill which can get old fast. There was alot of drama going on while I worked and management made a rude comment on me taking a day off which is part of why I left but mainly I left to find a better opportunity for work. (They wanted to know why I was calling off I said my period and he told someone I should have just sucked it up. It’s just a disgusting comment from someone.)
Sometimes no Holliday pay other than that fine
No accountability to a point where you are rewarded for poor performance and going against your moral standard's, no leadership progression, chaotic, low wages and little effort into technology. Overall this is an aging company with horrible corporate standards and a great marketing team making it look like it's a great place to work and a great impact on the community. However it's all for pr, their involvement in the community is for tax write offs and to get close to community leaders to enhance their stance on dark store tax abatement.
People probably don't read job-site reviews for being a stocking associate at meijer, but incase you do here is a quick review. As a middle aged adult switching careers I took a part-time position at my local meijer doing overnight stocking just for alittle additional income. I worked in retail long ago as a teenager and kept an open mind going in. In my 9 months of employment before voluntarily quitting, I was the second most senior stocker for my shifts. The turnover here is incredible due to work conditions. Most people don't last a month, some not even a few weeks. You will deal with constant micromanagement even if performing well. Don't expect a team environment, you will be assigned aisles with full pallets of cases that you have a set time to have completed by. Even after memorizing locations of products and not having to refer to location stickers, you would have to quite literally run to meet these times. Ultimately, the harder you work to meet arbitrary metrics will be met with increased amounts since you could achieve the prior goal. The pallets of cases will keep getting larger and you will have no incentive to continue to damage your mind and body to pad the numbers for your store. Review is getting to more words than needed but maybe it helps someone out there deciding.
It's retail Your schedule will likely suck Your bonus for working hard is other peoples work
Uneven payment across departments, not easy to move positions
Clocking in is a pain sometimes.
Managers are accusatory and refused to help female staff
Pay is stagnant. I've only worked there for 2 years and have gotten to the highest level of leadership possible in my department just under a Team Lead. They tell me I'll never get a higher pay.
Wildly understaffed, ignorant management with no real business or management sense, they try and abuse the workers who are to timid to say NO to their manager. The store is honestly becoming a disgusting, mismanaged, box store with an overworked and insanely underpaid and appreciated staff. Meijers is a privately owned company. No shareholders to answer too. Their ridiculous price mark ups are strictly GREEDflation. God forbid the CEO of a friggin grocery chain can’t live like a king. What on earth happened to America. I hate crony capitalism.

Pay could start out better, could top out more Tend to overload some workers more than others etc.
Uneven payment across departments, not easy to move positions
Sexual harassment not taken seriously, repeated complaints about unwanted touching were met with ""he means well"", management super concerned about how long the pregnant woman used the bathroom until the pregnant woman worked herself into the ground with preeclampsia and was hospitalized. Management called after new mom was unable to return to work after baby due to health complications to announce she may have to pay back her postpartum pay
There is not much room for growth and also there isn't currently a full time position.
Not many people work here under staffed
Lack of communication among upper management (which ends up with you going back and forth between people, only to be sent right back to the other), expecting whole departments to run on skeleton crews, huge distribution issues, obsolete equipment, and getting anything for the department is like pulling teeth
Training of Team Leads is nil and they're the associates main contact. It's not great.
Slightly understaffed, not very fast paced, repetitive
Clocking in is a pain sometimes.
Standing all day Low pay
Corporate is clueless, new systems put in that no one asked for, most things don't work like they are expected to.
Sad hourly wage Annoying Managers Nepotism
Management leads and interacts emotionally.
No room for growth bb
Poor management, favoritism, sexual harassment, non-coordinating hours for life-work balance, general snobby attitudes coming from people who have been with the company for more than 2 years..
Everyone who is not a regular associate is mean and demanding.
Company is so big that it has no idea who is a good employee and management can over look the important players to their own detriment.
Not sure about the cons
Get pretty loud and hot
1.Can't leave until job done.... if low staff sucks to be you 2. As a co worker you can see other workers job history and education without asking. 3. Union doesn't really protect you from other coworkers. 4. Low pay... other companies pay better
-Short staffed and doing very little to entice new hires -Can't retain staff, new and old -Doesn't pay a liveable wage nor are they even trying to be competitive -If you work at a union store, you only get about a $0.10 raise when you work about 720 hrs. These hours reset whenever the union ""negotiates"" a small pay raise at the start of a new business year. -Equipment is constantly breaking down and the repair/exchanging process is slow or nonexistent. -Barely enforces any form of order onto customers. A customer can pretty much get what they want if they yell for a manager and threaten to call corporate enough. Very few managers feel empowered enough to tell customers no, unless they're personally provoked.
Lines Leaders are terrible at getting a schedule out 2 weeks in advance like they are supposed to.
They have poor management skills
Too many lazy individuals are not held accountable to do their full job. Everyone is treated the same and not by the work they do. Good workers feel like trash because they are seen as responsible workers while the lazy ones sit back and take advantage of the genuine work ethics of the harder-working and caring employees.
The training for actual day-to-day duties was very informal, more of a follow along and attempt to learn everything if you can. They pile on shifts during holidays and then die off on hours afterward.
Promotion is limited. Break is short.
There were no cons to working here.
Staffing shortage can sometimes add extra responsibilities on your workload.
Not many people want to work 3rd shift, so it is very understaffed and the physical work load ends up being way more taxing than should be expected of an individual to have to unload and break down an entire departments worth of product every night by yourself. But that isn't really a problem that the company can control. This was for the produce department at my particular store, which gets the biggest truck load every night. Raises are every 1000 hours you work and you are more likely to make more money getting hired in as a new employee than you are staying there and working the hours needed to get a 25-35 raise. I made more money as a new hire than some people who were great employees did, who had been there for over 7 years. It's hard to want to stay working at a company for more than a few years, when you realize people getting hired in after you who are terrible at their job and less experienced are likely getting paid more than you. At least as an hourly.
can be very people busy and overwhelming
Corporate is clueless, new systems put in that no one asked for, most things don't work like they are expected to.
Inconsistency between the stores. I think I was lucky and got a really good one, but I noticed that depending on the location there were some differences in how the stores are run and kept. Also, I wish the employee discount was better. Another con is unfortunately I worked a ton of Holidays, but hey it's retail.
Sad hourly wage Annoying Managers Nepotism
repetitive work, a lot to learn in the beginning, dealing with exhausted truckers.

High patient acuity and caseload Burnout Terrible EMR (MHSG)
Limited flexibility with increasing employee pay to compete with the private industry.
hours, travel requirements, areas where bases are located are not the best for school--
Low pay for amount of responsibility.
I would say the lack of freedom
Advancement can be very slow
Underpaid, overworked, lack of leadership decision making
Potential for furloughs is nerve wracking
lack of independence, pcs is a pain
hours life balance political bull too little pay for the amount of work
Heavy additional duties without additional pay
Management can improve, high turnover, poor promoting process. Red tape on performing daily task. Poor medical.
Antiquated, not always great leadership, stagnant, funding roadblock, bureaucratic roadblocks.
No real downside to the job
Little pay and many moves
travel, and high ops tempos
Rigid large bureaucracy, lack of flexibility
Hiring process is a long process.
Pay could be better or more competitive. Health benefits should be as good as active duty members.
Its the Federal Government. I'm sure you can figure it out
Not family friendly Away from home a lot

Antiquated, not always great leadership, stagnant, funding roadblock, bureaucratic roadblocks.
No real downside to the job
Not the career for maximizing earning potential, but if successful and frugal along the way, more than enough to thrive now and into the future.
Deployments, unable to pick assignment locations, possible long hours
Government moves slow and often matrix organization does communicate very well.
Bureaucratic nightmare that stops itself from progressing

Fairly secure job, if you perform well. Housing and car allowance are very good. Excellent corporate trainings. Very good global support functions, Microsoft Team networked.
-Pay -Benefits -Technology -Professional Development -Mobility
Great equipment and best safety training
Good work experience and field specific knowledge.
Work with many international people
There is a strong team environment, compensation is in the middle, and the company has opportunities all over the world.
2 weeks once you start
Overall good place to work for
There is plenty of overtime when the industry is booming.
I work on a team that was acquired by Halliburton. We've maintained our small business feel while delivering highly profitable products to Halliburton. This has enabled an environment that does not feel micromanaged in any way while allowing the benefits of working for such a large corporation.
The possibility to work remotely.
people are great and the culture is as well.
Vacation, bonus, time off, blah blah
Rotational Schedule Benefits Nothing else
Hybrid work schedule, average 3 days a week.
$$$$$ is good, field ops is top of the line

Good pay and hours as well as benefits
Customer Interaction Autonomy Mentor Problem Solver
When I worked here the equipment issued is brand new, everyone you're going to meet is going to be kind and make sure you're ready and equipped for the job, they also pay for your ""man camp"" so free hotel room with food, gym, shower etc. You can't find a higher paying entry level CDL job period, but don't even think about going if you have any type of injury, my feet were bad as I have several diagnosed foot injury/conditions by a podiatrist and I had to be in steel toed boots for 40 hours straight at one point and needed to quit. If you're in good health go for it, you will be away from family 3 weeks out of the month but the pay is incredible even for experienced CDL drivers. Despite any cons Halliburton is a very good company, great pay, benefits, I wouldn't hesitate to work there if my feet were able to stand it as truck driving is not what you will mainly be doing, your main job is assembling and disassembling pipes and hoses to trucks and coordinating to the pump operators where your cement levels are at. If you're fine working in the Permian Basin 3 weeks out of a month this will be a great job for you, I wish that I didn't have any injuries because it really is a great opportunity. This was the second job that I unfortunately had to quit due to foot pain so don't think it's Halliburton or Cement Operating it's just my health problem.

Can be paid well of you bring value to the table and are able to negotiate. In general you are respected if you are respectful.
The biggest pro was the benefits.
Logistics are very good, yes.
","Under paid not many incentives
Base salary is average at best, usually below average. Promotions and raises are based on how the location you work in is performing in terms of turning profits, if not good enough (which is usually the case) then you don’t get anything. I got an increase of about 12% in 4 years on my basic, no promotions. Work load is very high. No work/life balance. Expectations are excessive without any regard to personal space or time. Long term plans are unstable and spontaneous. In the end you own your career and need to push management for change, otherwise find another place to work. Local contracts in any country are bad. Need to push for expat contracts. Expect to be moved internationally every 2-4 years, this could be a pro if you like to travel. There is no regard to merit when it comes to compensation. You can be the youngest shining star in the team making the company millions of dolllars, but you won’t get compensation for it, nor any trainings, if your location is not turning good profits. Lastly, they will take advantage of you if you are straight out of university or not politically smart enough.
-Personnel are line items in expense sheets; employees must keep resumes up to date to be prepared for the inevitable oil & gas downturn which will result in indiscriminate layoffs -Cuts across segments affect everyone regardless of experience, talent, or business value
Mangment is a popularity contest only friend’s move up
No third party training. Lack of coordination and communication.
Hard to get promoted or get salary increased
Halliburton is like any other large corporation, politics, some top down mgmt at times.
Never sure of layoffs and overtime cut off sometimes immediately
There is not many cons
It’s boom and bust industry.
Not nearly enough vacation time.
Better options and alternatives for health insurance
volitile industry but you know that going in. They will run lean.
Management, promotions, career development, raises
Nepotism Lies Cloak and Dagger tactics This company does not value you, you will be lied to about everything including pay, schedule, location, and time off. Other employees will do their best to make you look bad and report to your bosses in an attempt to get you terminated. Bosses will lie to you about what your pay is they will put you down they will take other peoples words over yours. The current employees have a ""click"" and you as a the new person will not be apart of it and they will do what they can to get you fired. They are worried about another decline in the oil field and don't want to lose their job so they make it seem like you are not worthy. Just do yourself a favor and don't work here they pay the same as fast food workers, treat you worse, lie about what your schedule will be, will make up lies about you, never respond to any emails or texts you send, and then claim you make no effort to contact them. Just don't do it.
Hope to have better career development and succession plan.
Away from home a lot
Frustrating change in direction and leadership
Low pay and hard to move up with upper management
Long hours can be very demanding
The ladder is long so it’s like playing a game of telephone And poop rolls down hill so everyone gets a earfull
Long hours and days off. Hard to balance work and life. Industry is boom and bust, saw large layoffs during my time there.
Really hard to move up.
Micromanagement Industry based job insecurity Lack of promotions
Hard work-life balance quick turnaround
If no pro active mindset is adopted the job can be challenging
Did not have enough trucks for everyone, my truck was taken by someone else with several of my belongings still inside which meant instead of getting to sleep in the truck and have my own truck, I had to sleep in the passenger seat of someone else's truck.
Very slow in taking decisions
Work life balance and over time
The O&G industry goes through layoffs
Very conservative Company's preferred solution to industry downturns is layoffs
Can be political as you graduate up the levels in management
Need to consider more promotions at random times, not a scheduled review.
Bonus is minimal at times.
None other than Hard work, and unpredictable hours. It doesn't take long to see if you have what it takes or not. Oilfield cementing is a passion and a lifestyle. P
will not be hand held in the early stages
- Bypass safety procedures and regulations daily. - Plant equipment is worn down and is down more than it is running. - Management is a joke, don’t have a clue on what they’re doing. - Low pay rate.
Not worth it not worth it
Crazy hours at this facility
Treat you like just a number.
lack of HR management Only think on cost savings some leaders are workaholics
Fracking deals with carcinogenic chemicals and polluted air. HR is really bad about ghosting and not following up on questions/issues they'd say they would handle.
Highly policial, just a number to company. No work life balance, long strenuous hours

None what so ever at all. Great place
Pay return opportunity communication work time cool

When the supervisors are awake and management is sober with a headache.
Good ole boy attitude. They do reward friendships instead of hard work.
living area is difficult and has lots of turnover
The pay could be better.
Cyclical industry that experiences downturns and layoffs.
Be prepared to be gone two weeks at a time
large hard to move up or make an impact
No clarity on the long term strategy and direction of the company.
Workload. When the economy was up workload was heavy but when the economy was low workload was affected drastically. Too many layoffs.
Believes people are disposable. They do not value their employees. Way too many management personnel and too few actual workers. They do not care about keeping employees.
You have to be willing to relocate to have advancement opportunities.
No time for family only 7 days off
- Long hitches - Long hours - Sometimes dangerous environment
Pay raises are pretty minimal.
management was very bad at keeping up with employees tasks

Unstable Career Field, Location Of Facility

Salary higher at other service companies
24/7 on call when on hitch period
I do not have any at this time
Management likes egos stroked and gets you farther than hard work
Low market salary. Good benefits
Like all oilfield jobs it’s the time away from home.
Projects not interesting for data analytics
No room for growth in the GoM region if you work for Baroid. Manager roles don't become available except for every 5-7 yrs.
Pay isn't great. Schedule is crap.
i have found no cons so far
none at this time for the management team
No life balance no work schedule everyday is a random start and end time.
Management, no life-work balance, and pay. Some management will gripe you out and treat you poorly. They promise you life-work balance, then try to require you to work 7 days a week. Pay should be higher to meet industry standard, plus they'll hire someone and give them the same pay as the guy who's been there for five years. On top of that, there's no incentive to work harder or get more production done - you'll make the same as the guy hiding in the bathroom playing on his phone for half the day.
Old school leadership, hard to innovate
In certain groups, delocalized/abstracted management/work from home means a lot of money is wasted, and extra strain is placed on lower level staff to perform well due to lack of process improvement. Favoritism and old boy does happen at certain levels.
Some of the most toxic and unprofessional managers I have ever dealt with are still employed there. In many cases, it wasn't about what you knew but who you knew. It was an ego contest between leadership and data integrity that continued to go downhill because of poor management knowledge of the business. Employee morale was very low and Halliburton HR screens the applications more than the managers that should be involved do. By doing this, they basically only hire for leadership roles based on your degree and not your experience in the Halliburton business. The hiring process was absolutely discouraging, many times I was stuck training the managers and leads that were hired for the job I applied for instead of being promoted within the department.
None that I can see as too much
"
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SAIC-Reviews-E41130.htm,"MULTIPLE programs to support and take care of employees. They are NOT all about the bottom line/dollar, but about taking care of their people FIRST in order to make sure the job gets done! For example, they offer a PTO Donation Bank for Disabled Vets, extra time off that you can use when your injuries act up!
The management team I report to are genuinely interested in the happiness of their employees and encourage advancement/learning.
Stability and Security: Companies typically provide a stable work environment with a regular paycheck. This stability can be reassuring, especially if you have financial obligations or dependents. Career Development Opportunities: Companies often have well-defined career paths and provide opportunities for growth and advancement. You can gain new skills, take on more responsibilities, and progress in your chosen field. Learning and Skill Development: Many companies offer training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities to help employees enhance their skills. You can learn from experienced colleagues, participate in professional development programs, and expand your knowledge. Networking: Working at a company allows you to interact with a diverse group of professionals, including colleagues, clients, and industry contacts. Building a strong professional network can open doors to new opportunities, collaborations, and career growth. Benefits and Perks: Companies often provide various benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, and other perks like gym memberships, commuter benefits, or flexible work arrangements. These benefits can contribute to your overall well-being and work-life balance.
For recent graduates or others who have a basic knowledge of computers, it is a good way to start. I was able to get hands on experience , improve my customer service skills, and gain a lot more patience with people.
Starting off, pay is good. Interesting material and projects, get to work with very smart people Benefits as far as Medical, and Retirement are nice, keeping in line with industry norms. Even Stock purchase program is a nice bonus
Lots of on the job training Flexible schedules
Good pay, excellent work environment.
Rock Solid benefits due to how huge the company is. I only ever dealt with like 2 people at SAIC periodically. I think if you get a good manager, that's all that really counts towards your perception of SAIC. We had a good manager. They also have a huge library of free courses you can take. They also were kind enough to pay for my SCRUM certification by incorporating it into our work and adding it as a requirement for the position.
Great compensation Flexible work schedule Managers care about their employees Lots of Diverse work opportunities
My experience will vary from others due to the SAIC contract I was attached to. The Pros while under SAIC were Remote Work (depending on position), flexible-ish work schedule, and the people at mid to low level management.

SAIC always puts their employees first. How can work life improve for the employees? How can work life balance be what everyone is happy with? How to ensure the work provided is the best it can be? SAIC leadership answers all these for their employees and delivers at an exceptional level. Leadership ensures each employee is in position to be the best they can be for the customer. Great benefits as the cherry on top.
People are willing to help and are knowledgeable
Great professional no-nonsense organization. The leadership has great decision making capability and know how to treat their top team members.
Administrative back-end is pretty good. Comp leave benefit is about as good as it gets. Pay is competitive.
Competitive pay based on national job market
SAIC offers a flexible work schedule to most employees. This really contributes to an even better work/ life balance. Management is super supportive and ALWAYS has your back.
- Great coworkers and Team leads who are always willing to assist and teach. - You feel like you're making a difference in peoples days. - Availability of shifts are pretty good as it is a 24/7-365 work environment. - Many remote possibilities in the US and surrounding territories.
Great work life, engaging leadership, lateral and centralized team culture, great forum and platform to exchange ideas

Most of the people I worked with here are great and those who stuck around have the ""all one team"" model. People are generally willing to help each other succeed but unfortunately, unless they're all on the same contract, they have to do it on their spare time. All of the leaders I've worked with are reasonable and listen well. Clients are great too!
Great work life, engaging leadership, lateral and centralized team culture, great forum and platform to exchange ideas
They take care of their people, salary is great and plenty of lateral mobility.
Get to learn a lot
Good entry level job for new people and fairly stable company
Leadership cares and the company has programs to help you succeed.
I have been in the defense industry for 25 years and have worked for 5 different companies from small to very large. This is by far the best place I have ever worked. The SAIC culture is agile and not stagnant, they move and pivot according to the needs of the people, company and nation. They think outside of the box and do not punish you for wanting to execute change. Leaders are respected and not micro-managed and we have the ability to run our teams as we see fit. Nazzic is one of the best CEOs I have encountered.
• Pay • Colleagues • Benefits
Remote work options are great. Flex time is the best. Work/Life balance is fabulous.
Benefits are good. Colleagues are easy to work with.
SAIC is very employee focused with flexible schedules and great benefits. Their pay scale is competitive, but… (See cons) There are many opportunities and a wide variety of fields to find a work home at SAIC.
Good pay and benefits. Management at all levels cares about the workforce.
Big company with good benefits package and opportunities for career growth through internal transfers
There are so many reasons why I have been here for 10+ years and plan on staying until I retire in another 15~ years. A few reasons why SAIC is so great - management. I have had a few managers and each one got better the longer I stayed. I stay here for that reason alone; flexible schedule - so many ways to flex your time including working from home and SAIC being ahead of this curve, almost my entire career I have been remote. Growth opportunities - I have been promoted from individual worker to people manager. Salary - for someone who has been here so long I still feel I am compensated where I should be. Sometimes being at one company for a long time you can get behind in the cost of living. Not here, not in my job! And a ton more reasons - focus on diversity and inclusion, employee well being, clear company and leadership goals, accountability. I could go on and on.
When I was with the company, you could invest in the company by buying stocks.
I have an excellent boss, a wonderful, hard-working, and competent team, AND I like what I do. That in itself is enough for me to be happy, but on top of that, I feel that the company actually cares about its employees which is a departure from every other company I've worked for. We get to enjoy flex schedule options, there's a lot of support and encouragement to participate in Employee Resource Groups (which I really love being a part of!), we embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion (not just pay lip service to it), and there are learning options, newsletters, and panel discussions (such as one I recently enjoyed on Environmental & Social Governance). It makes my work experience more enriching because it's not just about the job. For me, it creates greater meaning by adding more color and depth to my day-to-day. Did I mention the benefits are also good and I get to work entirely from home which works VERY well for me? I feel very fortunate for being employed here and I don't anticipate leaving any time soon!
Work Life balance Flexibility Office location
Good team to work with
Clear mission Able to tailor hours to my preferences, early in- early out. Family environment at work, great co-workers that function as a team Excellent Supervisors, no micro-management, free to customize the way the work is handled to make it more efficient. Relaxed open door policy, all higher-level management are approachable and willing to listen to ideas and implement changes that make sense.
Great place to work , work environment is very open
I work as a part of a high performing team where excellence matters.
- Cannot comment much on pros. Did not stay long enough to experience them if there are any. -No oncall rotation for the team I joined. -Hiring compromised and worked within my requested salary.
I work with smart, hardworking people, and I enjoy the work we do. On the ground level, people genuinely seem nice. You can definitely learn a lot working here.
As a big contractor SAIC provides a great IN for newer IT professionals. They were my first Corporate Job, hiring me without a degree and then paid for me to get my BA.
Supportive management/ team leads Opportunity to move within company Good PTO
Room for growth Competitive compensation
Variety of contracts, fringe benefits
Pays well with copious training opportunities. A lot of really talented and smart people are apart of this organization. Inspiring mission and solid culture, as a company the SAIC brand is top notch.
Good company, takes good care of the team.
Relative transparency in salary negotiation process.
1. Salary is competitive for a ""big"" company. 2. Benefits are in-line with other competitors and may actually be a bit better if you're in the ""fringe"" package.
Good and perfect place to enjoy and asa well as work
~24k people employed by SAIC, so good chance of finding another job if you don’t like the one you have Benefits are okay Good management Competitive pay Flexible on taking leave
MULTIPLE programs to support and take care of employees. They are NOT all about the bottom line/dollar, but about taking care of their people FIRST in order to make sure the job gets done! For example, they offer a PTO Donation Bank for Disabled Vets, extra time off that you can use when your injuries act up!
Great place to work. Believes in Work/Home life balance.
The people who work for SAIC are consistently much nicer and harder working than most government contractors.
Amazing company. Amazing coworkers, amazing benefits. Loved working here!
Flexible schedules Low stress environment Low Expectations its a ""show up and do your job and leave"" kind of place
Flexibility, awesome team camaraderie, hours
Good benefits package for their industry
Management is great. Salary is even better. Career growth and opportunity has been awesome. I love SAIC!
Flexible work schedules to include 4-day work weeks when projects and customers allow Robust training opportunities are available, including tuition reimbursement, but the availability of this is dependent on asking your leadership for access to training resources. (bad leaders don't push training)
Definitely recommend for anyone interested in government contracting
Pay is great and I’ve been treated well.
My direct team was fun. Blunt and not always polite but everyone respected each other as a SME and disagreement would never be taken personal.
Flexibility, remote work, small team
Great Team, Great collaboration, Awesome opportunities.
Decent health benefits, paid holidays, floating holidays, very flexible work schedule (WFH), maternity leave, etc. Strong culture of moving you to new opportunities within the company to advance your career.
- Exposure to a lot of different applications which allow you to learn a lot of different types of hardware and software stacks. - Management is awesome (Early 2022 unsure if the same management is still there or is different now, but our leadership was amazing when I worked there) - Willing to assist in gaining a clearance - Funds education - Very competitive wages - 80 hours required for 2 weeks, can move it around pretty freely - if you work over 96 hours in 2 weeks you can add each hour worked after to your PTO
Great work environment and nice people
Flexible and steady job. Pretty interesting problems to solve if you get into the right team
Lots of opportunities to progress
Competitive Pay for the industry
It's a job and it pays well.
Learned A lot Easy requesting time off
Flexible work environment at times
Diverse portfolio of work. Solid pay.
SAIC prides itself on the growth of their employees and strives to excel in their mission, vision and purpose. They are an amazing company to be a part of and offer exceptional benefits, learning opportunities, and compensation. I am very proud to be an employee and continue to grow and excel within the company which in turn allows me to provide a wealth of knowledge and well-rounded experience to the customers I support.
It was fine. There was a good work/life balance.

Good pay, and good options for roles.
Great team, good benefits, flexible
SAIC is a good company with good people and many opportunities.
Great benefits, schedule flexibility that allows for a very healthy balance of work and home life which I've never experienced before this job, tons of opportunity to do so much. We're treated with respect and everyone is friendly. It's not a toxic environment and there's no pressure to be someone you don't want to be. Most issues get resolved quickly. The team that I'm in the field with has completely made all the difference in the world in making sure I have the tools I need to be successful. I enjoy waking up for work and it feels really good.
SAIC cares about its people and sees them as the best asset. Great company, great benefits.
Take care of people and provides the ability for growth thru different contracts
My direct team was fun. Blunt and not always polite but everyone respected each other as a SME and disagreement would never be taken personal.
I had a car wreck and seven healthy shoes and the companies that buy me the entire time. I love pleasure to work there with you. Liar moment that made me feel like it actually mattered. The pay was good for my area. OK I am very proud to have worked there and Wood recommend it to anyone.
I enjoy working for a large government contractor. There are plenty of ways to move around in order to benefit yourself.
The people, benefits, goals of the company.
Flexibility, remote work, small team
","Nothing beyond the usual amount of paperwork in order to fulfill obligations and tracking of products/jobs.
The company tries to encourage cohesion within teams but with the amount of remote and hybrid work it is hard to accomplish a good working relationship.
Limited Autonomy: Working in a company often means adhering to established policies, procedures, and hierarchies. This can limit your autonomy and decision-making authority, requiring you to follow guidelines set by management. Office Politics: Companies are made up of diverse individuals with different perspectives and motivations. Office politics and internal conflicts can sometimes arise, affecting workplace dynamics and potentially causing stress or tension. Lack of Flexibility: Some companies may have rigid work schedules and limited flexibility in terms of working hours or remote work options. This can pose challenges for individuals who prefer more flexible arrangements or have personal obligations that require flexibility.
Since you are a subcontractor, the pay is not the best, but you do get benefits. It is a very fast paced environment & can be stressful. They use more of a 'baptism by fire"" training method. You get 3 weeks of training how to create tickets, and they sometimes have learning sessions, but you will feel like you were just dumped in without a safety net. If you plan to apply for this job, get you Security + first. That will allow you to obtain admin rights, which is so much better than having to ask a team leader everything. Do not be late to work or leave early, even one minute early. They really pay attention to attendance. Get there early to have time to get your computer started, because you have to be on the phone at the time you are scheduled.
VERY hard to advance your career. Not many remote positions, and any that are available are already taken by employees that the requirements are tailored to. If you're looking to advance up a ladder, good luck. If you have a family, you should probably look elsewhere. The pay starting out is great, but keep in mind, the contract you're working on has a set amount for yearly increases. You won't get paid more if you do better work than anyone else, it'll be dependent on the contract. Bonuses are communicated when signing on, but they're non-existent. They're for the Program directors and above. Also the PTO is terrible. Starting out you have 2 weeks of PTO. Good luck if you have a family and want to take time off for vacations or even catching a baseball game or golf on a nice day. Keep in mind, you're working mostly with the government, so when they say jump, and you ask how high, they'll answer you 3 months later, but wanted your jump done 4 months earlier.
In person on naval base, security and traffic daily
Leadership in this 1 department didn't know how to manage a particular department for the Federal partners.
The ISSAIC portal needs a lot of improvement, Thats about it. But I am biased because I am a web developer.
As SAIC became larger and larger, they also had to get more and more competitive. To do this, they had to take away things such as bonuses, some amount of PTO, etc. Cost of insurance went up (but this can be said for almost all companies)
Under this customer, job duties and personnel whom I was responsible for continued to increase without compensation. More senior management positions were created/hired outside of the organization or from other SAIC contracts instead of from within this contract. This was at a time where the organization needed more hands on personnel vice chiefs. Managing customer expectations or agreeing to everything the customer thought they wanted at a moment's notice without any plan of action became annoying a huge point of contention. Being told ""you are not paid to think. you are paid to do what you are told"" when bringing up a concern that could have negatively impacted our highest concentration of VIPs did little to garner trust that upper management of the program had a firm grasp on this key responsibility of senior management.
Since you are a subcontractor, the pay is not the best, but you do get benefits. It is a very fast paced environment & can be stressful. They use more of a 'baptism by fire"" training method. You get 3 weeks of training how to create tickets, and they sometimes have learning sessions, but you will feel like you were just dumped in without a safety net. If you plan to apply for this job, get you Security + first. That will allow you to obtain admin rights, which is so much better than having to ask a team leader everything. Do not be late to work or leave early, even one minute early. They really pay attention to attendance. Get there early to have time to get your computer started, because you have to be on the phone at the time you are scheduled.

Not a con specifically for SAIC but contracts in general. Hard to be promoted and moved up when the monetary constraints of contracts limit what great employees can be paid. Great employees are what keep companies great and moving in a positive direction. Pay the great ones what they are worth. It will retain or entice great leaders/employees to be a part of the team for the lomg haul.
Pay structure needs to be reviewed
Can be tricky to navigate the various programs and opportunities, does require the right person that is motivated to own their role and career.
Not so good for part-timers. Poor benefits even at 30 hours. Not active in DEIA organizations like Out and Equal Workplace Partners.
Not enough focus on training personnel. Lean heavily on employees just figuring out how things work.
I have yet to find a downside to working at SAIC.
- Pay could be better for hourly workers as the job requires a clearance or the ability to get one. - Work can be stressful at times, handling upset customers (As is normal in Tech support).
Senior leadership is across the country and probably won't have an opportunity to meet in person. Otherwise, there are zero cons.

The company operates with such low margins that there's no money or staff development or training. If you want to take a class or help someone on a different contract, you have to do that on your own time. Everything needs to be billable to the client or charging time to a proposal code while working on proposals. This impacts the quality of work and we loose good people. If you are a full time employee working on a contract here and the contract ends, you need to assume you'll be treated like this is a staffing agency . Find your next gig / job in 2-3 weeks while you use up your comp leave or your paychecks will stop. Sometimes supervisors happen to have a good personal network to help you but don't expect that. So, if you come to work here, make sure your supervisor is great at networking. The company systems that help full time employees find other opportunities if their contracts end are terrible. It's literally a spreadsheet on sharepoint. They also have no bench so those employees whose contracts are ending are usually told to start using comp leave while looking for a new job internally. So they are looking for work WITHIN the company while taking their vacation time. There is no sick leave. When your 3-4 weeks of comp leave runs out, you're fired and stop earning the next day. I've been sorry to see a number of amazing people exit because we couldn't keep them 100% billable and they experienced a short gap of 4 weeks between projects. The company is good at selling and billing the client accurately but not investing in the people who deliver on those promises. If you're not interested in sales .. just know that you are a cog here.
Senior leadership is across the country and probably won't have an opportunity to meet in person. Otherwise, there are zero cons.
Company is very large so climbing the ladder can be challenging.
Very busy, no down time
Pay is low for the market
None that I can think of.
The downside is the way bonuses are distributed. We need a bonus structure for Directors and we need a way to reward those that do not qualify for SPOT awards. Budgeting is also allocated via generic guidance versus truly understanding needs. We need to be able to grow in the right places and the way the budget works here, is they go off of historical spend versus who really needs dollars. So when we want to grow, inefficient orgs are rewarded for past high spending and efficient orgs are punished for being fiscally conservative.
• Workload was pretty high
Some of the DEI training is too much.
There's no leadership or upward mobility.
While they’re payscale is competitive, it becomes less competitive the longer you are with the company. It can be difficult to “move up”, and due to the nature of government contracting, it can be easy to get stuck in pools of complacency.
I spend half my time attending ineffective meetings.
My experience was that the company made high-level decisions about company direction/finances and then you're just kind of tossed around as a individual contributor
Honestly cannot think of any. I could not be prouder to work for SAIC!
The company was going through a transition and a lot of employees had to find new positions.
I can't think of anything.
Commute when in person ( mostly remote now)
Company was large so not a lot of feedback from corporate
On-boarding was tough as all were busy and I was left to figure much out on my own, but management fixed that afterwards. Initially a bit of a wall between contractors & military folks, but with a small amount of patience that has been easy to tear down.
No cons I’ve only been a few months
I wish I worked here sooner.
-Onboarding is comprised of two portions; general onboarding that describes how to use the absurd timecharging/timesheet system (required even if you're salary). Then role specific training; this can vary between teams but was awful and was not useful, as the teams role has pivoted within the year and training was still being developed and reviewed by the time two new employees joined. -Management seemed to not have any engineering experience. This affected knowledge sharing and resolving deep dive issues that required authority and high level understanding of said issues. -Recruitment was very shallow and not fleshed out. The interviews did not include peer engineers and administrators to conduct a technical evaluation of skills for hiring (due to schedule confliction or general absence), thus candidates were unable to determine the skill level of this job and knowledge required for this position through technical questions. -Day 1 communication was severely lacking. You receive an outline of general onboarding and no communication from your point of contact, so it leaves you confused on any required documentation needing to be processed by other teams or agencies. This affects many components when starting, as you need certain approvals to perform your role. -How job performance and reviews were not described at all. This left employees in the dark on how opportunities and growth projection is conducted.
The recruiting/hiring process was dishonest about the nature of the work and did a lot of lying by omission. The team regularly works over their hours, including on weekends, late nights or early mornings, none of which was presaged in the interview/recruiting process. The management have no idea hard the team is working or how long things take, and regularly add helpful new ""tools"" aka new hoops for us to jump through.
Growth opportunities. At least in my exp, moving out of your lane to get more exp is easy, but getting raises is HARD. You've have got to advocate for yourself and your pay and be willing to leave if the answer is no. I was under paid for almost two years as I cross-trained and then got my degree. Was told I would have the chance to negotiate pay and then was pushed (from a junior) to a Mid-Tier position with no pay increase. Was months from getting degree so couldn't afford to reject. I took an offer at another company a week after getting my BA. Senior Management VERY detached from contracts' employees day to day.
Experience differs depending on what contract you are on
Can't think of one at the moment
Limited ability to take paid time off
Some front line and mid level managers are out of touch with reality related to their area of responsibility.
However, there is no profit share
Raises are not available. Bonuses are discussed, but I've rarely seen them used. The only increase I ever received since starting in 2019 is when I left for a period of time and then came back. There are employees that have been fired and are now making 40% more doing the same work for a different company. It begins to impact your desire to excel and go above and beyond when there is no reward for your efforts.
1. First line management, called Section Manager, is weak. All they do is just approve timesheet and don't really have regular conversations with their team. 2. For a company so big, it's not always easy to ""move around"" and find opportunities. 3. If you receive customer recognition, there isn't a monetary award given.
Heavy work to do there
Only 2 weeks of PTO, which includes sick leave Not many fully remote jobs Their intranet for employees is a black hole & can be hard to find information you need; use super outdated timesheet software
Nothing beyond the usual amount of paperwork in order to fulfill obligations and tracking of products/jobs.
I have no cons with SAIC.
Low yearly raises and hard to understand merit system.
Only con was the transition to having no office desk due to downsizing space (because of everyone working from home).
Upper Managment (Rymes with James Fallen) is out of touch with what it takes to manage people properly The management higharchy is muddy so sometimes you have 3 bosses.
I can't think of anything
Raises are restricted based of government contract
I work remote so I have never met my team in person
If you have a bad team, then you are not going to enjoy your life, and training opportunities are going to be minimal. You can pretty much tell if you have a good manager by how they respond to your asking for additional training or certification opportunities.
Nothing to mention, I am a remote worker
Contractor for the gov and all that goes along with that.
As a female, and the only female on my team, it was like working in a men's locker room, everyone felt it was OK to make offensive comments and some clearly got further in career by unprofessional relationships. There was a click of some very senior execs and if you find your way in ton , then you can do no wrong. Reorg is annual and it always happens before annual review so new supervisor doesn't have info/ reason to give bonus or keep you on the team at all. If you do get a bonus most of it is stock and they take it back when you leave or are let go regardless of reason.
Pay could be better. Overworked most of the time.
Typical contract work. Once in raises and income increases very little.
Your experience with SAIC is heavily dependent on who your manager is and what program you are on. These views are not reflective of the company as a whole, but I hope the review helps the company realize that improvements can definitely be made. I had 3 managers during my time there on 2 programs. Poor leadership by junior management was not corrected by senior management and proved to make the work environment toxic and stressful. Although there were many opportunities for improvement on this particular team of the program, management/culture within program resisted change and held the attitude of ""stay in your lane"" whenever associates would push the status quo to make improvements. Because internal career movement is encouraged within SAIC, sometimes associates who are poor performers or poor fits for a particular position get reassigned to a different program just for the sake of retaining that employee. This can have a negative effect on the other team members as well as that employee.
- Some people didn't like the on-call. I personally didn't mind it as you would be given a week or two as a team of 7-14 so usually you would only be on call 1 or two days during that time span. - Sometimes you had no knowledge of how to fix an application due to poor documation (has greately improved over the time I was there)
Not many opportunities for mobility
No decent overtime so some hours you work ""overtime"" count for nothing until a certain threshold. no sick comp, so vacation/sick days are lumped together.
The budget for raises is nonexistent while the budget for new hires is quite competitive.
Cronyism is rampant in the higher branches of the company. Their training of ""See Something, Say Something"" is just window dressing and ethics is questionable at best. It is dangerous if you are calling out the toxic behavior of someone in the good 'ol boys club. Human Resources is did absolutely nothing to address the toxic behavior and is only there to po protect the company rather than manage ethical standards. Rather than hold management accountable, the seek out the low hanging fruit as a way of addressing the issues. If you are a highly skilled female engineer, SAIC is not a company you want to invest in; at least this is true for the EDIS contract.
You will be lowballed for compensation, the company doesn't see you as a person, and money will be the go-to solution for all problems.
Pay Benefits No bonus checks
Project deadlines can be stressful
Experience will be hit or miss depending on your contract.
I do not have any cons with SAIC.
There were no cons at this company.
Delivery milestones tied more to internal rather than external deadlines
Work life balance started great but later it changed had to start coming in on weekends due to a committee that audits us

government contract work is not steady opportunities
Demanding call queue in the busy season ( Spring / Early Summer )
Upper Managment (Rymes with James Fallen) is out of touch with what it takes to manage people properly The management higharchy is muddy so sometimes you have 3 bosses.
My experience has been rife with bad management. I’ve gone through 5 PMs in less than 4 years.
Low starting pay, hard to move up.
Salary is lower than I would like.
Sometimes it feels like there are many missed opportunities where Field training could be capitalized on, with respect to how many different systems we work with. I feel like my onboarding time could have been better spent in the field under instruction. But I've managed to get what I need by staying super flexible.
None come to mind actually. This is a wonderful company
Company needs new and younger workforce

Strict time management is required. The pay could have been better however for this area it was not bad.
Very large company so it makes it a challenge to meet the higher ups.
Processes change too often. Some big changes made without full considerations imo.
Pay could be better. Overworked most of the time.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Express-Employment-Professionals-Reviews-E11188.htm,"They are great at making you think you are apart of a team that cares for their employees and associates.
Some good incentives but if you don't perform you'll feel the pressure and criticism from upper management.
There are plenty of jobs listed on the website and the staff is very polite.
Complete Schedule Autonomy. I loved being able to essentially work when I wanted, it gave me the freedom to take vacations or learn new skills. Not to mention the constant & consistent base raises to compete with the industry.
They were able to have me working within days of signing up with them. The assignment was interesting
A company that is driven to excellence through it's value system and sense of morals. They truly want to help both: people find solid companies to work for, and companies to find solid employees to work for them.
-Good exposure to how interviews are conducted, what the job market is like, what recruiters look for in candidates, etc. -Learning what your clients (companies) do with their jobs, and developing strong relations and connections to these contacts in a professional setting -Entry-level, though a bit of a learning curve if it's the first professional job you're getting into
Express really cares about Employee Development. Every day you learn something new that can be added to your skillset. You are challenged and motivated almost every day. If you want to go into internal sales like me, the sky truly is the limit for how much you can succeed.
Always willing to go out on limb for their clients
Good at finding picky workers what they are looking for.
Was able to get work quickly and as long as you show up on time, you can keep working.
It Gets the bills paid, but you’ll live check too check. Have faith & it’ll work out !

I loved some supervisors more than others. I don’t believe in the micromanaging type of people. I believe in empathy and great character. Most supervisors helped me if you had questions yet some where more understanding than others. Pay was weekly.
This is a diverse, inclusive family within Express. The training is top notch and just a generally great group of people across the franchise.

Such a great place to work!
It is a good company
Each office is franchised, so you won't get the same experience. This means some run really well, and can have great teams/job offerings for associates based on region. The trainings are good and thorough.

","Poor management from leadership No business structure Low pay High turnaround internally Sexist, fatphobic, and racist owner Refuses to adapt to technology and modern business practices. High stress because policy is ever changing for no reason Lack of discipline in the office when people make big mistakes (One of their Employment Specialist spent time in prison for embezzlement.) Most toxic place I've ever worked.
You are promised to work from 8-5 but then the workload has you working weekends and late hours. If you are a minute late you get ""warnings"" but if you work extra hours and weekends there is no appreciation. The pay is not worth the amount of work or stress. The environment is similar to high school. Constant drama and criticism. Fights in office. Upper management was looking into cutting down lunch from 1 hr to 30 minutes. If your associates complain about unfair treatment at work, upper management turns the other cheek.
The jobs that are unavailable are still listed on the app, which is misleading. It’s very difficult to find a decent paying assignment.
I don't really have any. I understood the terms of my employment & I was ok with it. I guess the only downside is really no guarantee of hours but that was stated upon hiring & I was ok with it.
When I needed their help, they were slow to respond The assignment turned into another position
Requires lot of problem solving and pivoting.
-Poor management expectations, often leading to feeling unsupported at times or overworked -Numbers-driven (can be good or bad depending on the employee. Some people are motivated by it, some dread it...I'm in the latter, sadly) -Lack of room for growth -Points like these can lead to inconsistency and high turnover in the workplace
Can be incredibly stressful at times.
Didn't seen any concerns or cons
Unprofessional mess. Tried to cut my pay retroactively when it was discovered I was working the wrong position. I don't know if it was Express or the client, but it was not handled well and never should have happened. Also screwed up and did not pay me for my first day. Had to tell the office staff multiple times to remove me from the assignment then stop calling me. Too many phone calls and getting corrections on the next check. I like the idea of the service Express provides with so many job openings to sort through, but this was a horrible experience. Will be going elsewhere.
Minimum wage isn’t enough to care for my family so I needed another job.
If you work in a small office, it’s not much room for growth.

Breaks were short. Since it was work from home communication was hard because of the unexpected technology issues.
Multitasking is necessary and attention to detail. If you do not possess those skills, this might prove a difficult field to work in

No much growth potential. No rights. Changes are daily and unpredictable. Bad communication.
Salaried, so we work lots of hours
I have no complaints with express pros
Don't waste their time if you are not going to show up for your assignment.

No guidance. Staff had no answers when it came to training, scheduling, and were hard to reach when questions arised. Mislead how schedules would be handled. It was literally the hungry games picking shifts. High anxiety. This was a long term contract assignment. This was not the first time this agency had a contract with this company but it was handled like it was the first time. Two years before a dollar raise.
The owner could definitely invest more on the location. The building was old, smelly and just looked very outdated. No career progression or true leadership guidance. If you can pick up the phone and make calls, that's the job for you.
Bad pay, outdated business model, minimal room to grow.
Not many good paying jobs wants to work with a talent agency. Each Express franchise has it's own way of running things, but they all share 1 reputation, and the owners don't seem to get that. If one location hires for crap jobs, then businesses assume they all do and don't wanna work with us. Most the people in my office have a highschool mentality, including the owners.

No work/life balance. Asked to check emails and call outs from employees on the weekend with no compensation given. If asked, it was denied. Given a “leadership title” like senior employment specialist with no compensation or any form of gratitude. I know each franchise owner is different but when it comes to compensation, they’re all the same. CHEAP PAY for all the work and issues! No Employment Specialist last more than 2-3 years due to the fact that we’re doing 3 jobs in 1! Senior employees paid less than new employees coming in. Constantly called when taken a sick day— the franchise owner would make it a habit to call you when you call out sick and even worse has the audacity to have you work from home when you’re sick!!! No boundaries whatsoever—
1. High-Pressure Environment: As a recruiter, you will be working in a very fast-paced and high-pressure environment, with tight deadlines and expectations for meeting targets. 2. Hours: Depending on the needs of the business, you may be expected to work long hours, including early mornings and evenings. 3. Stressful Workload: As a recruiter, you may have to deal with a high volume of work, with deadlines and tight timelines. This can be a very stressful job.
Frustrating, repetitive, boring , Fire people
I can't think of anything.

Commision is reliant on multiple other people doing their jobs. I was laid off after generating a ton of business because they couldn't afford to pay my commissions.

It was literally the hungry games picking shifts. High anxiety. This was a long term contract assignment. This was not the first time this agency had a contract with this company but it was handled like it was the first time. Two years before a dollar raise.
return to office sucks, but no different than anyone else
The owner could definitely invest more on the location. The building was old, smelly and just looked very outdated. No career progression or true leadership guidance. If you can pick up the phone and make calls, that's the job for you.
Bad pay, outdated business model, minimal room to grow.
Not many good paying jobs wants to work with a talent agency. Each Express franchise has it's own way of running things, but they all share 1 reputation, and the owners don't seem to get that. If one location hires for crap jobs, then businesses assume they all do and don't wanna work with us. Most the people in my office have a highschool mentality, including the owners.
for my personal experience there were no cons to this employer
If you don't like a fast pace and reaching goals, this will not be a good fit
No work/life balance. Asked to check emails and call outs from employees on the weekend with no compensation given. If asked, it was denied. Given a “leadership title” like senior employment specialist with no compensation or any form of gratitude. I know each franchise owner is different but when it comes to compensation, they’re all the same. CHEAP PAY for all the work and issues! No Employment Specialist last more than 2-3 years due to the fact that we’re doing 3 jobs in 1! Senior employees paid less than new employees coming in. Constantly called when taken a sick day— the franchise owner would make it a habit to call you when you call out sick and even worse has the audacity to have you work from home when you’re sick!!! No boundaries whatsoever—
I dont have any cons at this time.
None at all ...it's all pro with express
Unstable, not loyal to employees
I'm unable to think of any cons.

Where to start? The guy running the office creates a hostile work environment. He talks AT you and not WITH you. Their philosophy is to put someone in the seat (they phrase it differently; it rhymes with pass); they don't care about experience; they fill and bill.
Nepotism Business Unprofessional Inappropriate comments from management High workload zero reward No employee appreciation whatsoever
Lack of availability of jobs I desired

None. It is perfect to me
Cliental can be difficult, conflict is daily High turnover rate due to being too stressful
There email messaging can be improved.
nothing I love my job
There is no cons this company is awesome
nothing that I can think of
nothing, they work so hard and are so committed
Not for someone that works at slow pace or like to have a lot of downtime.
Can easily be laid off due to changing production needs
Light duty was a joke. The supervisors lied and called me a thief even when I showed a receipt. I was setting aside items at work I wanted to purchase then was accused of being a thief even though I paid for them at check out. Supervisor told me to clock in at 7 or 730am even if late, so I did a couple times within a few weeks. Since I humiliated the false accuser in front of the other Temps on light duty because of injuries, the woman Amanda at Catholic Charities made me leave yelling at me ""this relationship is over!"" She followed me outside and down the side walk and tried to listen in on my phone calls. I told Jason at Express, gave my report and he terminated my employment. I have 4 kids and now no way to pay my bills. I begged him to just let me go back to Rural King and stay off light duty. By the way, it took a few days before I could even talk to him since he was avoiding having to see my face...like a coward.
Some jobs were back breaking
Lies, subjecting of women, racism against africans
Sometimes no work on slow months.
There truly aren’t any cons!
Work from home is not allowed
Each office is franchised, so you won't get the same experience. There is no uniformity or standards to level out each franchise--each office can run their business how they want to, and thus, you will have offices getting away with some crazy stuff. This can reflect poorly on the reputations of other franchises. If the office brings in money, corporate doesn't care. Your franchise owner isn't required to offer benefits, and you can't get them through corporate. The associates working have better benefits than us.
Management sucked, and working for commission is not a good idea, especially when your boss wont give you any commissions for a whole quarter
No vacation pay, only sick pay
Held weekly meetings over our lunch break, not optional. All training is expected to be done over lunch. When I asked to be paid or given lieu for my time they said too bad. Promoted from recruiter to employment specialist when they needed it but wouldn't actually give me a new contract to sign for the promotion. Toxic leadership with yelling in the office when you have questions and concerns.

Growing quickly! Express is still developing career paths for FOC.
more flexibility in hours offered
Lack of availability of jobs I desired
The position itself can be difficult and not for everybody
More organization and better insurance for employees.
None at this time- very happy!
No cons to working here
candidates are goofy sometimes to say the least
base pay is not in line with job requirements
The jobs didn't always match what I wanted
Unless hired on permanently, assignments can end at anytime.
I cannot think of any cons working here
challenging for me to work
I did'nt get much hours from the company that I was assign for
You have to work quite awhile before getting paid holidays but this is comparable to other temp agencies.
I do not have any
Cliental can be difficult, conflict is daily High turnover rate due to being too stressful
They communicate well. Just would like a closer office to my contracts they assign.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Northside-Hospital-Reviews-E20642.htm,"Excellent company to work for. Just had my 10-year anniversary. Love my schedule, colleagues, and supervisors. All are very accommodating, and willing to work with you through just about anything, such as when personal issues/problems arise. I can't say enough! Northside Hospital is a great place to work, and I hope I finish my career here.
The northside I work at is amazing. I have a great management team and amazing coworkers that feel like family. Hospital like can be stressful but the people I work with make it all worth while
Lots of work to keep you busy, medical staff appreciates the in house interpreters. Felt very valued/needed. Worked with two different managers during my time there and the previous manager was more focused on personal relationships rather than overall operations, felt like there was no structure or rules to follow with so much personal drama being brought into work, when the new manager came in she inherited a mess. But the last few years before I left there was a drastic difference in the environment I felt like it was a much healthier environment to work in and much more structured. Lots of more acknowledgment from the management, management started collecting more feedback from the team about the day to day operations. Taking PTO started becoming much easier. Another pro was the manager/director would order food every month for the entire staff, and ordering cakes to celebrate everyones birthdays, felt very inclusive.
Potential monthly bonuses and that's it. Emphasis on ""potential"".
Our organization fosters a supportive culture and a welcoming environment for interpreters. Our department's schedule flexibility allows us to have a work-life balance. There are plenty of opportunities to improve your vocabulary in various medical fields, which is exceptionally beneficial for those looking to advance as language interpreters. Continuous learning initiatives provide ways for enhancing skills and knowledge. Medical staff are very appreciative of what we do and collaboration with other departments is a delightful experience. Management demonstrates exceptional inclusivity and an understanding of our diverse team, which has individuals with diverse personalities and approaches to task execution.
Everyone is very nice; very little micro managing; easy job to keep
Great place to work, plenty of space to develop and grow into other positions. Amazing doctors, NP's, AP's and other staff.
In general , employees there do what they can to survive there.
Being on call is not bad
Pay was reasonable for job title
Getting to know different people
Great place to work Could be better
Incentives, pay, compensation, bonuses, time off
Great benefits, lots of overtime available, great staff and support, pension.
Management is very flexible with work life balance
Great coworkers, decent pay for a new graduate
Retirement, advancement opportunities, and diversity.
The only pro is that the job is flexible .
Clear policies and protocols. Leadership very involved.
I have been employed with Northside for almost 8 years, and I will have to honestly say, it is one of the best hospitals I have worked for. I have been presented with opportunities to learn and grow from one position to the next. It is an awesome place to work for and I love my co-workers. Northside is definitely my home away from home.
Pension plan Free meals for providers
Getting to know different people
Great people, great place to be.
Great benefits. A lot of insurance options.

NSH provides opportunities and pathways for growth and professional development. Since our department went remote several years ago, our leadership team looks for ways to bring us together, which I really appreciate.
Great benefits, lots of overtime available, great staff and support, pension.
Management is very flexible with work life balance
Northside has amazing benefits with the only hospital to offer pension plan in GA. The culture really pushes you to cllaborate and become a better employee every day. There are opportunities at every level to choose from and training to be better at what you do. I transitioned from a bedside nurse to information system employee, and it has been absolutely rewarding that Northside gives you the opportunity to grow and be better at whatever talent you bring in.
Great coworkers, decent pay for a new graduate
- Interview made it sound like a great place to work. - Will receive quality care and above average patient services and satisfaction - Streamlined, integrated healthcare plan for patients

Great benefits, helpful staff and location is good
Coworkers, pension is great and PTO is good.
Cherokee is growing which is very exciting for The community and the care we can provide. CEO Billy walks around frequently, couldn’t even tell you who the CEO of St. Joesphs was.
Can't honestly think of any!
Overtime, fair pay, lots of opportunities
Once you’re vested it’s worth the five year time you work. Good work culture.
-The organization believes in growing their own -The organization has a lot of layers of support for whatever role you work in -The organization has so many different opportunities in so many different segments of healthcare -The organization has a strong senior leadership team which has provided the staff with financial security, protecting staff from layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts even through economic downturns -The organization understands that how people are treated is important for patient satisfaction and staff retention, making this an expectation and priority for all staff -The organization offers competitive salaries, educational reimbursement, professional development opportunities, great benefits, retirement savings and matching, and a pension
- Incredible Teammates - A lot of work to stay busy - Overall, hospital staff appreciates the interpretation team I had an amazing time primarily working at the Duluth Hospital & Gwinnett's ED/ICU Units during my time with Northside. The hospital staff was always kind to me, appreciative, & kindly called me for any language needs. The rapport was incredible! (My interpreter colleagues & hospital staff are truly the only reason why I gave Northside 2 stars & not 0 stars)
Help pay back college tuition.

It's a reliable job to have
Personally speaking, it is inspiring to work for a boss that you feel have characteristics from which you can learn. In the past, I have seen and observed great characteristics in leadership that I have, emulated. On the other, hand some that I would rather forget. They were more of a dictator who constantly gives orders. They never motivate, appreciate, delegate, or empower their subordinates. The ones that I enjoyed working for, were the ones that invest quality time and resources in their staff. What I admired most was their enthusiasm about the job quality; boss-to-employee relationship, building trust with employees, giving and receiving feedback communication. Displaying a coachable personality and humility is also an important trait. I found these helpful, and effective in my current leadership role here at Northside.
Average typical healthcare experience overall
Flex schedule great benefits work at home Great upward and lateral movements
paid decent easy help people out
They have Great benefits and job opportunity
- Great coworkers - Flexible Schedules
Great coworkers & resources. They have policies that are explained and easy to access. You never feel like you’re alone! Gave me a great foundation as a new nurse!
The northside research program is very structured and well respected.
Great work life balance and pay

Great benefits, culture, coworkers and overall great supportive environment.
Main focus is on patient care. Other sites (Canton-Cherokee, Cumming-Forsyth, Lawrenceville, and Duluth) also take pride in community involvement. Forsyth is the best of the 5. This is due to Lynn Jackson COO. The pride of NSH is their financial assistance program (every speciality and sub speciality, lab, radiology, pathology, inpatient and therapy are covered) and Cancer Treatment Funds. They will not let you go without treatment if you cannot afford care.
Health Benifits are ok, PTO is exilent
Babies are amazing to help.
Great place to work and great opportunities.
Pension for full and part time employees. Fertility benefits
Hours are good. Co workers are great and so is Management
Interview was easy, they are desperate to fill seats due to high turnover
There are lots of good people working here. The building is nice and new.
The Northside Atlanta campus provides a professional environment where employees can thrive. Since I've been working here I have been met with nothing more than quality care for patients and respect for staff.
coworkers are great. they make or break the experience
Great place to work all around
If you are a hard worker that performs, you will be noticed - and you can go far... There are many opportunities if you have passion, a good attitude and skill set to apply to your job. The benefits compound over time, the Pension is accumulating in the background... Plenty of things for you try and explore at NSH
Competitive pay, tuition reimbursement, growth opportunities
Great environment and work ethic! Nice coworkers!
I enjoy the staff I work with.
","More communication between management and staff.
12 hr shifts, working weekends and holidays
The pay rate when I first started was amazing compared to other hospitals but I left mainly because of how bad the pay rate became, every other hospital pays at least $7 more per hour compared to this hospital.
The business office is ran like a plantation. I worked MANDATORY overtime 95% of the time I was there including Saturdays and Sundays. No matter what department, if you work in the business office, you WILL be working mandatory OT. Your PTO request will be denied (even for doctor's appointments) because they are always understaffed due to people quitting. The Alt Right managers and directors have a superiority complex and they look down on the staff (depending on what you look like). They go out or their way to be disrespectful. The supervisors are flunkies who do the dirty work of upper mgmt. You will get finger pointing, petty emails and Skype messages. And your supervisor and team leads will nag you the whole day at the behest of management. My supervisor never stopped harassing me even though I always met production and goals. The job is remote but you will ALWAYS be threatened to have to come in the office for any so-called infraction. There is no work life balance what so ever. You WILL be doing the work of 2 or 3 people due to understaffing. You will always be on mandatory overtime including weekends. They will throw ""special projects"" on you with a crazy deadlines at any give moment. This will be on top of your regular work. For anyone that works there, make sure you get regular check ups because the stress will kill you slowly! The Coordinator and manager (and directors) are liars and bigots! Good riddance to that place.
Career advancements and promotional opportunities are limited.
Little room for growth; they care more about productivity than patient care (this is a systemic problem though in healthcare); they do not care about loyalty whatsoever; hire more new grads and just seem to want bodies more so than quality care for the patients
The pay is as little as possible no matter how much experience you have in the field you are applying for. Even if you have worked for a similar office and know the ins and outs of everything that needs to be done, they still try and low ball you.
As a former employee with direct knowledge of how things are ran in that office, i can say this.. The manager there is trying to do the best she can under the circumstances however, It is very obvious to all, the Director there is who is running the show. How can someone, anyone be able to be an effective manager there when she has a micromanager director breathing down her neck every second and is using her as HER escape goat to do her ""dirty"" job ? She (the director) goes to bad for the few people she likes and to bow to her while throwing trash and not caring for anyone she does not see worthy of her. One more thing. Pay there is a joke, There was a time when salary was competitive. Now, any other place for the job, pays much better. They stopped using their PRN staff a while back. They should have increased their full time staff the salary the prn's were making which is close to what a good interpreter is making these days.
Small department, only over 5days 8 hr shifts
Lack of communication amongst management.
Raises are not enough for the job.
Raises are low could be better
None really I enjoyed working here
Sometimes high Nurse to couplet ratios, large non English speaking patient population.
Job can be very stressful.
Non supportive and uncaring management
Care more about patient's experience than the employee. HR is hard to get in touch with. The health insurance is not the best.
The management at hospital is not ran well . There is no room for professional development growth . It is ran like a high school and a click no cohesiveness . They only promote within and if you are in a click with them . They do not have update software and are behind in time on different data bases that can help make thins run smooth .
Pay not as competitive as other hospitals.
I really don't have a con to post
Disorganized management Low pay You have to use Pto to be off major holidays
Raises are not enough for the job.
No cons to mention .
Current department is understaffed causing heavy workload. On the order hand when fully staffed workload is very manageable.
Raises are low could be better
Working from home is not always as great as some people might think. I miss seeing my coworkers.
Sometimes high Nurse to couplet ratios, large non English speaking patient population.
Job can be very stressful.
I do not see any downside working at Northside as long as you do your work, sky is the limit.
Non supportive and uncaring management
- Interview is deceiving and did not match with what was discussed. - Unit assigned to was extremely volatile and toxic, nurses who have been there for many years treated new nurses (even though I was already an extremely experienced nurse) like absolute garbage; isolated them and then targeted them with horrific passive aggressive behavior. - No one talked to you or helped you out (forget any tag-team teamwork) unless you were part of the ""click"" that was already there. - If you go to management with a problem, even all the way to the Chief Nursing Officer, they immediately make it sound and turn it around like it is your fault without looking into the situation first and then punish you by ""interrogating"" you with very accusatory language but never talk to any of the other nurses perpetrating the behavior on the floor. - Despite their ""interrogation"" there were absolutely zero findings of wrong-doing on my part, therefore they could not terminate me lawfully, so they continued with borderline ""hate"" acts until I resigned.
i have no cons - love it
Lower pay than other facilities
It is truly hit or miss with management. Very high school like with cliques and favoritism. Turnover is high.
You will definitely earn your pay, especially in L&D
Understaffed, Decent Pay, could be more
Salary, healthcare costs are expensive.
Turns their back to bully’s. Had to call HR after an ongoing problem with a department leadership member (basically the equivalent to a charge nurse). Was told I didn’t need to call back even when things got worse. Northside CLAIMS to be a no tolerance place to bullies, but all they will do is send these people to some classes and let the problem continue. After 4 years of employment I had heard rumors of how this was the MO but thought for some reason I was different and my claims would be taken seriously. I was truly shocked to not be backed up when I shared my workplace problems with Senior-most leadership, that I believed I had a good relationship with. It’s VERY apparent leadership doesn’t actually want to hear your concerns, they will just settle for the turnover. I was told instead, “Don’t say the word bully”. Which basically felt like more bullying to stay quiet. Honestly, I don’t understand how multiple people over years can complain about a single person (including a LGBTQ staff member regarding sexual partner preference) and a person can STILL be employed. Would rather be short staffed than give people the option of overtime. (Leadership doesn’t want their bonus’s effected).
By far thee worst place I've ever worked. The toxicity was at an all time high! In all my 30+ years of working I've never encountered a place as large in regards to employee's and departments; have the most unprofessional and extremely toxic places to work. And the most tocix and unprofessional that I've worked was the head of the organization, the HR department. I truly understand the saying about a company being as good as its leaders. Man oh man, the worst!
Nothing negative in my experience
Could pay more but over time you will be compensated.
-The organization is very large and can appear difficult to navigate ones career through
In my 7 years of experience as a hospital interpreter, this by far has to be the most disappointing experience I have ever had working for an interpreting team. In Summary: - Your voice means nothing within the department (This is due to personal experience. In a quarterly meeting I made a suggestion in front of everyone just to be told by the team supervisor, ""I don't think anyone would take you serious"", after offering to do rounds/in-services. So there's that) - Your hard work means nothing within the department. - Multiple resignations (3 in under a year) - Hostile work environment (I came to work dressed in business casual attire (**Khaki's, Shoes, Northside logo zip-up, comfortable non visible T-shirt under the zip-up** I was told to ""Unzip"" my pull over & asked to completely take it off in front of team members & I was sent home by supervisor for wearing a T-shirt under my Northside zip-up that was zipped up** This did not happen just once but two times. Once in front of the Lawrenceville team & another time in front of the Duluth Team. I was humiliated to say the least.) -No room to grow
They do not encourage or help with growth within the company,
None at the moment. Great place to work

Nothing negative in my experience
There are a few cons that I wish to discuss later
It's a team approach to decision making.
Loud unorganized not enough signage
Too many systems siloed departments
boring same stuff everyday competative
Lower pay to internal hires
- Low pay - Continuous lags in the system
The pay for the workload wasn’t the best. They are extremely busy in the womens center but I don’t regret my time there at all.
There was no room for professional growth provided to diligent and worthy staff.
Nothing wrong with this company
Longer hours (part of job), attendance policy,
They expect perfection from employees but refuse to pay them for it! They search the charts every day for every minute mistake then make their employees sign “education paperwork” on every silly oversight like we’re not humans that make errors sometimes, which makes us feel like failures and like we will never be good enough no matter how much we pour into the patients and the company, and yet nobody ever acknowledges when you do something good or the fact that you may have run 3 codes in the ER that day and then they give you a 25 cent annual raise!
Could pay more but over time you will be compensated.
-The organization is very large and can appear difficult to navigate ones career through
The pay for the amount of work they want is a little much.
None at the moment. Great place to work
Low ethics, ask unreasonable things of employees (change job location from original hire site to 23 miles away - same pay), expects you to travel site-to-site and won’t pay mileage, not truthful
I have no cons! I absolutely love this organization!
They are na*is about where you park( going so far as to hire an outside parking enforcement firm). They make you enter the building through a tunnel in the back. They don’t want the employees to be seen coming in or leaving. All the equipment stays broken in this facility. Raises are few and far between. The management is constantly nit picking instead of letting us do our jobs. They are constantly complaining and never giving kudos when we do a good job.
managment loses sight of what actuallyu matters and what doesn't
Very busy with high volume patient load.
Usually only get 2 to 3 % increase even with cost of living going up so high
The departments are very much motivated by cliques
Pay is not the best and to get a raise is hard.
They are one of the lowest paying hospitals in the area. They would rather have dangerous staffing than offer decent incentives for staff to help. They are willing to pay travelers $130/hr but only pay staff rns $30/hr. This is why all the experienced RNs are leaving to travel or going to nearby hospitals paying $15+ more per hour.
It's a team approach to decision making.
There was no room for professional growth provided to diligent and worthy staff.
I'd love an easier student loan repayment program, and it's sometimes SO busy and can get overwhelming - but it depends on what you recruit for...and it's hard to put the work down sometimes.

The one thing I wish would change is the way off days are handled. You’re forced to take your pto no matter why you’re off, it all comes from the same bank. I wish we had the option to take a day off and not be paid at all and not be forced to take pto. I take care of sick family and I use all my pto to help them and at the end of the year I don’t have anything left to take a vacation. If I get the flu and Covid in the same year I’m stuck owing for the off days I took. I just wish there was an option to not be paid so I can take a vacation when I need it and am burnt out.
Just like every place in health care the typical obstacles finding mental health support for patients.
The pay for the amount of work they want is a little much.
Leadership can be unkind to new employees.
The cafeteria food it’s that good.
Micromanagement standing at the door when giving shift report
Decrease 2 weeks of PTO to one week that you have to take before short term disability kicks in if you need time off for surgery.
Low ethics, ask unreasonable things of employees (change job location from original hire site to 23 miles away - same pay), expects you to travel site-to-site and won’t pay mileage, not truthful
They are na*is about where you park( going so far as to hire an outside parking enforcement firm). They make you enter the building through a tunnel in the back. They don’t want the employees to be seen coming in or leaving. All the equipment stays broken in this facility. Raises are few and far between. The management is constantly nit picking instead of letting us do our jobs. They are constantly complaining and never giving kudos when we do a good job.
The computer system I use for my daily assignments is a bit slow and could use some enhancement for high volume of workflow, but overall I am able to get my work done.
managment loses sight of what actuallyu matters and what doesn't
Usually only get 2 to 3 % increase even with cost of living going up so high
Sometimes things don't always happen as fast as you would like. Be patient! If you are performing, it will be noticed. Make your bosses life easier, and you will be rewarded in time.
The departments are very much motivated by cliques
Pay is not the best and to get a raise is hard.
They are one of the lowest paying hospitals in the area. They would rather have dangerous staffing than offer decent incentives for staff to help. They are willing to pay travelers $130/hr but only pay staff rns $30/hr. This is why all the experienced RNs are leaving to travel or going to nearby hospitals paying $15+ more per hour.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Chevron-Reviews-E13524.htm,"- Great total compensation package for HR employees. - Lots of career development opportunities. - For the most part, everyone was super intelligent and my co-workers were great.
Safety is a top priority here, and it's evident that the company goes above and beyond to ensure a secure work environment for its employees. This commitment to safety is truly appreciated and contributes to a sense of well-being while at work.
Pretty easy going job throughout the day.
Benefits and 401k match are incredible. 9/80 work schedule makes vacations more flexible. Base pay is competitive but not crazy high. The size of the company gets you a lot of freebees and discounts. The engineering groups are usually on top of their stuff and good to work with.
Interesting work with very smart colleagues, Many opportunities to travel and/or take expat assignments. Stellar benefits including 401k match of 8% + pension + RSUs. Better DEI than most companies due to international workforce.
It’s ok sometimes nothing to do
Good working environment in the company
Chevron is a great company to work for, the company invests in its people and if you deliver results your career growth is inevitable. Loved them so much that I would love to work for them again,
All is good but salary could have been higher for the level of responsibilities
Makes one more knowledgeable and interested in working.
Salary and good perks for direct hire
Aside from all the benefits, salary, bonus, 401k, pension, they focus on internal movement and promotion first before they hire externally. There are lots of opportunities to experience other departments and gain new skills.
Competitive salary, good benefits and work life balance. Vast majority of colleagues are highly competent and will drive you to work at a high standard.
Chance to work in diverse tech platform
I had a great experience with social environment and expertise.
I started with no experience or knowledge in Oil and Gas, and moved all the way to Corporate Business Development and Benchmarking! I learned an immense amount about the oil and gas industry

Great culture of safety, inclusivity and respect. Good compensation and flexible schedule. Highly competent colleagues. Management seems to care about the employees to the extent that business priorities can be maintained. Plenty of opportunities to move around the company and get a taste of different aspects of the whole enterprise. One of very few oil majors that still recognize values in research and development.

","- The vibes are (sometimes) off. - High internal stress at all levels of the HR organization and very competitive. - Not a lot of HRIS / technical-focused roles or mentoring available within the U.S. - As with any company, working in HR can sometimes feel 'clique-ish' because they don't hire much externally (although a lot of internal movement) and the same people have worked with one another forever. - Constant restructuring and 'transformations,' but such is the O&G life and most Fortune 500 companies.
Team dynamics are strained, with a tendency for colleagues to focus on errors without providing helpful guidance. This affects personal growth and development. Opportunities for advancement seem limited, which can lead to a feeling of stagnation and disappointment. Leadership occasionally displays favoritism, creating an uneven playing field and impacting overall morale.
Not much growth in the position.
Chevron is a massive company, so it's very easy to get lost amongst the thousands of employees. Communication of key employee information is not great at times, you need to find out a lot of stuff for yourself through word-of-mouth.
Most jobs are high workload and high stress, leading to poor health and zero work/life balance. 90% of managers are superb, but the other 10% make life hellish. Few opportunities to advance and layoffs occur every few years when oil prices tank. Base comp and cliff vesting for RSUs is not competitive.
But sometimes you do more than you should do the pay is not great
I didn’t see anything bad about the company in these 2 years
The oil and gas industry has had several ups and downs in the last 10 years as a result of that from time-to-time Chevron has had to let me people go.
Rental of apartment could have been longer than one year for those who relocated from field to HQ
It's kind of stressful at times.
Bureaucracy and management can be hard to deal with
- Oil & Gas company - Old school, let’s in the game with changes in software etc - Bad leadership in some
It is a large company, and doesn't always feel as if superiors have your best interests at heart. Important to take control of your own career progression.
Some times it get chaotic, lack of resources
There probably no disadvantages working at marketing department of chevron oil field.
visa issues and lack of support with portfolio optimization and decision quality. Some become supervisors because of pay grade, not because they would be a good supervisor. Many employees let go before the pay grade that gives 'golden handcuffs'.
No cons at all from my end
The oil and gas business is very cyclical.
Salary Flat organization Salary of tenured is not being reviewed
There must have been directives from CEO to upper and middle management to engage with employeees. However, it is clear from middle management rumblings this is strictly a performative exercise and this is being done on a purely superficial level. Rather than taking constructive feedbac, the managers will receive an ""exceeds expectations"" since they ""met"" with certain percentage of employees to exceed the hurdle rate. Semi-annual feedback surveys are given and actually made as part of manager PMP which conflicts with the ""voluntary"" nature of such surveys. When management gets good feedback, they consider they're doing a good job. In areas where they receive poor feedback, they lay blame on the employee for whatever reason (balance needs of several works, employee misinterpreted question, etc.)
rude customers and the pay wasnt enough to live on

It is a large company so it has its share of bureaucracy- but in most cases it’s needed. It can’t act like a start up so don’t look for employment there if that “on the edge, build it as you go” culture is what you are looking for.
rude customers and the pay wasnt enough to live on
A place where Nepotism, an incompetent management force, whose only goal is to promote by any means necessary Unaccountable for their actions or decisions the company as a whole
Internal politics is just too much to deal with for a professional young adult. They need to chill. I also had a coworker that worked over 50 hours a week and the company encouraged that even though they told him ""not to""

Frequent layoffs when oil prices drop.
It is hard to be promoted

Poor Managment, low pay scales, politics.
The commute to San Ramon.
Homeless Sudden schedule changes Night Shift
Rotating shift schedule, standbys, and forced OT.

Nothing to say about Cons.

The department does not encourage the creation of desk references for training new employees. Its either in the trainers head and you have to pry it out, or its the SALY method of reviewing workpapers and tax returns.
Company Politics and favoritism. Low Starting Salary
Silos, processes, slow career development, slow decisions, people
Bad environment, promoted mostly men, especially those with bad people skills. Not supportive of women in advancement or general day to day meetings.
There is no cons, in working at chevron
small town of Bakersfield is good for raising a family but some early career folks might feel limiting.
Budget too constricted Since the oil crisis of 2017 the company has been cutting jobs
High turn over Lack of staff No career ladder Unsafe nightly routines
you'll get stuck on your pay grade if you don't perform exceedingly
Nothing to add under this section
Zero training and yet your supposed to know everything about the role. Minimum wage with a huge workload. Passive aggressive managers talking to you like a child and no motivation.
Corporate machine small scope specialization
Only con is time is very limited
Unfavourable Policy No reward for individual commitment Stagnation
Massive company, changing directions is not easy
Management in IT in my experience is hit or miss. Some managers are very good at what they do-- other managers just got in the way and seemed as if they didn't know what they were doing.
Sometimes it took long time to get something done due to complexity and to align with all applicable policies/procedures.
Very demanding, not clear career progression
Workload Politics Promotions Feedbacks Appreciation
Limited opportunities available for promotion and move to different areas.
only 10 min break. manager says have to use restroom during break times!
Nothing (yet). Will update as needed

There are no real cons towards working at Chevron
Moving workload to foreign offices, lack of growth opportunities
lose 1 day traveling each hitch
- Repetitive - Aggressive customers - Long hours
there aren’t any cons i can think of
Discrimination towards women and POCs is rampant (constant lawsuits and hush money being paid out while management denies that problems exist) Non-competitive salary for CA standard of living Lack of diversity and embracing of different age groups of employees Limited advancement opportunities
Frequent overtime and weekends. Not a lot of faith in management
-lots of working hours -tied deadlines
Physical health decreases, pay increases are subpar compared to other nationwide refineries, fatigue -minimal days off due to lack of skilled knowledgeable employees in operations, Management's disregard for family/work life balance, lack of hiring in previous years from Management's short sightedness caused labor shortage, increased attrition rate from disgruntled employees, health benefits are much higher than need be due to Management's poor negotiations with medical companies, old equipment combined with Management's fix equipment until it fails, environmental discrepancies not publicly addressed until state or federal watchers find the issue, Management's willingness to forego safety issues in order to train new hires fast enough to bolster workforce leading to very inexperienced and lack of quality in training. Plus much more...

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Keller-Williams-Reviews-E114145.htm,"Culture and people. The team I worked with was awesome.
With over 10 years in the real estate industry, I can confidently say Keller Williams Realty is a top choice for both new and experienced agents. Their training programs cater to all experience levels, the culture promotes building businesses worth having and their systems help to increase your productivity. Plus, the professional network here is invaluable.
The training that they provide is wonderful! You are able to learn what it really takes to be successful in the Real Estate industry. You have access to coaches and management at the brokerage to help you with contract questions and all else.
They mean what they say God, Family, Business! They offer so many useful tools to get and keep your business running!
Would not recommend this line of work to anyone, takes a very specific person to excel in this industry. Many see the glamourous side of the business (they rarely see the behind the scenes parts until several years have passed in the industry).
As a company as a whole, they seem to really support their real estate agents. Many of the offices are well-run and have really nice people. Most of the real estate agents and a lot of the office staff I met were friendly and fun to work with. They have good options for their workers to make both direct and indirect income, such as through referrals.
I work for a team within KW and the biggest thing I've learned is that each team and agent you work with is very different and has their own way of doing things. I like my team, but not everyone would. Find the right fit for you. KW as a whole has a lot of great resources and free classes, which is nice if you're new to the business. You can also get your real estate license for free if you go through them, you don't even have to join.
The culture is the key

Great company & great training!
Flexibility Fair pay Annual bonus
","can't think of anything bad to say because I did enjoy my time with KW
While Keller Williams Realty offers many benefits, some agents are detoured from joining by the commission split which could be revised. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons to determine if KW is the right fit for your goals.
Some of the technology that was used when I was there was first rolling out so there were some glitches, but once that gets figured out, it will be wonderful!
The commission split until you cap is pretty steep.
Again - would not recommend this line of work to anyone. Do not do this job.
I felt like at my office specifically, I wasn't really well liked by the people directly in charge of me. It seemed like they never really wanted me there and just hired me out of a desperate need. I had originally applied for a real estate agent position, and they encouraged me to apply for the DFI role, only to make me feel kind of forced into leaving within a couple of months.
This KW office's leadership seems to have good intentions, but they could certainly do better. New agents are left with little to no guidance. Ever since Covid, the office seems to have lost its sense of community and culture that they're constantly preaching. There's more focus on getting new agents in the door than keeping and nurturing the ones they already have.
I don't have any cons
Have to be a self starter
Waking up everyday unemployed is tough
I have no cons for this company.
Not enough time in the day to get your business
Low pay and industry can be up and down
they have a franchise fee and not the best splits for new agents
Wish I could increase my commission split. Been working here for over two years but they make it hard to increase split.
Lack of available office space, some trainings cost money.
Felt like one size fits all, get a bunch of bodies through the door.
The hours an MCA worlds can be strenuous. The pay doesn’t match the hours worked.
Agents must manage all aspects of their business, from lead generation to administrative tasks. Keller Williams agents are often responsible for their own expenses, including marketing, advertising, and other business costs. This can be challenging for agents who prefer a brokerage that covers a more significant portion of these expenses.
It is only Commission base
there is sometimes heavy workload.
Have to be a self starter
Waking up everyday unemployed is tough
Limited upward mobility No benefits
I have no cons for this company.
Not enough time in the day to get your business
nothing that I can think of
The splits and fees are horrendous.
Might have a tendency to help friends-
Low pay and industry can be up and down
As a brand new agent the commission is a little low.
The fees can get a little expensive
My office was filled with self centered people that only liked or helped you if you were putting money in their pockets. Everyone wants you to exceed but not do better than them.
There's a reason 80+% of people don't succeed, perhaps KW can differentiate themselves from every other brokerage by giving more of a heads up on what is truly required to succeed in this industry.
No cons to speak of
High Desk Fee N/A N/A
*Plan on having a year reserve to pay bills, especially if you're moving from out of town and you don't know anyone! *No insurance
9-5 office job life. Only 10 days off a year
No cons up till now.
Each office is independently owned and the owners are a mixed bag but typically very egotistical
No cons, maybe no health care Benefit
Market Center needs new team leaders. The team leads are so out of touch when it comes to reality and the needs of their workers. They are rude and incredibly greedy. They harp on everybody about Keller Williams being a “family” but that sentiment only goes towards the agents that actually make them money. Any body else? They could care less.
Not many leadership opportunities within the market center
There are really only downsides if the people you work with/for at your particular office location are not ethical or even nice. I was encouraged to continually brainstorm/come up with new ideas but unfortunately I just ended up creating more work for myself while someone else took the credit. There was a power struggle between the Team Leader and the main shareholder that not only caused a lot of in-house tension, but it was always as if the right hand was not talking to the left. My work was continuously sabotaged by a jealous co-worker. Also, the Team Leader was good at motivating and recruiting but did not know how to run an office or treat her direct reports with respect.
None foe me so far
Office is too far from home. Parking is expensive everyday.
Consistency amongst agent to agent interactions.
I don’t have any cons
There are no real negatives to working here
there is sometimes heavy workload.
Get out what you put in, no hand holding unless your in a program
you will get rejected so you have to be willing to go get it
-Very high commission cap -Commission splits are hefty for new agents (50/50 first two deals) -Commission splits higher then other competitors
Slow market for new agents.
Work life balance, no base salary
Limited upward mobility No benefits
Truly nothing bad to say at all
- low starting salary - long hours
nothing that I can think of
All brokerages charge a fee
Not really have any cons.
The splits and fees are horrendous.
This is a commission only position
Might have a tendency to help friends-
Fees are not as cheap as other brokerages. You are paying for service and training at every level so if you intend to buy in, you better plan on using the tools provided including trainings at your brokerage, discounts on coaching, and transaction assistance. If you want to be a bit more independent, the price may not be worth it. Additionally, they increased the number of years you must work at the firm to see any profit share. A slight increase was necessary but they took a big leap. Real Estate is a career with high turnover and often a lot of moving around so it seemed as if KW went a little too far IMO
May have work overrun into personal time.
Office fees, percentage you give your broker
Most people on the team were nice but was uncomfortable around a few team members
Quick turnover with admin staff
~Everything is about the agent, leadership sides with agents over employees even if the agent is in the wrong ~ The company value :” God, Family, then Business” only applies to the agents. ~Basically be a realtor and get treated with respect vs an employee
I don’t have any cons
Can be difficult to get broker help/support at times.
There are no real negatives to working here
mean people here and there
Get out what you put in, no hand holding unless your in a program
I have none. It’s great.
Not the best place to start as a new agent. Not enough support.
you will get rejected so you have to be willing to go get it
-Very high commission cap -Commission splits are hefty for new agents (50/50 first two deals) -Commission splits higher then other competitors
Slow market for new agents.
They push you to become a licensed real estate agent and if thats not what you are interested in the environment drastically changes.
Work life balance, no base salary
The pay was terrible, expectations too high for the pay.
Truly nothing bad to say at all
- low starting salary - long hours
Too much fluctuation in pay based on market
All brokerages charge a fee
Not really have any cons.
I felt underpaid most of the time I was there
This is a commission only position
Your are running your own company and wear 30 hats at once. If you have no clients, you make no money.
You have to work hard to get paid like any other job.
Commission only The “agent” industry as a whole isn’t great
Lack of communication & high stress
Have to pay monthly office dues and annual real estate fees to the association.
They always try to do better for their agents. No complaints from me.
You must be a student.
If you dont want to run your own business or work alone, join a team for training and support to get started.
Lots of fees, but worth it if your office trains well
Lack of clarity and communication in role changes, unclear expectations of roles.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brookdale-Senior-Living-Reviews-E6433.htm,"The benefits are amazing! We have the benefits of a large company but we still have a small town feel, like family. Associates are appreciated.
They take care of their employees and provide the best senior care available anywhere.
My coworkers were cool. The did pretty ok at keeping us staffed. It was better than other assisted livings or SNFs with 1 person per 8-14 people usually.
Hours Pay Advancement opportunities Management outlook Free food
Excellent training, resources and best practices create an environment that sets high standards.
I would have never thought Id again be truly happy in working within Senior facilities. Especially post covid, and having been in travel nursing contracts just to avoid seeing so many deplorable places. This is by far Hands Down- THE BEST Senior Care Facility Ive ever worked in. Im honored wearing my Brookdale shirt! Its so clean and organized and systematically run so well from Top Management to my Co Workers. Professional and compassionate care is constantly being given from every level here. Everyone pitches in! My shifts are now a joy to work. Its steady and very busy most days- but the difference is in the faces of those who work or live here , the smiles, the effort put fourth in the Teamwork- and HAPPY CONTENT SENIORS that is the best indicator.
The overall culture is amazing, strong benefit package, flexibility in schedules, plenty of opportunity for growth.
Brookdale Franklin is a great place to work!! Wonderful Residents to spend time with. I have learned so much from them. What better job to have than to come to work and hang out with wonderful, bright - always wanting to learn and do more - ""friends"" The staff here is friendly and easy to work with too - an added plus.
During my short tenur with this company, the leadership and Regional Team were excellent supporters of the different divisons and community locations within their company. They acknowledged excellent performance and invested in thier employees.
I love working with my residents. I love the support I receive from my manager. I love the autonomy I have to plan my own schedule and goto what community I most needed in.

Upkeep of facilities is generally great One building looks nice
The residents are wonderful. Every day I came in for work, I was thrilled to see them and enhance their day.
Good enviroment to work in. Good hours .
Residents nice , location is nice. Clean.
I was promoted quickly, coworkers were nice
Great benefits. Loved it till new HWD came in. Loved working with the residents and their families.
The shifts aren't long and you get to know a lot of the residents.
Brookdale offers one of the most comprehensive training programs for sales managers, counselors, and directors. Excellent for sales reps new to the senior living industry.
My coworkers are my pros
Good learning experiences and opportunities if you are driven and serious
Not as many patients to a ticket as skilled but the management sets it off to be the worst workplace in years I've been to. They are out of supplies, food for residents, and schedule is awful. Management turns the cnas against each other with their lies. It's a place where you have to watch your back because you have no support and everyone is out to get you. Drama filled building.
It was nice staffing and good food
Brookdale is a highly organized corporation
A wonderful mission to care for seniors and their families. Proper alignment of incentives across the organization. Little tolerance for dead weight.
I have thoroughly enjoyed working for Brookdale for the last 20 years. There is never a dull day in this career. I have had the most supportive management staff anyone could ask for. Helping take care of our resident's financial needs while our community staff takes care of their personal and medical needs is extremely rewarding. It's like taking care of my parents and grandparents. What a way to give back!

Bonuses, nice co workers when they stay.
Friendly coworkers & management. Lunch meal provided daily
Nice hours, 7-3, pay is okay, nice amount of breaks
Caring and compassionate leaders Cornerstones are engrained in the day-to-day, not just talking points Infinite resources Opportunity for advancement
Flexible schedule Good benefits package
Great print PR in all forms of advertising. Facilities are attractive.
The residents were friendly and appreciative of me.
I love being in a support role for all of the awesome caregivers, med techs, housekeepers, kitchen people, activity assistants, and managers, as well as for the families of our lovely residents, and of course the residents themselves. I am truly grateful to be here.
Love how everyone here is so dedicated to our residents and that they love their job. And many of the employees have been either in this business or here at the Community for many years... And there is a vast amount of career advancement with this organization.
Building trust with our residents and families has been the most fundamental aspect of my Brookdale life, My residents know that I am here for them for anything I can do to help them in their everyday, from resetting a clock, to tying a shoe, giving a hug, or explaining what is reflected on their invoices. Being in my position, as they transition from one way of living to our Community is sometimes very hard on them, I must assure them that I will be available for them, and I will advocate for them if they see any problems on their invoices. One of my residents calls me her Financial Earth Angel, ha ha ha, she pays once a year, mid-year, and without the help of Jacob Holt, and Mary Zak-Kowalczyk that annual contract would be a nightmare.

Kind residents Kinds staff Flexible Hours
I've enjoyed every minute working here. Not only are the residents amazing and so appreciative of everything I do for them, but our Executive Director is the best. I love the flexible work schedule and all the benefits. I've recruited two friends to come work here, and several others to volunteer. Come join me and see how great Brookdale is.
It was nice staffing and good food
This is one of the better facilities to work at in the area in terms of environment. It's pleasant and a lot less stressful than some other facilities. Management tries to acknowledge good work done.
Nice perks, great training, good pay
you work alone at the front desk, and you have free time a lit
Great team and atmosphere to work in
I thoroughly enjoy working at Brookdale MVP. Positive attitudes, team players, wonderful residents, but just as important, management's appreciation and support for special interests. I moderate a 'Deeper Discussion' and 'Poetry/Prose' session on alternate Wednesdays for an hour...I love it...residents love it.

I enjoyed working with my residents. I enjoyed the opportunity for growth and advancement. If you’re interested in healthcare, this is a great place and job to learn a lot about how it works.
Average and/or good pay for industry.
Corporate support, good benefits, and company credit card. Plenty of training.
The only thing this company has been successful in is treating their employees like trash.
They love money and making them feel loved

The people, staff, residents, families and friends are all great!
I have been lucky to be part of the Leadership Team. I have a different experience working in Brookdale - some of which care staff would attest to. I like that I am continuously growing and greatly appreciated here.

Making a difference in our senior's life. And working with a wonderful and caring bunch of people.

seeing our senior citizens happy
great pay, hours, and benefits
If you have no work ethics and call off all the time great place for you
friendly staff flexible schedule great atmosphere safe and clean environment room for growth
The residents was so kind
A pleasure to serve the elderly.
Great people to work with Great benefits Great environment to work in
Flexibility, commission structure is excellent, time off is generous
Management was on the ball, collaborative environment to reach common goal.
The pay was amazing great job
Management is open to ideas and suggestions. The nurses and med aides are also great they have no problem getting on the floor and assisting with care if needed. Staff members work as a team. The kitchen staff are well organized and get meals out the window to table in no time at all. Kitchen staff will also make plates for staff. Which saves time plus money on lunch breaks. Calm environment .
Brookdale is a place where people genuinely care for one another, and they are driven by a higher sense of purpose. There's a lot of opportunities to grow your career within the communities or at corporate. You can tell leadership truly cares about the people.
Genuine people you're working with.
Helping your clients is a feel good experience. Lucrative. Opportunities to have bonuses on top of base and commission if goals are met.
I have been with the community for almost 11 years. I believe in accountability but also being respectful. I also believe a communities backbone is not in its management but the associates entrusted to our care. The residents care, family and associate satisfaction equals the success of the community. I am proud of each of the associates who have chosen Brookdale Harrisonburg as their home and enjoy working with you, laughing with you and caring about our residents with you everyday. Thank you each for all you do! You are amazing!!
great job if you enjoy helping others
What they tell you they do it! Their training is exceptional! Commission and bonus package are attainable and generous. Employees do stay because of the work training and positive atmosphere.

Great people to work with Great benefits Great environment to work in
They will hire you without prior experience or certification. You'll never be short on hours.
Weekly pay Good health insurance
","I honestly can't think of anything bad to say.
Lots of exposure to people passing away.
Every once in a while you would be left for a few hours without help until they got scheduling figured out. Management was good up until right when I quit. When I was hired I asked them about my nose ring (standard small hoop. Skin colored) and they said it would be no issue. Then months later they had us start covering tattoos and piercings with bandaids??? I was already going back to school so I phased out.
Losing residents you've made a relationship with (Huge con) Seeing residents families not give their loved ones the respect and love they deserve.
Not everyone shares the desire to give 110%, or even show up in this industry these days and management slow to address, like so many HR depts these days. Unfortunately, it discourages those who ARE giving it their all.
Youll gain a few pounds! The deserts are Fabulous!
The PTO time could be better, but the culture and flexibility makes up for it.
Working so close everyday to these wonderful residents - they become your friends... and when life comes to an end -- you feel bless they were part of your life but it's still hard.
Sometimes the front line staff is overlooked.
Sometimes the support in the communities is poor. Lack of private work space to work in some communities. Paper charts and EMR systems make it difficult to see lab results ect. on resident in a community other than the one your working in.

Minimal training HR will scream at you Supervisors unavailable Two separate buildings Not enough staff Training is on a computer for 2 days Doesn't explain unsafe environments
Management is a mostly unpleasant mixed bag. Most managers I worked under were either too inexperienced and prideful to admit their incompetence, or just ignored feedback due to their tenure within the industry.
no cons for this company
Management is poor. Doesn’t help.
Pay is poor for the hardest job, people training me didn't know the answer to questions that could result in life or death
New HWD shows favoritism. Let’s some staff get away with murder that should of been terminated and picks on good staff. Horrible communication skills. Not a team player.
The pay was little when I worked here, and a lot of the times we were very short staffed
Can be overwhelming with wave after wave of new steps to implement without ending others to better focus on new information and strategies. Redundancy in many reporting steps. ""Busy work"" steps that do not improve numbers or increase efficiency.
When I have to cut hrs due money
Profit before care concerns or safety or staff
Pay isn't close to equal. You're told you'll do assisted living and not skilled labor and it's not true.
No enough employees to help
long hours, tough community, hard to find the right people for healthcare
Negative business environment post-covid creates financial stresses.
It's sad that Brookdale stopped the milestone rewards program. The recognition was very special along with the swag. :)
It's sad that Brookdale stopped the milestone rewards program. The recognition was very special along with the swag. :)
They only care about the residents, not staff. People are combative.
Low pay. Hours available to work fluctuated, at times drastically low or high, causing staffing issues
Not a great company to work for. Benefits are okay. Overwork employees
Lots of systems, which can be very overwhelming at first, but in the end are very helpful
High turnover in management and building executives
The senior communities should be all about taking excellent care of residents, day and night. The reason this does not happen is that there are never enough employees to accomplish basics, let alone greatness. This is most problematic in nursing-related positions and staff in the dining room.
They do not follow the Dept of Health guidelines for PPE when used previously on a positive Covid resident. Failure to provide proper equipment. The DON does not put away excess morphine syringes and the nurses have to count multiple syringes. She could easily lock up the excess that are not in use. They should have vital sign equipment in Covid positive resident rooms but I found not even one cart in a resident room for BP, temperate or pulse ox.
I'm sorry, but I don't think corporate management has a clue what these awesome employees are worth; especially those in an Alzheimer and Dementia Living facility.
I don't have any to share presently.
In the last year, as of July 6th, getting access to crucial applications has been ridiculously difficult, because of my job title. I presently work 3 buildings IL, AL, MC. It took until approximately a month ago to get access to PSS, and Alaya Care. The crux of the problem is the reflection of the charges reflect on the invoices, and I had no way to justify what the charges entail. To this date, I still cannot print of Brookdale at Home Statements from Alaya Care. I have asked our BAH Manager to get me these itemizations, but she is generally not in her office either servicing customers or training new hires. I just want to print the invoices when residents want to remember what services they received or need them to file with their LTC insurances.
Profit before care concerns or safety or staff

Minimum Pay Lots of staff turnover
I can't think of anything negative!
No enough employees to help
Pay isn't great for CNAs, they say ""no pressure"" to pick up shifts but they will pressure you, their time off policy is terrible... you cannot request unpaid days off and PTO accrual is abysmal.
Not many cons to talk about nice work place
phones can get really busy
I do not have any to list at this time
None come to my mind

Certain members of management were discriminatory and offensive to employees. Paid employees varying amounts, played favorites. Definitely poorly run and not as clean as it should be.
Seems that every department is micromanaged and most managers are unmotivated because of it
Low pay company wide. Especially for caregivers.
From the moment I started working here my boss has constantly micromanaged me. None of my work goes recognized and I feel like I am be exploited rather than being an asset to the team. I was interrogated when I called in sick, and will get called into the office if I show up to work just a few minutes late. I can't even leave my desk without feeling like my boss is watching my every move. The best advice I can give to you is to STAY AWAY! The corporate culture here is horrible and the employees are not treated like people. If you want to enjoy your life, don't apply for a job here, go somewhere else.
They chose favorites. Talking behind their backs
Minimum Pay Lots of staff turnover
I can't think of anything negative!
too much work loads, poor pay
It's sad to see them leave.
High turnover, short staff, caregivers feel they are not listened to
Nothing comes to mind. Enjoyed the experience.

I have nothing to complain about. When I ask for help, staff is willing to help
Not to their fault, need to hire more people as the communities are nearly full because of their outstanding service.
too much work loads, poor pay
Kitchen duty in memory care unit
Everything management is the worst don’t appreciate good staff and praise the ones who don’t do there job or show up. Wages are not fair hire in more than what they pay already staff.
for certain positions there is a long hiring process
Rude caregivers didn’t really care about the residents would be rude to them
Full time hours don't equate to 40 per week. They are less but does not hinder benefit coverage. Average hrs per pay period range from 70-75.
PTO is accumulated too slow. It's based on hours you work
Can’t work more then 40 hours a week
incredible growth made it hard to keep up with everything that was happening. Not a bad problem to have.
Managers weren’t great at all
The pay check method is my only con. They use Netspend so your pay goes to the card and if you opt for direct deposit to your personal bank account I'm told it could take a few paychecks before that happens. I do wish their was more Activities on our daily calendar, would like to see more of it.
Nothing- I have had a positive experience at Brookdale and been able to grow my career and partner with wonderful people.
Awful culture, extremely low pay, no senior leadership direction.
At the end of the day it's sales so the good feels great and the not so good feels bad. Work life balance can be tricky.
When a resident passes or has to move from the community.
horrible management and not understanding proper care
Not to their fault, need to hire more people as the communities are nearly full because of their outstanding service.
Bad management, increased employee retention rates.
Management does not care about staff.
The Connection Center is a toxic environment led by people who have no leadership or humanity. They like to threaten the advisors to ""motivate"" them. They want to control things, have no sense of discretion and tell their teams they should be grateful that they make what they do and they are overpaid for their role (they are not by any means). They lie and tell the advisors that if everyone made bonus they could afford to pay them and they budget for it. They don't. They tell them, ""Honestly this job is easy. If you can't do this, you can't do anything."" If you are okay with groveling and playing a 50's Stepford wife role, then you will succeed.
for certain positions there is a long hiring process
Understaffed continuously so extra work for all
Full time hours don't equate to 40 per week. They are less but does not hinder benefit coverage. Average hrs per pay period range from 70-75.
PTO is accumulated too slow. It's based on hours you work
You won't get that certification they promised to train you for. You will always be understaffed. They're going to offer bonuses to cover short notice absences. Don't expect to get those bonuses.
Mandated almost daily to cover call-ins and no shows, lack of support from upper management, pay lower than other LTCs in the area

Right out of college, I had an opportunity with the New York Life. Being young I felt that I was at a disadvantage but I worked hard, I was relentless, and ambitious. My first full year, I was able to make a six-figure income. It wasn't easy but is medical school easy? Is law school easy? The training and development at New York Life was unmatched. I knew nothing about the Insurance and Financial Services industry until I was given an opportunity at New York Life and the training was exceptional and has led me to the success I have today.

Learned great sales experience. Training on business development and client management was top notch

You have to work hard, be relentless, entrepreneurial, invest a lot of time and effort into the business and above all, expect a higher standard of living and strive towards that goal every single day.
- First 2 years are the toughest, the lack or knowledge in a ever changing industry makes it a challenge if you aren’t committed. - No schedule, so if you aren’t used to having your own business or if have only worked a 9-5 and have been told always what to do it will be hard to find your way. - Drive and communication skills are needed, if you aren’t ready to create relationships and build a networking system it will be hard to succeed. - performance based career, be aware that this isn’t an hourly wage job. You will fail if you are looking to sit around and wait for things to happen. You have to work hard to make opportunities.
I worked a lot of overtime.
Not a 40 hour week
Mostly commission based pay- a lot of turnover
100% commission. You need to HUSTLE for your money. You might get commission kickbacks, as your pay is tied to people following their entire sales funnel. If you do not have a lot of individuals in your network, you will struggle.
- Commission based compensation structure, which may be stressful for some.
need to be good at time management
Typical of a very large firm, there are many layers of approval and things move slowly.
I worked a lot of overtime.
For me it was the work your own pipeline. I don't have one and my partner (manager) didn't believe me by the time it became apparent that I was telling the truth my time there was up. You have six months to write or you are walked. If you know a lot of people you can do well, if not don't bother. I only gave 3 stars instead of 5 because of my experience. I'm very disappointed that I wasn't taken at my word.
Not a 40 hour week
Training is 99% online and theirs basically no help in the office. They will tell you they have the best training in the industry and you have unlimited resources but that is just a lie unfortunately. They will also tell you employee retention is 88% but in reality its only 88% if you make it through your first five years. Its 26% for year one (but its actually way lower for Charleston) and its only like 30% to make it to year 3. This office is a revolving door of agents. They will also lie about their being a base training salary. The only way you get the base salary is if you do a maximum amount of production in a month. Just know they will promise you the world and you are gonna find out quickly that they took advantage of you I've seen it happen to a lot of people.
Mostly commission based pay- a lot of turnover
Too high target to get and toxic working environment.
- Commission based compensation structure, which may be stressful for some.
need to be good at time management
Technically behind Office politics Fierce penalty of failing exams
The Managers are incentivized to bring in new agents because they make a lifetime percentage on the people that they recruit. The part-time process is stressful and you don’t get paid. They expect you to give them a list of 200 people that you know; whether it’s family or friends. You have to give them a list of those people and their names and numbers. They basically get a 200 name list from new recruits while not paying them and expecting them to make a sale within the first 3 months. The role I applied for was advertised as a finical planner position, but the only thing that I was incentivized to sell was life insurance. I would recommend this job to older people that know a lot of people who need financial help. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone who is younger and trying to get into financial advisement. They also require new recruits to make sales while they are considered not employed by the company, so when they inevitably “quit” it does not affect the employee turnover.
Disorganized. Always changing processes but never following through to completion before moving on. Employees are now longer valued but stretched too thin without proper compensation.
Typical of a very large firm, there are many layers of approval and things move slowly.
Commission only work, difficult to get off the ground
You will likely owe the company money due to reversed commissions. All cold leads and dependent on your networking ability. Requires substantial liquidity. Risks alienating family and friends. Expectations are to make 20 cold calls a day and make appointments. Most appointments do not follow through.
Company is not always competitive with their salaries.
slow adopters, and often stuck doing things because that is how they were always done
Old systems that are currently being revamped. So there are often multiple changes that occur throughout the year system wise.
So many… - IT management have led NYL into a technological ditch. Lots of very outdated systems, tech stack, ancient code - Overworked groups where key people leave and no backfilling of positions - Underpays compared to other companies although upper management always ensures they get the big bonuses - It’s common for people to work in IT to never see a promotion after decades of working here which leads many to leave. There is zero chance of promotion that will better your life…you’ll take on more responsibility but see negligible increases in pay - People who leave will be cheated out of bonuses by management. This is unconscionable. - Avoid this place
The job is very stressful
spend a lot of time in work
You do not get paid AT ALL until you hit a sales goal. You get told to sit in Zoom meetings for hours a day and study for FINRA exams, but you do not get paid for this. All payment is commission based and you are expected to do multiple things at once. You have to pay your own money for events and there will likely be other agents there to take the business you wanted to solicit.
1. Be careful of recruiters who try to tell you that you will be walking into a 70k-100k+ salary when you are only being recruited to be an agent, fast-track or not. It could take you a long time to be promoted to reach that salary and you won't be paid at all until you become a full-time agent (can be up to six months, if you don't meet the qualifications, you will be terminated). 2. You will pay out-of-pocket for many if not most expenses after initial resident licensing expenses are reimbursed. This includes non-resident licensing and appointing, using the NYL software and websites, using the office printers, having a secure drawer in the office, etc. Being an agent at NYL means that you are essentially running your own business using NYL products, so you must fund your own business. 3. Risk of termination and losing access to resources is a quarterly concern for those who are struggling or unable to meet their mandatory commission goals. 4. Absolute lack of financial security, especially before you obtain a solid clientele. You may not see a paycheck for multiple weeks, depending on how well you are doing and if your clients are getting approved. Sometimes, you may only see a paycheck for a few hundred dollars, if even. An honest contracting representative will recommend a candidate getting approved to work part-time elsewhere so you at least have a steady income, if concerns of income are brought up.
Double edged sword of being your own boss
Strong emphasis on proprietary products (as a captive agent) and highly numbers and sales driven.
Constantly having to enter in other work for productivity scores. Work life balance is hard if you have children.
I dont have anything bad to say
Every job has cons to accommodate the pros
Constant restructuring in senior leadership, poor communication, inconsistent leadership approach
Very slow moving organization with a lot of tenured staff who are not easily motivated to do more.
Below market salary and overall slow atmosphere
Incompetent leadership Excessive workloads Missing/incomplete/ineffective processes Subpar hardware, software, & systems Insufficient pay Outdated, ineffective training
For career progression, it's essential to have a strong network & individuals that can advocate for you.
Not much support when underperforming, hard to utilize management resources for clients
Technology disorganized and about 5 to 10 years behind public insurance companies which are generally 10 years behind most industries on tech.
Commission only and finding your own prospects. The role is more sales than anything finance. Other industries offer base pay and commission so why work here if you already have a sales background
It was unorganized with poor management in the Intake department
You only earn based on what you sell. Most wash out. You lose your renewal income if you leave.
Sometimes training can lack in areas
Low pay, can be difficult to get promoted
Position is a revolving door, you see so many people come and go in this role.
Work/Life Balance is hard to achieve.
Office culture was not great
Commission only, quota is high. Fast paced if not met with let agents go quickly.
Difficulty of growing the business through marketing.
Lack of support Inability to take clients with you
100% commission-based pay. It takes a couple years to build a steady revenue if you're good at it. If you can't get in front of someone to make your pitch, you don't know when money is coming in. It also can get in the way of relationships because you will end up calling/reaching out to every single person you've ever met to pitch to them.
Benefits continue to decline, more positions going overseas.
Upper management tends to micromanage, constantly change their expectations without giving notice,
It's hard to get started if you don't have a fairly significant cushion or family resources. It's a challenging career transition if your life isn't fully in order or you don't have a passion for sales. Your navigation must be aligned with a passion for sales and the art of the deal to succeed in this role. Be truly in tune with yourself and your motivations, and you can have an amazing experience.
My first job out of college and wish I had managed my expectations before I started, My first manager left within my first 2 months and my second manager got promoted 2 months after that. Lack of representation in the office.
The management, showed favoritism, not nice.
It is very hard getting started but with the drive it is possible. The beginning is all about surviving long enough to figure out the business
can be a little time consuming if you don't have great time management
Commission Only, long hours, must be self-motivated
obvious nepotism; doesn't pay as much as other firms; bad managers who benefit from nepotism are *impossible* to get rid of
I have yet to identify any.
Unorganized, not very good training, so many system issues, lots of phone calls
Overworked Underpaid No WFH flexibility Understaffed No training
this industry is really hard if you dont have a book of business
Poor retention rate, new faces in the office constantly.
It is a very big company with a lot of agents, making it overwhelming to get a grasp
compensation, Slow in adapting to industry changes
Compensation and raise transparency and education
Micro management Lack of structured training
Pay, career advancement. They really close off employees who are looking to advance up.
Need to adopt more Six Sigma Lean practices
- 100% commission. No base salary.
you have to make it happen and be pro-active askign for help
Takes a while to learn softwares.
None really. Only great opportunities for growth
It’s an uphill battle at first
no cons. a goo place to start a career
Pay structure, awkward conversations with those closest to you regarding their finances, do you really wanna pound the phones all day?
wish had more OT available
No base salary, if you don’t sale you don’t get paid even if you don’t know what you are doing at first.
Management, benefits, insurance, advancement, and expenses
The pay is very, very low in comparison to other companies. There is little to no room for development. Admins are always left out of major events. They talk about diversity and inclusion but the majority of the VPs and CEOs are White men.
Financial knowledge less important than sales ability
- they tell you “there is no such thing as a work-life-balance, only work-life-integration “ - you're expected to be available whenever and wherever they need you to be (yes, that can include major holidays like Christmas) - poor communication at all levels of the company
Basically calling everyone you know to sell them insurance..
There really isn't a salary.
Unorganized, not very good training, so many system issues, lots of phone calls
Overworked Underpaid No WFH flexibility Understaffed No training
Depending on the department, work environment can be stressful.
High productivity demands managers play favoratism
The first few years can feel like you’re under paid so that for the rest of your career you can feel over paid
I do not have anything bad to say.
this industry is really hard if you dont have a book of business
Poor retention rate, new faces in the office constantly.
Beginning is challenging, but gets better.

This company is bare-bones but good. This means they place you in good positions with good companies, but their infrastructure as of 2019 to support employees was very poor. I enjoyed my time with the company, but the cheapness in terms of how they treated employees versus other similar firms was noticeable. However, salaries were decent.

Nothing I can think of
Working for a CMMI Level 5 company, one would expect a highly effective, mature, and responsive work environment. Regrettably, my experience at Atos-Syntel (soon to be EVIDEN) fell far short of these expectations, by the way I worked here for 5 years. From the outset, I was taken aback by the pervasive air of bitterness that permeated the work environment. This sentiment, unfortunately, did not seem to be an anomaly but rather a product of systemic issues that permeated the organization. The daily grind was marred by a palpable sense of disillusionment and frustration, which was disheartening for those of us striving to maintain a positive and productive mindset. A glaring issue at the heart of this malaise was the favoritism and partiality apparent in the day-to-day operations. The lack of objectivity and meritocracy was not only demotivating but also detrimental to the overall productivity of the team. This, coupled with the management's blatant disregard for maintaining communication, contributed to a feeling of alienation and a sense of being undervalued. The lack of focus on employee development was another sticking point. In this day and age, continuous learning and growth are not just nice-to-haves, but essential for a company's survival and success. Yet, at Atos-Syntel(soon to be Eviden), opportunities for professional growth were disappointingly sparse, leaving employees feeling stagnant in their roles. Despite the company's commendable achievement of a CMMI Level 5 rating, the lived experience seemed more reminiscent of a Level 1 company. The discord between the company's supposed maturity level and its actual practices was stark. I believe this discrepancy stems from a lack of genuine commitment to the principles of continuous improvement and process optimization, which are the hallmarks of a true CMMI Level 5 company. In conclusion, working at Atos-Syntel(soon to be Eviden) was a disheartening experience, characterized by an unfavorable work environment, blatant favoritism, lack of communication, and negligible focus on employee growth. This review is not meant to vilify the organization, but rather to shed light on these issues in hopes that they can be addressed, for the benefit of current and future employees. A company's success is, after all, built on the strength and satisfaction of its workforce.
Salary hikes are very less
Hard to navigate on the corporate side and given titles make little sense. Many diverse technical training is available but are most always for the Indian Sub-Continent. Communication outside your immediate team is pretty much non-existent.
1. No help finding projects once your assignment is over. 2. HR will pester you, even threaten you to go back to your base country as soon as your onsite assignment is over 3. employees are ridiculously underpaid.
1. Very much underpaid for deputed employees 2. No support from HR team on any of the requests from the employees 3. Worst upper management team 4. Lot of politics on Promotion and Appraisal
Not good place for experienced, very limited facility comparing salary and carrier growth.
No room to develop or get promoted. Small raises if any.
No appraisal reviews and little or no salary increase. Best you'll get is a $1000 increase in a year, bonus is nothing
There are too many levels of management to clear at times.
not a lot of upward mobility not a lot of help learning the internal system
lack of good projects in the company

The HR department is not so great! If it is bad to be exact. Processing can be slow, do not expect things to go as smooth as expected in general. Salary is low already compared to the job description, and you will be assigned with extra work during your job enrollment.
No one except you cares for your growth Salary consideration as per market isn't that great
No bonus component. Matching 401k was absent.
No growth Sluggish mid management Talent distribution dept is virtual HR dept owned by project managers
No benefits and high deductible health insurance
Micromanagement by some managers, no review for managers, no hikes or promotions for long service employees. Freshers might have higher pay than seniors, laterals might get double package than existing ones even they both work on the same team/level.
No support or response from HR and other supporting functions for anything.
You might see slight downward graph in growth due to Atos Syntel Merger
Limited development projects in the company
Should hike pay based on experience
Less package, Less Projects, Hikes les
upskill on technology, do not see any other cons
No promotions, no salary raises. People leave the company to increase their compensation.

The management was terrible. Communication was nonexistent. I felt like I was pulling teeth, trying to get answers about new projects, etc.
No hikes No performance reviews No one on one with managers
Managed by racist Indian managers
None, everything in my experience was good.
Less pay, only few people get promoted .doesn’t value their employee , no loyalty program for old employees
No cons is coming in my mind
I did not see any
Nothing is clear with this company. Communication is all over the place. Far too many meetings (1/2 my week is filled with meetings). Management does not appear to really care what’s best for their employees. The only concern is what the customer wants - regardless if it’s even rational. Bi annual reviews seems like it would be great, but it’s not. The whole process is super convoluted and you have more unanswered questions rather than answers. There don’t seem to be any merit raises and their idea of a merit raise seems to rest solely on the opinion of management.
THIS EXPERIENCE IS OF A FRIEND WHO I HAVE KNOWS FOREVER. Syntel will hire you no matter what as long as they think they can put you on client side. They seem to have two major revenue streams - One from clients, and other from their employees when they exit the company. SYNTEL WILL NOT LET YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING THEM MONEY. They will mis represent you in front of the client or even the government and will do their best to get you an onshore deployment even if they have to lie through their teeth. Issues come when you want to leave the job. They will make your life living hell and will never let you go unless you pay them tonnes of money. If you are on onshore deployment and even if you have been working with them for 4-5 years, they will ask you to pay them thousands of dollars if you resign on shore and want to join some other company. Even after years of work you have done for them, they will just NOT LET YOU GO. Like I said before, if you want to make your life a LIVING HELL. JOIN THIS COMPANY TODAY and you will never sleep with comfort in your life.
There are lots of atos portal issue.
Less salary and less opportunity for onsite
None I can think of.
Then Offshore iteration rate is too high and they mostly hire & rely on the freshers.
Salary increases are often limited. Benefits ok though require fairly high employee contribution. 401K matching / profit sharing limited.

Business Development: There are a lot of smart, driven and wonderful people here at Amgen, and particularly in BD. There is a culture of collegiality that contributes to a team-first environment in many ways. Amgen has historically been risk-adverse in their deal making, but some would say that has led to more discipline and less downside exposure. Amgen: The Company generally has excellent senior leadership at the CEO-staff level.
Was at one point outstanding place to work.
Team centric, puts patients first, great diverse culture
Good work life balance WFH Good PTO
Fantastic company recommend to all.
Generally good teamwork and feeling that all employees are trying to perform their best, however there are a few bad apples. Employees used to care more about each other than they do now. Amgen's mission is sound.
Work life balance is consistent with industry
Good culture in most every team I’ve worked with. Good work/life balance
Benefits are great and inclusive.
Opportunities, education, benefits, mentoring and values
great work-life balance and family-friendly
Great manager and work life balance
This company cares for its employees and their career development.

","No budget old school strategy and thinking to meet Wall Street
- Negative leadership - No room to advance due to nepotism - Metrics > Patient-Focused - Micro Managing at its best - No opportunity to provide input - Toxic & negative leadership in ISS
- politics (company culture is focused on people pleasing) -if you are a person of color, don’t be fooled by their diversity. They recently partnered with Howard university for their fellowships and changed the recruiter assistant to a black person but this company does not support growth for black people. One can be in a position for 10 years before getting promoted while others are getting promoted left and right for no reason. - those in higher management micromanage instead of being a leader. -several layoffs
-Pay fell behind industry standards after staying for only a few years and it was very obvious; no promotion talks so I was effectively forced to leave eventually -Large company culture means everything is very corporate and there is very little in the way of immediate-team building that doesn't feel forced. Key Comparison: My new company does nice SMALL team dinners/events that are actually fun and each is fully funded and covered by the company to encourage teams to have a good time and bond naturally whereas at Amgen the most that ever happened was a forced happy hour that the company wasn't even willing to pay for. I do not *love* corporate events, but Amgen's were nonexistent or awkward whereas my new company's are fun, engaging and actually make me happy to attend -Growth opportunities in my department were strict and limited to internal compared to other, similar companies where external opportunities were encouraged and fully funded to promote staff growth
Slow career progression Slightly lower salaries compared to peers
Not many technology are used
Long hours for manufacturing; however, the positive work environment and great management negates any cons.
Dealing with insurance can make hitting goal difficult depending on demographic
Intense and less work life balance
- Salary a bit lower than other comparable companies - No fertility assistance (egg freezing)
As with any large company
the work load is high and the pay rate is low
Nothing critical or concerning to mention.
Change is inevitable, but managed well
Intense and less work life balance
Typical politics at times but challenges can be overcome with patience and persistence
Can be difficult to drive things forward / get decisions made
There is not WLB left
Very Political- If you don’t have an MBA from a top tier school and are in the “club” you will not climb. Poor culture Poor unsupportive leadership
salary is in middle in the industry

Blatant Racism against dark colored employees. Career growth exists for whites and asians (majorities groups who ensures non-existence of others). Disappearing minorities is considered act of god here (gods here means internal self entitled psychopaths). All colored folks are usually tagged with poor leadership skills, poor communication skills etc and eventually forced to resign because they have not learnt how to harass, demean and treat others as doormat by pure racist cum political tactics. Not sure why company waste so much money on diversity inclusion when their chosen ones do exact opposite.
Typical politics at times but challenges can be overcome with patience and persistence
Manufacturing shifts are horrible no work life balance. The bonus and stocks are extremely low compared to five years ago. To much work to comply in a 8 hour shift. We are treated like slaves. Work life balance does not exist.
Pay is average in industry
salary is in middle in the industry
Far from LA, not too many other pharma companies nearby
Compensation not in line with industry peers. Takes 2 years for first portion of LTI vesting. Nothing to keep you hear financially
Promotions are hard, only way to move up is through switching teams.
They check the boxes on DE&I with training and lip service. I looked around at my department meeting. What did I see: Zero black employees. All people leaders are men. Having so many long timers makes teams clique-ish. Ideas and creativity are stifled by the attitude that this is how Amgen does it. There’s a haughtiness and condescension from some Amgen veterans when dealing with new employees. A common description from new employees I meet is there lacks an inclusiveness with new employees. Non-veterans bond over feeling like the “have nots” and how tough it is to fit in. There are so many systems that are overly complicated and often homegrown. The employees from the latest acquisition have asked for help and some are to the point of tears. I am not one of the long timers so I try to offer kudos to new people doing their best.

Laid off employees in maternity
There is no parking space for working
Growth / career advancement seems particularly difficult.
Investment in training and external opportunities for staff development
Too many layers of management
Lack of intensity and pressure, early in your career can feel like you could be learning more elsewhere. You are also paid less relative to other biopharma companies.
- Tyrannical vaccination mandate - Overbearing woke culture - ESG took centerstage and replaced the focus on innovation and even serving patients - Lots of zero value added meetings - Work life balance
Pay was not great for sales
As a contractor, you're treated differently from those with FTE. You're losing a lot in compensation compared to your peers who are full time, but apparently this is part of the ""process."" Contracting is your foot in the door but it can seem as if you're being taken advantage of since they don't convert employees over to full time until about 1.5-2 years. Even then, you have to truly be your own advocate in gaining FTE because the company will drag its feet as long as it can to keep you on contract.
Culture doesn't value diversity and inclusion
Biased executive leadership - harassment & retaliation - disability & minority discrimination - unpaid PTO Not everyone will experience this but in the 15+ years I directly experienced during my last 3 years with the company. Tried to resolve these matters diplomatically but it fell on deaf ears and I decided to leave
I was unfortunately laid off. BUT great severance package.
Can be a little too “corporate” sometimes and it can sometimes feel like the new initiatives and systems they implement are making the job harder/more time consuming instead of improving.
Slow career growth and low base salary

Slow career growth and low base salary
Amgen seems to big for it's own good. There is a lot of bureaucracy, and upper management does not seem in touch with those doing the hands on work. They also hire many contract workers without benefits. The work is pretty limited to a small portion of the process development. Ideal for those who have specialized.
Metrics focused currently and POA attainment
Certain functional areas and buildings can become ""dead ends"" for career progression.
I'm still new to the work, not much to criticize
poor management guidance and prioritization security of the work position is far from being guaranteed some IT areas are poorly managed, impacting other areas
None at the moment of typing
it is very busy sometimes
High workload which can sometimes impact work life balance.

I'd retire here if I have the chance
Pay and titles not competitive with Pharma/Biotech industry. Amgen significantly underpays compare to equal sized competitors, ~10-60%. Especially considering expensive Thousand Oaks/Ventura/LA area. There are been many people leaving the Medicinal Chemistry group for higher offers, and more on the way. The Medicinal Chemistry group is offers PhD-level graduates with no Post-Docs the Senior Associate Scientist title, which is crazy, especially with low starting salary. It's no wonder why so many empty hoods. Good candidates are going other places. Career advancement is slow, but they will talk of fast promotions during interview process. There is lot of talk about the best science in industry at Amgen but there only been one small molecule drug that make it to market in the HISTORY of Amgen. A common saying you will hear a lot is Amgen is research based because research is on bottom.
A lot of layoffs recently.
Everything from the Leadership, fake DEI, lack of hiring those with disabilities, to the overworked, underpaid lifestyle. They just heap more and more and more. Combining 3 jobs into 1 and pausing hiring is not sustainable. No real career development after COVID.
Navigating managed care issues, but I’m sure this is the case with other companies as well.
None that I can think of.
Large company, occassionaly politics comes to play on advancement.

Navigating managed care issues, but I’m sure this is the case with other companies as well.
This is not a knock on BD per se, but an issue the organization faces more generally. The pay is widely regarded as sub-par for the industry (ask most ex-Amgen employees if you want to confirm this), especially for the quality of employee and work that is done. The inflation adjustment for 2021 was less than half of inflation for top performers which seems to signal that management is ok with employee turnover. Also, the base pay adjustment between an average employee and a high performer won't be reflected in the base salary (although there is a high degree of spread in the bonus and stock grants).
Slow carrier advancement. Promotions handed out based on ""whom"" not ""what"" you know.
Resource constraints, heavy workload, high pressure
Salary below market average My manager was selfish, toxic and micromanaged everyone.
None that I can think of.
Amgen management does not show as much regard toward the employee as they used to. Working there feels so much more like a job than it used to.
Systems change n updates continuous improvement sometimes creates chaos
Pay is not very competitive
Bonus incentive snap shot dates are unfair to those joining Q1. Must be in Q4 to be eligible for most annual incentive offers.
I cannot find any at this time.
The senior leader team is conservative
Slow promotion and decision processing
no cons for the company
Non that I can think off

Loved getting my PhD here.
Understanding and helpful coworkers, interesting patient population, lots of variety

The residency program only wants the best for its residents. We get great benefits (PTO, medical, dental, and even life insurance)! The residency is very diverse, inclusive, and supportive of everyone, and the administration is very intentional about creating this environment so that everyone feels welcome. They're very open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. Preceptors and program administration also provide great feedback and are very understanding to the residents.

","Salary is less competitive but the funds are invested in my opinion in useful things rather than being handed out as extra cash.
huge lack of training and not a lot of ways to advance in a role unless you switch departments (even after making it clear to management end goal is x, no structure in the business to advance employees), ""thats not my job"" type of culture especially with tenured employees, lack of communication from leadership and management, little to no accuracy or presence of knowledge kept so many white men, very little diversity, even hard for white women to feel comfortable, for learning opportunities (the ones that are there are not updated), the minnesota retirement system doesn't vest until 5 years of total service and it's required and not possible to opt out of 6% of your paycheck - ends up being over $250 monthly, very far parking facilities close ones are $150 per month, hardworking employees get burnt out because of the lack of accountability
Low stipend because of student status
Not a lot of growth opportunities.
Lack of Communication. Procedures and Policies are not concrete and not very well informed to employees.
Semester crunch time you're left helpless and it effects the students.
The scheduling of the conferences across various rooms can cause some serious scrambling for teardown and setup. It's also a very complex building. Sometimes could be there til 10pm finishing setups for the next morning. It is a lot more physical work than you'd anticipate, sometimes moving like 50 tables and 200 chairs in under an hour, good for your health I suppose. The other downside you wouldn't anticipate is waiting in the break room up to 2 hours for the last event to finish so you can tear it down, good for homework though.
Under market salaries and limited room for advancement
As with any higher education institution, pay can only go so high.
low pay- due to public university
Salary and benefits are not yet comparable to similar roles. Education is a commodity and IT is in high demand. Higher Ed does need to ask itself if it's organized correctly to be able to meet students where they are, provide the right expertise for grant execution from a technical perspective and consider if investing in Athletics and Buildings are truly helping to attract new students.
Low stipend because of student status
Leadership needs to seriously look at pay. The benefits are great but for professionals with years of experience, the numbers are no longer adding up in this economy.

Lower pay than other places
Salaries have not kept up with inflation for research assistant
They don’t pay enough for the labor
There aren't really any cons
I work within a medical school department under the University that has some pretty awful culture issues (specifically classism and ableism) due to the Department Chair. Leadership actively does not value staff wellbeing, and many of the staff have reported being burnout with no resolution but to be given more work. The Department has surveyed staff last year, and found many issues, and didn’t do anything. They held a meeting, and left it at that. Some of the areas they lacked: effective work environment, equitable distribution of workload, conditions in my job allow me to be about as productive as I can be, leadership proactively identifies and eliminated barriers…. Overall, I’ve been within the university system for a large number of years and this has been the worst department to work for.
low pay, no health care benefits
It can be wild at night on the weekends having to deal with drunk residents
Need ability to expand team to keep up with demand.
-Challenging work hours -Minimum Wage -Having to do safety patrol
Odd hours and has potential for very fast paced requirements.

Beware of moving to minnesota because the winter is long and severely cold.
Not a lot of room for growth
I do not have any cons.
No cons at this time.
No retirement, still have to pay student fees, and no raises.
The UMN as a whole has been paying employees well below the private sector. In a time of severe inflation and rising living costs, salaries remain relatively unchanged.
More people need to hear about this residency so they can experience the welcoming and supportive environment at UMN COP!

The U of M is a bureaucratic institution with top-down, waterfall leadership structure. Performance expectations are high for most workers, even those with lower salaries.

Time demanding, location constraints, and rigid schedule
I have no complaints so far.
Wish I could have been scheduled more
no cons , just pay should be higher for the amount of work
- Depending on your professor you can have very different experiences
culture is old, can be gossipy, poor use of more modern office processes/software
I don't have any disadvantage about the job
Pay is low. Managers do not acknowledge talent
Was not the best opportunity for growth in that time.
Pay isn’t keeping up with public entities
The downsides to any research assistant position during a PhD is the pay
nothing, if you like research, this is a good place to go
Understaffed, low pay, bad management
Med school culture can be toxic.
Parking is ridiculously expensive School not always aligned with principles of social Justice that it espouses.
not that i can think of at this time
There are some strict rules for student workers
Low Pay and Stressful Environment
Not much ideological diversity. No residency unions.
- Potential to work as late as midnight - Managing fellow students can be difficult
Pay is much lesser than institutes of comparable repute
Career growth may be slow
With the pay system (merit based) you will lose money working here. Cost of living and annual raise are rolled together and at the mercy of the University President, never to be more than maybe 3%. With one year of inflation at over 7% alone, you will literally lose money, never get ahead, and never get a raise. Once you get into the upper management positions it's different—you get a bigger salary, more vacation, better everything, but the low positions ('civil service') are not worth it. I liked my position, I liked my work. But I work to support my life and make money, that's the whole point. If you're mission-driven, go work for the State of Minnesota. Better benefits, better pay (cost of living and raises are separate, and negotiated by the union). One year later I'm making over 10k more in a similar position at the state.
I'd rather not say, my brother's in politics...you understand.
the pay is not enough
Sometimes, the working environment isn't as great as the majority of the university - it really all depends on
There is none to report
pay is tied to grad student salaries
Communication problems within & between departments “Bureaucracy knows best” mentality among management Paying for parking
Time demanding, location constraints, and rigid schedule
Being a student, you're not offered much dignity, so it's hard to take care of things that matter in the real world outside of your education
I have no complaints so far.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Paycom-Reviews-E136736.htm,"Its a great company with a lot of driven people
Pay and benefits were good. Facilities used to be good but moved to a subpar location.
Paycom overall has a great culture. The benefits are good, and the team leads seem to care about you as a person. The job isn't necessarily hard if you want to learn but you have to be willing to ask questions. The product itself is outstanding and I think it is truly going to continue to change the industry for the better. The work life balance is honestly what you make it to be. Leadership goes above and beyond at trying to find ways to keep your workload down if possible. New client setup is a good career path. You get to learn a lot of the system and get to build great relationships with many other departments. This is an awesome place for someone with customer service experience and a drive to help, but can get a bit stale if you are the type who likes to stay busy. I strongly believe that Paycom listens and cares about their employees and clients.
There are so many great things about working for Paycom. If you are career driven, this is a great company for support in getting you to where you want to be in your career. The amount of resources and training is limitless. For the past year and a half, I have exponentially furthered my knowledge and I know there is so much more to learn. The leadership also wants to invest in their employees and help them meet their professional and personal goals. Your professional development at Paycom will coincide with your personal development with other relationships.
For the area, the pay was good starting out. The campus is nice.
- The Florida team is truly a family. In the year that I've worked here, they've welcomed me in and made me one of their own. They have a willingness to teach you all they know and help you become successful. - The Florida manager is one of the most caring and inspiring people I know. She wants to invest in me as a person and a professional and cares about me succeeding in every aspect of my life. She leads the team well and is innovative in the strategies she provides for us to find success. - Leadership opportunities and ways to make an impact on coworkers are readily available for those who want to progress. - The work you do with clients truly impacts their business's success and provides to the employees that serve them Overall, the people are great, you make a strong impact on many organizations, and you are rewarded heavily for the work you put in. I wouldn't trade working for this company for the world.
Very competitive base, if you get lucky you can make good money but you would be better served to work somewhere where you can build a solid income stream versus only making commission on net new deals one time
Super affordable health insurance that even covers mental health services. Some amazing people to work with at the company.
Going on two years here at Paycom and I could not be more grateful to be part of such an highly creative and fast-growing company that genuinely cares for their employees. Since the beginning of my Paycom career I have always felt supported by my leaders. Early on I had doors open for opportunity to grow and challenge myself for the better. Paycom has helped me grow in my career and professionalism, and my co-workers have become family. If you're willing to put in the work, I believe it will pay off!
Pay is good and benefits are good.
Culture inclusion within the company
- The Florida team is truly a family. In the year that I've worked here, they've welcomed me in and made me one of their own. They have a willingness to teach you all they know and help you become successful. - The Florida manager is one of the most caring and inspiring people I know. She wants to invest in me as a person and a professional and cares about me succeeding in every aspect of my life. She leads the team well and is innovative in the strategies she provides for us to find success. - Leadership opportunities and ways to make an impact on coworkers are readily available for those who want to progress. - The work you do with clients truly impacts their business's success and provides to the employees that serve them Overall, the people are great, you make a strong impact on many organizations, and you are rewarded heavily for the work you put in. I wouldn't trade working for this company for the world.
- The people you work with are driven, and motivated, and will get you through your time here. - Compensation is reasonable and on the high-end for individuals who do not have or have limited college degrees - Culture of work hard - relax hard (no one has the time to be going out on the weekends with this job lol)
Benefits, $4 meals, Unlimited found drinks. The 2 supervisors are great assets. They're an extension of the team leaders, and are very, very approachable. They're there to support and back us up, and it's one of the few things I find impressive out this job. Helpful team members, sometimes even in other departments.
There are plenty of good people that work at Paycom that truly do care about others and just want to do a good job. I really like my coworkers at my office.

I can't think of a single pro.
Health Insurance being $1 per pay period. Parking garages.
This job has it's fair share of challenges, but you get out of it what you put in. The training program is incredible and the office comradery is great. Work hard, play hard is the mindset of everyone. No one wants to see you fail. Managers will do everything they can to help you succeed.
Employee only benefits plan, stock options, bonuses/commissions if you hit KPIs
-Overall a great company -Employees are treated well -Good product to stand behind -Stock available for some departments -Flexibility to for time off to handle personal needs
Paycom has opened the doors to opportunities and knowledge I never knew that I would be exposed to- that I can see benefitting me now as well as in the long term. I have a collaborative team and a manager who pushes me to be the best version of myself but allows me the leeway to learn and grow on my own.
Work is okay, easy to learn and perform.
Cheap health insurance for singles On-site gym On-site meals that are payroll deducted Great coworkers
Commission opportunities are great for revenue driven persons
Good benefits, average pay, nothing else.
Base pay & benefits were very good. Coworkers were good, but always very stressed.
The Pro's to working at Paycom are the people and the benefits. They do well to recognize employees in regards to their anniversaries and some of the other activities can be fun and beneficial. The only other benefit would be the pay that you receive for the job you do. They do compensate you in some really great ways. Depending on the supervisor/team lead combo can also be great as well and are typically pretty supportive.
Compensation plans are great. Reps are incentivized to succeed and it pays off! Culture is a pillar of success. I feel like I can learn and grow my career here. Highly recommend.
The people. The culture is competitive but supportive, and everyone wants you to be successful. The benefits are amazing, compensation is extremely generous, and the opportunity for growth through career development or promotions is endless.
-$1 health insurance a pay period for individual coverage -The people on your team are the only reasons you can make it through a full work week
Learn new skills Growth potential Plenty of training in new or specialized areas New challenges regularly Great people
Benefits. Culture. Inclusion. Engagement. Accessibility.
Huge financial benefits for those who can adapt quickly and figure out how to sell it. Many people have made well over $250,000 annually in this office.
Great benefits and people as long as they are not above middle management.
Collaborate environment / full support from your team. Very in-depth trainings / continued trainings throughout career. Growth opportunities. Great pay & benefits. Sales is sales - it's a face paced environment. They are very upfront with expectations from day 1 so put your head down, hustle, build your pipeline, close!
Great coworkers Great lower management.
Working at Paycom is hard, but if you’re willing to work hard, there’s no better place in terms of the rewards you’ll get. The culture is competitive with leaderboards, the team is funny and encouraging and will help you. There’s lots of trainings (both optional and required) and your manager will help if you ask. This is a life changing opportunity if you treat it that way. If you want to play the game blame, this is not the place for you because you’ll be miserable with self pity. If you want to make money and welcome challenges, this is the place to be.
The people and the mission. I have made my best friends here for years now. We all want the best for each other, and want to be the best at what we do. Opinions are heard and anyone has the ability to rise and lead processes or people.
Great people, good atmosphere and good time
amazing benefits. fun things to do and high engagement
Really good place to work, and the team environment is pretty solid. The starting pay is decent. The work life balance is great all things considered. The culture of the company is diverse and inclusive, and there are all types of people here. If you are self motivated you will be a rising star. Managers take a vested interest in their employees well being if you let them. The PTO and benefits are great, and the PTO especially is more than you can reasonably use in a year. I truly believe they learn from past mistakes and want to do better and grow as a company. The senior management attitude and approachability is refreshing.
good benefits, catered lunch is nice
Paycom has truly changed my life. In 7 years I have risen through the ranks from an entry level TSR position, to management, to a regional manager, to senior leadership. I have promoted several other leaders on my path up the ladder and it is amazing how many ""Congratulations"" speeches I have had the honor to craft over the years. Because of my success at Paycom, I am building an incredible life for my family. My children will be afforded opportunities I only dreamed of growing up. Our goals of retiring abroad are real and attainable. Along the way I have learned so much personally and professionally and I have made life-long friendships. Every day I am challenged and pushed outside my comfort zone. I am surrounded by people who are smart, hard-working, and care about me and my success. I have autonomy and I am given the opportunity to lead huge strategic initiatives with big impacts. Paycom is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with unlimited growth potential. The culture here is the real deal. Paycom also invests so much in developing and training their employees and I love that I am always learning and growing. I am so excited about the future of Paycom and it is fulfilling to play a role in that.

I really enjoy working at Paycom. The company has continued to be successful each year, even during a very difficult market. Working for Paycom is exciting and challenging. The Transition Specialist Department is highly focused on personal and professional development. For example, I have been able to participate in Six Sigma certification and Clifton Strengths assessments.

Super competitive and driven environment
Paycom truly is one of the best companies out there. I feel honored every day to work with some of the brightest individuals in the nation. Our culture is unmatched and my peers have become some of my best friends. If you are looking for an opportunity for growth, both personally and professionally, this is it. Paycom is constantly innovating its product and processes on a monthly and even daily basis. I am thrilled to continue to work for a company that has a bright future and will continue to take over the payroll and HCM market!
Paycom offers a great place to grow a meaningful career. I moved to Paycom a little more than a year ago after spending six years in a job that didn't offer much opportunity for future growth. After a while I got to a point where I didn't feel challenged by my work and it began to not feel fulfilling. Paycom offered me the opportunity to move a fast-paced work environment where I feel like I'm challenged to improve daily. I feel supported by my leaders. I feel like I receive recognition when I succeed at something, but more importantly, I'm given the space to try new and innovative things, and the freedom to fail without feeling like it will cost me my job. The ability to grow through failure is something a lot of places won't afford its employees and it shouldn't be taken for granted. I couldn't be happier with my decision to join Paycom and I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds.
Paycom is an incredible company. The product is great, the team and compensation are even better. If you are lucky enough to work here you will be part of a team that is works hard and you will learn skills that will last you a lifetime
If you want to be a part of something special, come to Paycom. This is a growth company that will change your life professionally and financially. It’s an amazing company!
Great people, good atmosphere and good time
Great environment for developing professionally, they’re always focusing on making the experience better.
Great teamwork and leadership. Tons of opportunities for growth and promotion. A family like culture where everyone helps each other learn new processes and techniques.
I started my career at Paycom as a sales rep, moved into management, opened an office and now lead a Region for Paycom. The Paycom journey has not been easy. My first year at Paycom was one of the most challenging circumstances I have ever had in my life. Little did I know I was going through a tremendous learning and growth stage in my career that would propel me to advance every two years for the next decade. The challenge and growth didn't stop in my first year. Each role has brought with it adversity and challenge. I didn't see this in the beginning but I now understand these difficulties and challenges are what allowed me to compress time. What would have taken 10 or 15 years to accomplish in business can be accomplish took me 2 years. The success, financial freedom, wealth, security, giving, and the ability to provide for your family abundantly is all at Paycom. One of the foundational principles that Paycom taught me, that will forever stay with me is the ability to manage my head. Managing your mental state is not something that is taught in business, but it is taught here at Paycom. I love this dedication because it not only helps you in your career but it also helps you in your life as a Parent, Spouse, or Family Member. I am forever grateful for all the lessons and tools that Paycom has taught me.

Great motivating managers Great health care plan

1. Incredible teammates dedicated to a high level of performance. 2. Encouraged to push for new ideas and strategies within the department. 3. I get to work with some of my closest friends I have developed over the years on helping make a real impact. 4. Goal-driven environment. We are always talking about how our professional results impact our personal objectives. 5. Never boring. We are always evolving and changing. While that can put you in uncomfortable positions at times, that just means you are adjusting to new skills you are yet to develop. 6. Compensation is excellent. 7. You truly have a voice. Most companies you can make suggestions on strategy and it is either ignored or stolen. Here, I have seen for years, you can truly impact those around you as both an individual contributor and in management through your ideas and experience. 8. High-intensity culture where we are always pursuing nothing short of excellence. We have the autonomy to create our own cultures and win with our ideas and experiences in-line with greater company mission.
Good pay (amazing after my first promotion). Easy and stress free job (for me). Good outlet for a detail oriented person. Love the team I work with. Great benefits and on campus amenities. Can listen to music and have a cubicle to myself. Very lenient with time off and sick time. Can wear jeans and a plain T-shirt (or a Paycom branded one).
Nice way to gain office experience
Great company reviews, fairly stable industry, cool training
The pay, benefits, commission, not much more.
This position is not just sales, you will work with the client to set up their system. While it is challenging, and has a learning curve, Paycom provides resources to employees to ensure success. Paycom also has multiple teams to support the sales and implementation processes. Paycom has a fantastic training program for new sales reps to prepare them for both sales and implementation. Working with clients can be challenging and difficult, but the feeling of accomplishment, and the commission checks, are very nice for someone who came from a sales role with no incentive to perform better. The product is truly the best in the industry, and selling it will most definitely help a business with any HR or Payroll problems they are having. You will gain so much knowledge of the system, and how everything connects. I came from a role where I had no idea what payroll and HR should look like at a company. It did take maybe 6-8 months to feel completely comfortable in the role, but when everything started clicking I knew I made the right decision.
Benefits, Flex Time, Culture, PTO accruals. I love the Paycom app and how I am able to use it for myself and my employees. It is so easy! $1 per pay period medical, great 401k match and stock options. Leave time options are very nice. This job has made it where my family can live a comfortable life and I am very thankful for my job. The BAC department has worked very hard to create the culture that is has, people get along well and collaboration is at an all time high. If you show up and do good work you will make friends, and have a job you look forward to coming to work each day. I truly believe that the leaders of BAC truly care about myself and my team.
Great corporate culture. Lots of opportunities for growth. Good salary. Great benefits.

Great company to work for
You can make a lot of money.
I loved being able to meet with prospects, Paycom's technology was outstanding, and the overall job was competitive and fun.

Great product that's different from others.

They have a great comp structure
Stock is pretty good but that’s it
Potential that you can have
The commitment to development, compensation, and the exceptional quality of people you work with is second to none! Joining the Paycom team, I was hesitant in making the switch, probably like you. I was in a very comfortable role, as a sales rep for a top national retailer.I wrote the pros and cons of each and as salesperson I could really ‘sell’ myself on either option. However, what truly impressed me was the unwavering support and dedication from Paycom to help me succeed. The company recognizes that this role comes with its own set of challenges, and they provide ample resources, training, and guidance to ensure that their Sales Reps are set up for success.The training programs offered are comprehensive and designed to equip sales reps with the skills necessary to excel in their roles. From refining cold-calling techniques to mastering complex sales processes, Paycom's commitment to continuous improvement is evident. The company invests in its employees. One of the most remarkable aspects of my journey at Paycom has been the quality of people I had the pleasure of working with and now calling my friends. The company has a high quality filter of winners in all areas of life not just sales ability.
The benefits are good. Good work-life balance.
I've really enjoyed working here. I get treated like an adult - no micromanaging. It may not be the same for everyone else, but I've been treated well.
$1 health insurance, PTO, and courtyard.
Great leadership and great product
","Saas is hard and a lot of people give up
Started out as a great job but the last year has gone downhill. Management and HR are blind. I was pushed onto a team to “clean it up” and now can’t escape it. Length of device and exceptional work mean nothing. Less than ethical practices are rewarded and the ones that actually work are forced to do the work of those who don’t “for the team”. Never thought I would leave but am now searching for a new job. When I hit 5 years I was hounded to submit a good review. Really? Desperate? Treat people right and you would not have to do that. Isn’t the mass exodus telling you anything? You should know it is cheaper to keep the good ones instead of hiring and training new ones. Attempting to move to other departments is only for the friends of management. Quality of work is not considered but the ability to self promote is. Do you want capable people or sales people?
In the department, the advancement comes through mostly a title change with little change to actual compensation. After a certain point it is actually entirely just a number added to your title and nothing more. Ideas seem to come mostly top down, and not bottom up. We continue to lose our experienced specialists and leaders to better compensated departments and companies, even if the jobs themselves aren't really better, which hurts our resource pool. It also creates an uneasy feeling withing the department which tends to create a negative atmosphere.
At this time, I have not observed any downsides to working at Paycom.
The initial training was vague and confusing. Training & ongoing process documentation was unbelievably bad (typos, clarity, consistency, even locating). After training the trend of getting vague and confusing answers to questions about job duties and processes continued. No one really seemed to know what they were doing and couldn't help anyone else figure out how to do things either. There were so many meetings and so much repetitive busy work there was not enough time to do your job. The expectation to work for even 10 customers at a time on top of 25 hours of meetings & busy work in a 40-hour week was impossible. The focus was more on pushing the company's preferred culture and the latest buzzwords. You were expected to do the work of someone who had been there the same amount of time but pay increases were based on spending weeks completing additional training that you did not have time to do after the first 3 months. So after a year, I was making the same as someone in training but with the same workload of a Level 3.
The work is demanding in that you constantly have to adapt and learn new techniques and processes. Each client is different, each sales cycle is different, the Paycom system is constantly changing. It is a lot to keep up with, but my manager and team constantly provide ways they're making life easier. The focus of the company and our department can change rapidly, so being adaptable is a must. There will be new reports to fill out or objectives to hit, so understanding what is important and when to complete it by is crucial for survival.
There is not enough time in the day. Toxic wolf of wall street type of fear based sales organization. The running joke is ""yeah I'm getting fired"" for this or that. Miserable place to work, constant stress and pressure. If you're young and single it could be worth a shot but if you seriously depend on a job and you have a family to support and they want to see you and care about your well-being, literally look anywhere else.
Zero organization when it comes to projects, however it is hard for things to stay organized whenever you can hardly keep project managers hired. Even then they still do little to lead meetings. People are hardly ever on the same page because lots of communication is rarely put in writing. Everyone is burnt out from being overworked. When upper management wants something done they want it done ASAP but don't give teams enough time leading to faulty items being put out but then they still get mad at teams even though they didn't get enough time. There is almost no work life balance if you are put on a team that has a spotlight on it. There is a reason why most new hires are recent college grads, everyone else in the area knows better. Pay is also not great compared to other similar jobs. No hybrid options, zero flexibility, and you will get nickel and dimed for PTO for something as simple as a dentist appointment. You will also be micromanaged in pretty much every aspect of your job.
As this is a very fast-paced company it's important to be agile due changes that can happen daily and/or hourly. You will need to stretch yourself each day to keep up with the pace and professionals around you.
If you like working in a misogynistic work environment where female employees are to wear heels due to dress code this might be the place for you. Paycom tracks metrics, which is great but they are so focused on the metrics the results can be on the back burner. Their comp plan is generous but you can only stay to enjoy it if you buddy up and kiss you know what.
They do not listen to their employees. The pay is not enough for what is expected for the job. Gallup surveys are released to employees and if employees rate negatively, team leaders are then talked with that they are not doing their job when it’s actually supervisors and management specialist employees are frustrated with not team leaders but gallups are not allowing employees to express frustrations against the correct people that they are mad at. The Hub, where tax is currently working at is disgusting and not workable conditions. The food is making people sick, they have to work in loud noises and gross smells daily. This department is excluded from any headquarter events and is the department that is paid the lowest but they are why clients come to Paycom for which is to have their taxes filed for them.
The work is demanding in that you constantly have to adapt and learn new techniques and processes. Each client is different, each sales cycle is different, the Paycom system is constantly changing.

- Selling process rooted in blissful ignorance: Paycom will force the idea that the system ""saves and solves lives,"" but this is absolutely not the case. Management covered up 2 client scandals during my internship under 'closed doors' and 'hushed chats,' but of course the office gossip reached the ears of the interns as well. Clients are lied to on the phones and in meetings to try and get that big-fish deal, when in reality, the Paycom system cannot do everything the reps promise, and the responsibility then falls on the TSR's to convert the lie into an exaggeration. Although this practice is not all uncommon in sales, it is not combated and is quietly endorsed from rep-to-reo due to the aggressive management style. - Management style = this job is your life, if you complain, this job isn't for you. Rep let go in the startline class in my office (4 weeks in ) for joking that this job was ""blowing up her personal life."" Manager did not appreciate that quip. - Public shaming: Morning meetings consisting of sipping on coffee... waking up a bit with some office jokes... forget that. You are expected to show up ready to improv, combat accusations and embarrassingly demoralizing statements from managers, and be ready to have your statements picked apart and hurled back at you by Managers... all at 7:30a. Management style works for some, but this is all done in front of the entire sales team. - Lying, Lying, and more Lying. The PC board is fake -- Spoiler!! Reps are lying about 2 meetings on the board each (on average) out of the 6 meetings they have to set. So much pressure on Cold Calling and PC the business cases and presentations lack quality and proper content. I would lie too if I were to assume a sales rep position, the 6 meeting metric is really hammered down. - Motivation is Misleading: You can all make a million dollars! Run the numbers on a booked sales presentation and see how many reps are actually meeting their quota (another spoiler, it's 30-45%!). That's it for this review. I like sales, loved my office, and had a great learning experience, but this is an honest opinion of the culture here. If this sounds like something that motivates you, go ahead and apply! If any of this sound misaligned with your work habits, run.
I've been wanting to do this review, since I first started, so here we go. Raises - The only time you get a raise is when you level up, but it's based on revenue - something you don't control. So, someone who has been here for over a year can still be making the same pay as a new hire, because they haven't received enough revenue to move up, even though the specialist has far more experience. Tell me how that is fair?! Commissions - Only senior specialists get commission. Seniors get more complicated accounts, but we all follow the same process, but they're the only ones who get commission. Inheriting accounts - When advanced specialists leave the job, a level 1 or 2 can be expected to take on their accounts, that are far more complex than what they normally do. This adds more work to the less experienced specialist, on top of the workload they already have, and they don't credit on those deals, because they already went to the former specialist. Bonuses - Don't expect it. Instead, they give us Paycom merchandise, which is nice and all, but I can't use a Paycom jacket to pay my bills. Also, if the recruiter tells you about the free swag the company gives out, don't expect it in this department. We don't get anything. Training - A big joke. They don't fully prepare you to do the basics of the job, so you have to lean heavily on your team, to help you, or find ways to figure things out on your own. A lot of experienced specialists have left, and some who have stuck around don't seem to know a whole lot. The senior level specialists are supposed help guide the non-seniors, but sometimes don't know how to help, or are not willing. This is not always the case, but it does happen, and makes the job more frustrating. Also, there are times when team leaders aren't helpful, either, or misguide you. Add that tick mark to the list of frustrations. New manager - They brought in a new manager to over-see the department, earlier in the year, but she hasn't done anything to make things easier for us. Things have only gotten worse. Not saying she's to blame, but she certainly hasn't done anything to make the job better. Communication - Terrible. Changes get made without telling us, making our jobs even harder. Culture - This company promotes inclusivity, a lot, which is great. Everyone should feel comfortable being themselves, without feeling hate, or judgement. However, allowing employees to put up social/political propaganda is highly unprofessional. When I come to work, I don't want to know or see what social organization my colleagues support. I wish they would keep that out of the work place. Phones - They might not tell you this when you're interviewing, but we're treated like a call center. We have to take calls from clients that aren't our own, and resolve the clients issue, even when it's something we've never been trained on.
I’ll try to keep the cons to the major points. The product is outrageously convoluted. This affects everyone. It makes it difficult to sell, because it’s also expensive on top of being confusing. It makes it difficult to train clients on, because it takes 3 months to give new TSRs even a cursory understanding of the system. Functions desperately need to be compartmentalized. The sheer amount of terminology someone has to learn to use this thing, let alone TEACH it is insane. Paycom can do a lot for clients, but it’s horrendous to use. A lot of this will be automated in the future, or Paycom will suffer. AI is is taking off everywhere and no one is going to want to do this stuff manually. They’ll want to tell the system their information and have it all done for them. I guarantee other companies are working on that, and Paycom will be left in the dust if they don’t as well and simplify their system. The culture. Wow. I’m not really sure where to begin here. I’ll just state the things I’ve witnessed during my time here: It’s a meat grinder. It’s not the only company in the country like this, but that doesn’t make it okay. Paycom thrives on hiring primarily two types of people: recent college grads that don’t know they could have it better, and those who are so desperate for a job that they don’t care. This is an absolutely massive percentage of Paycom’s workforce. People don’t seek out working at Paycom for its innovation, culture, or reputation like they do at other tech companies. Everyone is constantly stressed. This is because of some constant combination of a bad product, bad clients, and/or a bad environment at their office. I’m not even sure how members of the Sales team are still standing sometimes. The different departments don’t respect each other, and it feels like that’s by design. Not just in any particular regional office, but at Paycom as a whole. TSRs and Sales don’t always get along, but that doesn’t scratch the surface of when it comes to our relationship with other departments. I’ve noticed others love to complain about NCS, PSD, and anyone below their pay grade. This probably has to do with the fact that we don’t really collaborate in any meaningful way that would ever improve bonds between us. It’s very high school - a trend you’ll find at Paycom. Also, I’m not really sure my fellow TSRs are aware of the immense workload that NCS and PSD are put under. I think that is kept pretty well under wraps, but when you seek out that information and realize how many clients they have to deal with daily then a lot of things start to make sense. Middle management is bad, and I mean BAD. I know that’s a common complaint at many companies but here I think it’s actually a very fair criticism. I have no idea what TSR managers and Regionals are contributing besides hounding people on metrics. My manager was very kind and helped me learn the product, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m not really sure what she was doing all day. So, I guess if you want to escape the pain of dealing with the product and the clients, get to management as soon as possible. Last but not least - RTO. Paycom returned to office five days a week. I like socializing in person, but the fact remains that I go to work and sit on Zoom calls all day. Not ideal. I won’t speak for other positions, but being a TSR job can be done remotely. That’s not even up for debate - it’s been proven. So yeah, on top of everything else I stated above, you get the added benefit of wasting gas money on all of it as well.
As this is a very fast-paced company it's important to be agile due changes that can happen daily and/or hourly. You will need to stretch yourself each day to keep up with the pace and professionals around you.
The company culture at Paycom is an instant red flag. At first I believed this was just a New York City problem, but this is a country wide issue. The real root is leadership. The company only promotes from within- the managers and regionals that are put in place have a HORRIBLE track record. They are usually compromised of the ""top sales rep of the year""- these individuals are not meant for management. They are meant to run their show independently and mind their business. However, they are given a platform to lead and have horrible training and managerial experience. This then trickles down to the reps and the ridiculous expectations set from above. The metrics are impossible to meet, there is barely any training given as a new hire and on top of everything- NO SUPPORT. You are literally told to ""sink or swim"". They lure you in with a high base salary and tell you can make MILLIONS- which is a flat out lie. The sales process takes months if not over a year and most times we lose to our giant and more AFFORDABLE competitors. Just not worth selling. This places straight up sucks. No work life balance. Our days would start at 8am and would not end until at least 7pm or sometimes even 8 or 9pm. I can honestly keep going. Just please when you see this- don't believe it's just one disgruntled ex-employee. This is a very common experience for people who leave the organization.
Someone posted on here saying ""It’s surprising there’s not a class action lawsuit against Paycom. The unethical practices that occur from recruitment to promotions to terminations … are the stuff of Netflix documentaries. Many with morals who try to blow the whistle get silenced (terminated)"". For many people this is a reality. If you speak up at Paycom, your days are numbered. It is like you are on an HR termination list. Any mistake and you are gone. HR and leadership claim they have an open door policy and they don’t stand for retaliation but that is not the case. I’ve seen great hard working employees get canned and treated horribly because they went to HR. The reality is you are silenced. If a leader fines out you went to HR about them, they will make your life horrific until you leave. If you don’t leave, they will do whatever they can to get you fired. HR will respond to this review providing an email to state your concerns but you can’t reach out to HR. It’s not safe. There is retaliation. Employees are terrified to speak out because the CEO sues people who speak out against him. Even the bad reviews on here are reported to Glassdoor even if you do not mention names, no curse words, or company info. Then are removed. You have no freedom of speech. The good reviews are a joke, like the 5 start view with the subject as !!!!!!!!! and the cons were NA NA NA. No company has absolutely no cons. The 5 star reviews are mostly by leaders because they are asked to provide good reviews. You can see this since recently as their scores have tanked. Paycom’s image is carefully constructed by their PR and marketing team and they work hard to protect that narrative. Work load is unbearable. They continue to put more and more and more on us and take very little away. Sales constantly over promises and we have to tell the clients we can't do things they were told we could. Leaders leave at 5 while the pee ons work late. Paycom is a very toxic work environment. Decisions made by leaders are unethical, unpractical, and selfish. Paycom throws around how they have therapist available to employees. You wouldn’t need therapist if your work culture wasn’t toxic. This place has some employees depressed, anxious, loosing sleep, etc. Many employees have started therapy because of the toxic culture and leaders bully employees. This place has a cult quality. Leadership seem groomed as they state the same over used lines to employees. They can’t stand smart employees seeing what is going on. They want worker bees and sheep. Employees who remain quiet, work insane hours, put up with the toxic behaviors of those in power. Favoritism is like a virus at Paycom. Best friends pull each other up into leadership roles that they shouldn’t be in. It is all about who you are friends with. Leadership lack professionalism and constantly talk bad about employees, even in front of other employees. Leaders have been known to lie to save their jobs, throwing employees under the bus. Leaders can lose countless employees because they were such horrible leaders, but yet they still get promoted. How does a TL get promoted when so many of their employees have left? If a leader decide they don't like an employee, they will stop at nothing to make that employee’s life miserable. If the employee doesn't quit, they setup them up to fail and get fired. Leaders target co workers, humiliate them in front of the team and clients. It's sad and concerning when employees get fired when they were great employees but because the leader didn’t like them the employee was let go. A co worker was fired. During his review at his new company, he made exceeding expectations. He was a hard working employee at Paycom and at his new company. The difference is the new company is not toxic and he doesn’t have a TL making his life horrible. Paycom’s leadership is the problem and that leadership starts from the top. Most people in Oklahoma know someone who has worked here or does work here and knows how bad it is. You say Paycom and everyone has a story to tell.
The job responsibilities are ever changing. Lots of initiatives that are sometimes hard to keep track of.
Return to office, heavily focused on legal compliance/process, and may feel like a support/call center at times.
In the NCS Department only: -Feels like high school. -Lack of diversity -TOXIC!!! No one is happy and leaders ignore employee needs. -There is always drama. -You will work insane amounts of overtime. -Work life balance is terrible -Internal communication across departments is practically invisible. One department knows something the others don’t which makes it hard to get an answer. -Will announce changes with no explanation. Or after the change has been in place for weeks or months and still no explanation as to why it wasn’t communicated. -Many TLs who do not know what they are doing. -Processes are not fully followed. -Everyone’s answers are different for just about everything.
The work can be challenging and there are definitely days that are harder than others, however you grow from your mistakes or complicated work days.
Paycom experience doesn't matter to Paycom. So if you are a new hire, with 1 year of exp, you will make same as guys working there for 4 years. So eventually, you'll be outdated.
Paycom has been on a downward trend since COVID. Despite still growing revenues and massive promotion of being a top work place, the employee experience has gone downhill drastically. There has been huge rollbacks in the employee events and appreciation that made paycom a great place to work. The hard line on 0 wfh caused a mass exodus with many being lied to about remote position. There have been many rapid fire changes that have negatively impacted employees that were not piloted or even presented to people in the role, giving no option to prevent issues before they arise. This comes from management not being aware of the processes and job duties of those they manage. All the things that made Paycom a great place to work have disappeared in 2019, leaving Paycom an 'ok'place to work that still brags about being a top workplace.
Lack of transparency, more than what job description entails, no true collaboration or communication internally.
I and my Dr submitted paperwork stating that I have a disability and need a very simple, no-cost, and non-disruptive accommodation. I was denied. I was talked down to about how just because I wanted it, did not mean I needed it or that it would be beneficial to my work. Completely disregarding the medical paperwork they required. It is humiliating to beg for something so simple to perform my job, to have to fill out a form detailing my disability, and then they denied it anyway. Paycom does NOT care about their employees.
Micromanaging is at an all-time high. CEO said Zoom was dead and requires all meetings to be in person. This is okay if you have a territory in your backyard, but when you have to travel 3-4 hours to get to these meetings, it’s not realistic. If a prospect cancels on you ahead of time, you are expected to show up anyway (regardless of the distance) and force anyone to meet with you. They praise people who camp out in parking lots for hours to wait for someone to talk to them. The CEO glamorized getting restraining orders from companies because that “shows how much we want their business”. The training is bogus and does not prepare you for these C-Level meetings you have to run by yourself and have no idea what you’re talking about. The sales process also changes every 2 weeks and you are expected to start executing these changes the day they tell you about it. They just run a 20 minute role play and say, “forget everything you learned before and start doing it this way”. If all you care about is getting rich, maybe this job is for you. If you care at all about your sanity, stay away.
I worked for this company quite some time before I made the decision to leave. I didn't leave because of the pay but because the job itself is not manageable for parties who have children, having a life and the fact that my mental health as well as my physical health started to tank. After COVID, we were told at one point that we may be able to work from home for certain reasons (i.e. sick children, children not having school, etc.) and then they came back only to tell us that it ""was not a thing"". However, we would work at the office and then if overtime was needed we could login at home but it was only for overtime. When we had to do overtime at home it was primarily to meet client deadlines for larger clients which we did not have the man power or to get those finalized so everyone would have to buckle down and jump in to assist. For a technology company, they are not very technological. What I mean by this is they are so worried about ""new"" monthly releases instead of fixing older parts of the system that really needed updates so that specialists in both PSD and NCS would have to come up with work arounds, which often left the client dissatisfied and who would potentially leave. The company is so worried about making the client happy that they often forget their people which is why a lot of employees leave here. The expectations over the years have become very hard to manage as they continue to add items to a specialists plate but they don't ever take things away. This position when doing setup is so manual still that it often causes escalations due to the amount of time it can take to setup and import the data to when everything gets validated within the system. Sales will set expectations and then when NCS/PSD gets involved and we tell them we can't accommodate something it then makes the specialist look bad and the client loses trust in that person. The upper management also continues to change time over time and with that the new upper management start making drastic changes that get thrown at everyone from Supervisor and then it trickles down from there. Depending on who you had as a supervisor or team lead, it can be very cliquey and if you are not liked, they will try to find a way to get you to leave.
If you are a work form home sales person, then this is not the best fit for you. The job is completely onsite so keep that in mind.
It isn't an easy job, but the rewards are worth the work.
-Gray cubicles everywhere you go. Halls and halls of gray. Sitting in a gray cubicle all day and not being able to see the sun for 9 hours. -There is zero flexibility. They are 100% back in the office. If you are having a couch delivered and need to be home but are still able to work remotely- they tell you to use your sick time. -There is no company “culture”. You eventually find a few friends that you suffer through the long days with, and that is the only thing that gets you through. -The only reason they sent us back to the office was to give the middle level leadership someone to micromanage. Our numbers were better at home than they were in the office. There is no trust with their employees. -They forced us to come back in the office but we still had every single meeting on Zoom. Even meetings within our own team were on Zoom. So why make us come into the office at all?
Constantly changing environment Scope changes can lead to more confusion In-office only with little option for remote
Pay is low in relation to the demands of the HCM Team Leader role. Direct reports 1-2 years in the role can earn more than their team leader.
Training keeps changing, target market keeps changing, lots of driving and travel, you really are calling the same people twice a week every week and dropping in on them in person. Training is not conducive to how to actually sell this product. Depending on territory you may be gone multiple nights a week.
CEO is an angry and tyrannical leader. People hide so much from him at the company because they are scared of him. If this company has any chance to start being the great company it used to be, CHAD NEEDS TO GO!! Leading by fear is not leading. No ability to have a work life balance, toxic upper leadership, consistent revolving door of upper leadership, micromanaging and fear based leadership tactics, lack of basic tools to make your job easier for a “technology” company, no flexibility with schedule and working from home, sales teams are God and are not held accountable to unethical practices or false promises that are then required to be fixed and cleaned up by implementation, company does not truly care about their employees and only care about money.
n/a - they are very upfront with what the role entails so you know what you're getting into
Doesn't care about their employees as they shift from WFH to in office. Employees where told after signing up for benefits (so unable to change things like childcare FSA) that they would need to find childcare within a month and they would be returning to office with no compensation. These same employees had been told many times that we were permanently 1/4 WFH. They had turned down other job offers, bought houses with long commutes, furnished their home office on their own dollar, and much more. I would say leadership doesn't care but the truth is this is straight from the CEO and he is the issue here. On top of that, there is an issue with no forward movement, low salary compared to industry standards, and many other things.
Not a con, but this is not an 8-5 gig. Not sure you can make $500k+ working anywhere from 8-5 though
Not really a con, but when you work at Paycom, you work.
Management is poor and lacks cohesions
not remote . could pay more
The role itself doesnt provide a lot of incentive to work hard and grow unless you want to promote to a team leader. Specialists who have been here a long time will make a lot more no matter how hard they work. The financial incentive to take on more clients isn't there until years into the role, and even then it is minimal. There can be quite a bit of micromanagement when common problems are identified. You truly need to be internally motivated to stay here. The potential to make good money is there, but requires a perfect storm of hard work, the right team/opportunities, and a solid amount of luck.
high call volumes can get intense
This is a fast paced, growth environment that requires a strong work ethic, resilience, tenacity, and determination. Workload fluctuates with business demands and expectations are high. If you want to be a part of something big, be prepared for that, it's worth it.
No WFH flexibility small office spaces with no privacy for client calls managers that lack confidence and micro-manage.
What they describe in the job description is not what the role entails.You're in training for months but still feel lost. They tell you'll the first year is the hardest. They said you wont be comfortable in the role until 12-18 months in the role, which I didn't like. With the workload, the entry pay should be more. A lot of people don't have work/life balance, they will take work home to prep for the next day.
-Manager out of office often -The day-to-day responsibilities of my position was not completely fleshed out
Soul sucking beyond belief. Leadership is un willing to discussions of alternative approaches to the market and are more focused on arbitrary objectives (Such as setting news over Rev), and actively suppress it. The value prop is good, but the market has been abused for years. High level of burnout. Turn over was ~60% on my 8 person team w/in 6 months.
No cons at the moment
No garage for new work place. Hopefully can move back to head quarter soon
It does not give big tech at all. The free lunches aren't free and not always healthy, during training, I was told I can't wear a hoodie to the office, and other little perks, such as flexibility are not here. We are not given laptops or equipment to work from home with either. Its just different from the other tech places I've worked at, and will take some adjusting
There are too many to list. Leadership is clueless on what employees want, every meeting has to be in person. You will be sales, implementation, customer support, and a payroll expert. Clients are consistently unhappy due to lack of support on the PSD side which makes it very difficult to sell. Managers constantly micromanaging and breathing down your neck, while making you feel worthless as an employee for not meeting the unattainable ""metrics"". If you ever decide to speak up or provide feedback, you are quickly shut down, belittled, and told this is the way things are. My mental health has never been worse since working here, and it is not worth the high pay. I would rather work at Mcdonalds. There is no work life balance here at all and almost everyone wants to leave. This business will not survive if they do not start valuing their employees.
My role at Paycom is fast-paced and challenging. While I appreciate these aspects of the job, I understand that this isn't the role for everyone. Be prepared to think on your feet and persevere through challenges.
So stressful. Management puts it out like they care, but not enough to stop overwhelming employees. Bad turnover in some departments, which means even more stress for the people who stay. Unrealistic expectations. Humans are not capable of doing things as fast as they want and still providing good quality. Even mediocre quality really. Sometimes if you make a mistake they make such a big deal out of it that they make you want to quit. I don’t know. Maybe that is their goal. But I’m not going nowhere unless they make me. I know it’s important for them to say they have work life balance, but that is not the case. At least not three months out of the year. Instead of limiting how many codes someone can take or hiring more people, they just keep loading it on. And then they get mad if you can’t meet their deadlines.
- Pressure to be perfect - extreme organization is a must. You will be handling payrolls for companies who have between 20 - 10,000+ employees - Learning & Development is thorough, but also needs improvement as you will run into situations that are not covered in training - This is a salary position and they will take full advantage of that. You will often need to work longer than 9-5 and there will also be times where you will need to assist with customers outside of business hours - This position is no longer hybrid. You will spend all 5 days of the week in office. - You will not be taking holidays besides Christmas. You will need to request PTO for them because payrolls will be running on holidays as well.
Work from home is not offered at all Cost of living around company building is very high, but the pay is not adequate to the surroundings.
100 percent in office. While this is a good thing for me, for others it might not be.
Having to work with underperforming employees for a loooong period of time than expected.
The company had no regard for employees
Really hard role very fast paced.
There are no cons in my opinion. However, you do need to be prepared to work hard. Each role is challenging but the right person will see that as a benefit to themselves and their growth as a individual.
The quick growth and fast-paced environment can lead to team members feeling disconnected occasionally, but that is likely true with any large organization. The work can be challenging, which personally I think is good for career growth, but if you don't want to be challenged to be better it may be viewed as a negative for some people.
Don’t agree at all with the negative reviews. I have worked at companies that are soul sucking. Paycom pays you to work hard, and the job is actually interesting. It’s a great company. Flexibility with work from home would bring ratings back to a 92%
No cons, just make sure you’re ready to work hard!
Management is poor and lacks cohesions
Base pay is low, so people have to use options from their long term incentive plan instead of saving.
With so many superstars, it may take longer to get noticed for advancement opportunities.
Be prepared to be challenged. This is not an easy role.
No WFH flexibility small office spaces with no privacy for client calls managers that lack confidence and micro-manage.

It's not an easy job, but I have the support and resources I need go succeed. Any job dealing with clients is going to carry some stress, but it's very manageable.
Do not receive enough leads to generate sales Mandatory Friday 4pm meeting

It truly is a high intensity culture. For myself and those around me, we love it. Our teams love it as well and while some days are truly difficult, we are significantly better now than we were despite some of the hurdles we have to figure out along the way. If you have the energy and drive to win both personally and professionally, you will love it here.
I don't fully agree with or understand some upper management decisions, although I do fully trust my immediate supervisors. Your work experience can vary a good amount depending what team you work on. The work itself may not change, but the process and environment ""feel"" will be different. You have a say on where you get placed, and every team works a bit differently, thankfully I love my team. Paycom traffic is definitely noticable. I work 7-4, so I don't notice it as much, if at all. But something to be aware of at 8AM and 5PM.
Work-life balance. They require mandatory overtime.

The product is expensive, but that is the only challenging piece of the sales process. People do still buy an expensive product, and once you can overcome pricing objections you will have no problems selling. You can sell as many deals as you want, but at some point you have a limited bandwidth because you do have to set up the system for your clients.
This job can be very demanding, it is not an easy job and if you come to work here you will be held accountable. Sometimes this can cause high turn over and in turn is hard on the people who can stay as they take over that work load. This job can be very rewarding but you have to put in the work to see the benefits. More competitive base Salary would be nice.

Work life balance At times unreasonable workload expectations
Work life balance is very tough and it’s a lot to take in.
Having to work with underperforming employees for a loooong period of time than expected.
The company had no regard for employees
The pay and level of care they have for their employees. They are inconsistent in their direction of the company.
Slow periods ups and downs in commissions
You will never be happy again. .
Where do I start? What's funny is, they give you surveys on the job that are mandatory to fill out and your manager can see your responses, so you're forced to say something nice. The entire time I was at Paycom, I never received any help or training from my peers or manager - and they prided themselves on that. They force you to do an extensive amount of work during your first 3 months to weed you out. Several of my friends that worked for Paycom actually warned me about their toxic work environment before I started.. now I know why. I received several ""written warnings"" on petty tasks that should have been discussed before being written up. Then when asked about the seriousness of these ""written warnings"" I was told they weren't anything to worry about. This was a complete lie. The entire time they were ""trying"" to find anything they could to kick me out the door and when they couldn't find anything, they over-exaggerated the small things. The company is run by what could be micromanaging teenagers who bully and discriminate against anyone who isn't exactly like them. I would NEVER recommend Paycom to a friend or colleague.
I could go on forever but here are some main points: - Extreme Micromanagement, unlike anything you have ever seen - Ridiculous outdated processes - manually filling out reports that could easily be automatically pulled - Leadership is terrible. Absolutely no strategic thinking, just simply coming in and breathing down reps back to provide status updates on every single thing -The turnover is off the charts.. Almost every quality manager and rep has turned over in the past year or so. They want people who cant think for themselves and have no desire to improve the processes or quality of work. Just come in, work 10 hour days and say nothing but yes - 8AM Monday meetings and 4PM Friday mandatory pointless meetings because they are terrified of someone possibly slipping out of the office early to enjoy their life - You are forced to lie about setting meetings etc, because if you dont you will be written up. When you do lie, you are awarded for it and praised and they use this to tell the rest of the department that what they are asking is possible when everyone knows it isnt
I've never seen someone micro manage you like this. Every VP will tell you they were one or two weeks from getting fired then turned their life around.... LIKE WHAT?!
The worst office politics you’ll ever see in your career. Picks favorites for leadership and yes men Lack of actual industry knowledge on tech, product management, etc. problems retaining mid level and recruiting senior level professionals lead to inexperienced process and an unstable product. Led by a sales ceo with little to no understanding of tech. Brilliant idea and marketing but risky.
They are very strict when it comes to processes. Demanding job
They are slowly killing remote work, don’t care if you have a commute, there is no exceptions to being in office in your assigned days, no staying home, and if you’re sick you will use your small amount of pto for sick time even when you could still work remote Also mandatory overtime, with a minimum of 40 hours or you use pto, no overtime compensation other than a 15$ meal voucher if you work 2.5 hours more than your scheduled work
Low base salary for locations
Steep learning curve, 100% in-person sales calls zero tolerance for virtual calls.
The traffic going in and out of work is a hassle.
Like everywhere else, one's experience is really based on who their TL/Supervisor is. I got lucky, I've had great ones since I've been here, but I've seen others who weren't. Poor TL/Supervisors lead to high turnover and sometimes you see that with particular teams or groups here. Also, I really wish we had some sort of hybrid remote onsite option. A weekly 3/2 split would be pefect. However, given how they're bringing back departments that were predominantly remote, it's probably not going to happen.
This link will tell you the truth about what’s happening at Paycom right now. I’ve never worked for such a toxic narcissistic company (AKA Upper leadership, CEO, and HR). It’s sick. HR is caught up in all of it when their job is actually supposed to be for THE EMPLOYEES. We are your customers. Not Chad. Worst HR I’ve ever worked for. Worst communication I’ve ever seen at a job. They just shuffle us around like mindless cattle. Well guess what? We’re human and we deserve to be treated like it. 3% “raises” once per year is making operations staff suffer when we already weren’t getting paid enough for what we do. Oh and by the way the titles you’ve given some employees was strategically given so that you could pay people less. There are people here with titles that don’t match what they do and you know it. But let’s not forget the sales people. Sales people are glorified and have a starting salary of over $70k per year plus commission when people in operations work with software that doesn’t function properly, don’t get any type of bonuses or incentives, and are essentially treated like trash compared to sales. Revenue driven company. There used to be a culture, communication, and a sense of feeling appreciated. There’s nothing anymore. The CEO has turned on his own people.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Panda-Express-Reviews-E5659.htm,"Great work environment and always an opportunity to grow.
Good benefits but not the best I've ever had. Very nice people at all levels of the company.
Welcoming environment. All the staff got along well and really made the shifts worth it. The managers were always nice and coached us well along with always asking for input and looking for ways to approve. Even when going to other stores or having managers/ staff come to ours to help or observe it was always filled with good vibes and helping each other learn. Definitely the place to be if you’re going to work in the fast food industry. The store manager was always checking up on his employees and taking interest of what they do outside of work to better connect. Pay was always fair but the manager I had definitely got us a few raises over the time I was there. A great advocate for working your wage.
Free food on every shift, thirty minute breaks for every five hours worked. Healthcare if you work 30+ hours every week. High wages
They pay nice and when you get overtime it even better. But its hard to get overtime. Also they get you like at 10ç raise every 6 months.
Great pay, advancement opportunities are available
Lots of hours, discount for food
Free food, better than typical fast food work environment

Good pay and nice coworkers
Great pay and people to work with. There’s lots of opportunities for growth but it takes someone who is discipline, can take feedback well and apply. Encourages employees to take leadership classes, books, self development seminars etc.
Managers are kind and understanding.
Really great when you are promoted
Coworkers are friendly & nice.
Free food on break, that's mostly it
Opportunity to advance within. Also you will learn a lot of useful skills in the culinary world you don’t expect to have going into the job.
Benefits, career and promotion options, promotion assistance, organization
Salary is reasonable but that’s about it.
Good work life balance at position
Great teamwork and easy to get communication skills
Shift meal is awesome at panda
Management was good and understanding
Good pay and structured hours
The people I met at my workplace were all amazing to work with. Maybe it was the fact that the job was demanding, and we bonded as a team. It truly is a team environment. You also get to eat at Panda, the management at my work was pretty generous with this. If a challenging but rewarding environment is what you are looking for go for it!
Very flexible schedule and is great for the first job.
Overall, great people, and easy work as long as you establish a consistent system of work.
good pay - 18 an hour
decent pay free food fast paced fun
Great pay and benefits Learning funds Good Healthcare and 401k Stable company
good pay and benefits package
Great starting pay and it's not difficult to get into a groove
Pay Employees Paid meals Bonus
The overall environment is energetic and fun.everyone helps each other. It's like a family at work. The manager and crew leader/assistant manager were the nicest, most patient and kind people I've ever worked with. Any problems that came about were handled with nothing but respect and they were very understanding and compassionate with all employees. The best place and team to work with. I recommend Panda to anyone looking for a good solid job.
The supervisors were highly caring and the company values ""learning and development"" just as it stated. Their leadership development system was well-planned. Thanks to my supervisor and other General Managers' support, I was able to work through the most difficult days.
Benefits, Pay, Bonus and Free Meal
Great pay and room for growth and free food for on the clock
Free food, decent benefits and some time off.
Free food during work lunch

Pay rate is fair Benefits are great
Quick Fast-pace Fun Friendly Free food for workers
You can get free food, and sometimes fresh off the wok
Growth Focus Lots of opportunities to move up Great pay Supportive company
Flexible time and nice managers
The work environment at Panda Express is generally pleasant. The management and staff were friendly and supportive, creating camaraderie. The company values its employees' development and invests in their growth, which is a positive aspect of the job.
Good environment, team leadership , customer service
Panda Express definitely had higher standards in terms of cleanliness and freshness making it feel more elevated than fast food so I would trust eating there. Free food during breaks! My coworkers were fun but overall is a nice temporary fast food job.
Meeting new people, great break food
Paycheck, great food, good team members

","Very busy and fast paced
I was expected to be able to be contacted on my personal phone 24/7 and frequently had to work multiple 12 and 15 hour shifts in a row. I would have a day off and my manager would text me and tell me that I needed to go in to work because the area director might stop by. But they never came. Worked a 10 hour shift on my only day off for no reason. Also they won't hire or promote heavy set people. They prefer not to hire whites or blacks and stick mostly to Asian and Hispanic.
Literally the customers. People are so rude when it comes to their food and the customers were the only downside to the job.
You will only get promotion if you have an outgoing personality. It does not matter how many years of management experience you have, or if you can show proof that you have increased revenue year after year at your past jobs. They play favorites when it comes to scheduling. Difficult to get 30+ hours every week if you don't pick up shifts.
They are manipulative as hell. They will guilt trip you if you call off or don't come in. They also will keep you in a training position for a long time where basically you do the work without the pay.
A LOT of pressure, be prepared to be constantly worried about things that are above your pay grade, very specific rules in certain topics
Some of the co workers weren’t the best to work with
older panda locations not as well equipped in terms of management, equipment, and store maintenence.
No cons no cons none
Only minimum wage working there and not enough hours for the summer break, must be less than 40 hours was a bad rule to have
Lots of hours because typically short staffed and issues with staff not showing up for scheduled shifts
Can be hard work at times.
Shifts can feel long sometimes.
You have to earn PTO based on hours worked, there is not a set amount of hours given. It can be stressful when short staffed and it can be very high paced environment. Some managers can expect a lot from you especially with financials.
Sometimes management can be stingy - always commenting on portion sizing, food waste (although we cannot take home food for free). Sometimes reluctant to promote people
The pay was bad for work done
Sometimes it was understaffed and really busy
Not a bad place to work at
Sexism and favoritism are prominent at this company. Managers refuse to do anything about sexism and the victims take the consequences instead. I've been harassed by multiple coworkers and have bluntly told management about said harassment and was told that they weren't going to do anything. Regional managers were also aware and do nothing. If you are a woman, I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere. Men are looked out for and given promotions first before women are even considered. During orientation and training, you're promised that managers will always be seeking out promotional opportunities for you, but they are more concerned with their bonuses and own opportunities.

Stressful, lack of advancement in company, work environment

As a Restaurant General Manager at Panda Express, the experience can involve a fast-paced environment requiring quick decision-making and handling high volumes of customers, along with long hours to ensure smooth operations, challenges in staffing due to high turnover rates in the industry, and the pressure to meet sales targets, maintain profitability, and uphold quality standards.
Not develop an environment of freely thoughts and communications. Supervisors sometimes creates stressful on lower levels.
The pay was bad for work done
Long hours on your feet and exhausting.
Sometimes it was understaffed and really busy

hours would be too long for me to have a social life and balance school. the manager was very unprofessional to co-workers and made a lot of of racial jokes.
Managers that micromanage employees Getting reprimanded for very small mistakes Managers want you to give smaller portions than what you are supposed to Never getting all the breaks you are entitled to Rude customers Managers give preferential treatment and promotions/better raises to employees that are the same race as they are or kiss up to them the most Rude shift leads Dishonest managers Managers that ignore you
Tough Job you are oblige to carry heavy things. You are only giving like 3hrs to 4hrs work per day. No bonuses at all only for managers.
in store leadership not well trained and typically unskilled in the industry. High turnover. Won't fire anyone but people quit all the time due to the labor demand. Above store leadership difficult to work with and constantly a revolving door of moving people and demoting people. Heavily favoring the DEI propaganda.
very heavy work load employees are exhausted
The fast-paced work environment is stressful.
Very heavy working and no salary increasing
They'll work you to death, always ask for more, very little positive feedback regardless of results. You will be micromanaged from the top down and pushed to micromanage those beneath you.
Required to move quickly during rush periods
It is busy at times and high paced.
Force to work long shift, always short of employees
Management is a mixed bagged.
There weren't any cons at this location.
No work life balance Cult like environment Upper management does not view employees as people
- None, it was a great experience.
I started working with panda 2012. I left panda year of 2020 during Covid. I had a bad experiences when I was assistant manager before. Some leaders have favoritism, unfortunately do not care about you, They are hypocrite people. They gossip about their employees when you do something wrong and the whole area talks about you. They do not appreciate or value the good things you do, they only see the bad things and make it seem very badly. There is no work and life balance. Long hours, no quality time for your family. They don’t care about your health, only their bonuses! apparently, I reapplied to my old area, I thought i would be able to go back, the new ACO for my old area called me that i can come back. I submitted my application, then I got emailed for background check , then couple hours passed by, the manager texted me to call him, I called him then he said I got denied, I am shook, when I just did background check for another job I passed, I am independent contractor for DoorDash, Personal liaison, and I was working for a big corporation company three months ago. They are questioning me whether I did something wrong with my application, I doubt it. I input the correct information. So why can’t you be straight forward to me, you don’t want me back. I was excited about returning to work. It’s all about being truthful with your words! We’re all human beings who have feelings because you would feel the same way. I am sure you will be upset. It’s not acceptable why would they lie for! Be real and Man up with your words!
Super stressful and lots of rude people
Bad working conditions and working environment
Too much work for the pay. Yes the pay is competitive, but working 12 hour shifts with few breaks is not worth it.
Horrible management creates a very toxic environment. For instance, harassment, crude behavior, and gossip. Very bad for one's mental health.
A good work environment can be based on your coworkers.

In a restaurant there’s always a bad egg.
Steep learning curve for new hires
customers were the worst ever
Hours not that good. Lots of shift ran with no workers
Long hours on your feet
Tough Job you are oblige to carry heavy things. You are only giving like 3hrs to 4hrs work per day. No bonuses at all only for managers.
You should work in weekends
Super stressful when it becomes busy
Management doesn't seem to care goo much
Large workload per shift. Between cooking, prepping, washing dishes, and maintaining a cleanly work area at all times can be daunting. You get used to the work and fast paced environment.
Often overworked, unconventional locker rules
There’s are too many to list.
Pay was not where I wanted it
Non flexible Schedules depending on managers
Very busy all the time
few to little benefits for full-time workers
It gets busy and some coworkers are not the best to work with
Panda Express is a very rewarding but it is also demanding. The hours do feel long, especially for people who dislike hot environments. You will also meet plenty of strict by the book people because of the frequency of checks from upper management.
Not much opportunity for growth, very stagnant.
Sometimes not everyone pitches in their weight.
everybody lazy af manager too strict
long hours hard labor have to be a people person
Long hours Excepting perfections always Pay alot of attention to little details Challenging culture No praise
can be stressful as is the food industry
Management is a mixed bagged.
No work life balance Cult like environment Upper management does not view employees as people
Weight gain.... employees can eat for free every break.
High associates turnover and numerous management adjustments. My supervisors changed four times during my time at Panda. Part of it could be because of COVID. There also can be a lot of stress dealing with associates' call-offs, guest complaints, and company visits from the higher-ups. It takes a certain level of persistence to deal with the hard days, especially at the beginning of this career.

Try to overwork you. Don’t fully explain the duties.
Management was a little too strict on newcomers
Time availability, career growth, company management, store management, etc
A lot physical work Can be challenging to hire people
Hard work, just like any other fast food restaurants
The fast-paced nature of the restaurant industry is prevalent at Panda Express. It can get quite busy during peak hours, and you may be required to multitask and handle multiple orders simultaneously. One of my challenges was the occasional difficulty maintaining a work-life balance, particularly during peak times or when understaffed. These situations demanded longer shifts or additional work hours, which could be physically and mentally tiring.
It’s a hot working climate
The management was terrible, most of them had power trips. You are not allowed to take tips instead you have to haggle donations for the red cross out of customers. They also send random undercover people from corporate to see if workers are slacking. It’s not fair because they will purposely stress you out to see how you handle it and then write you up if you mess up. Honestly just too much for a job that pays a few quarters over minimum wage.
Can get stressful during rushes
Absolutely racist company. Just look at their current GM staff. Hiring staff are ALL part of their ideal racial makeup. If you want an actual career, seriously, do not waste years of your life moving up the ladder thinking they will give you a chance. If you're thinking of applying, just don't; it's a complete waste of time. Don't think I'm right? Think I'm foolish? Just Google them. Multiple EEOC lawsuits and complaints. The state is CALIFORNIA sued them for this very issue. These complaints go back for over 20 years and are still happening. If you want to become a GM, forget it unless you match then race they want. They're hiring multiple GMs in my market, yet they keep refusing to give anyone a second interview that isn't their own. I know one person who has over 18 years management experience, including fast food, awesome references even from team members, two degrees, and wasn't given a second interview even after crushing it in open interviews. He is caucasian. Consider yourself warned.

Fine things occurred daily yes
was a good flexible place to work and very well organized
Fantastic San Diego manager. Training opportunities.
Great boss Great work environment Great colleagues
Flexibility in the role, prioritize time with family. Benefits are okay, but costly considering this is an insurance company. If you can get approval, education benefits are good.
Only pro I can think of honestly is some positions you can WFH. that's it
Plenty of PTO, work from home
22$/hour is nice. Working remotely.
Perks are programs you have access to, bonuses if your stats are within their criteria. Health coverage is decent. Pay is decent in itself but realistically not for all the hats and tasks you're required to do. Overtime is occasionally offered. The helpful co-workers were a big plus. Working remotely is great but you will need self-discipline.
Livable wage (not great but more than minimum wage), PTO/holiday is above national average, remote position (I started out working in the office before pandemic), standard work hours 8:30 AM-5:00. Open door policy to management. Managers are approachable (but are extremely busy).Colleagues extremely helpful and encouraging.
Wide Network: Aetna has a broad network of healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals, and clinics. This network allows members to access quality healthcare services across the country.
PTO Work Flexibility Work Travel Amazing Support from Management Positive and Happy work environment Graduate School Benefit (up to 3K per year) Easy to take PTO, no awful guilt tripping! 26 days off per year (this includes holidays)
Benefits, pay, good hourly work forfe
Paid Time off is pretty good starting out. Work from Home.
I like being able to work from home. it is nice to have the flexibility to attend appointments. my team is amazing and my peers have grown to become friends.
1. Work from home 2. Pay is acceptable 3. PTO amount is also acceptable, but...you have to find your own coverage.
Overall the company is Great! There are some supervisors that make the job harder then what it has to be and the workload is overwhelming for the amount of pay. Benefits are great as well.
-Some co-workers and some feedback from customers -PTO hours only (not the concept) -bouns
Pay, time off, IT tools, team cohesiveness

Ability to meet people all over the enterprise, job mobility
Working remote is great love it
It is stable work environment.
You are allowed time off of phones to assist with projects in other departments that can last for months! I have assisted the Claims dept, Special Enrollment Team, Service Advocate team. You can be appointed to leadership roles even as a CSR, I was appointed huddle champion and participated in this role until I stepped down due to work/life balance issues. The individual supervisors are wonderful. Responsiveness and effectiveness of management declines the higher you go. They send out surveys often and use them to make changes, so please complete them! The perks of the job are wonderful. They paid for my sons daycare to the tune of 500 per week for six weeks at the beginning of the pandemic, and his daycare was a family member that would come over to watch him. They approved this! There is a wonderful employee recognition site where you can acknowledge anyone and earn points yourself to really cool rewards. I could go on and on, but I love this company.

Flexible hours able to WAH
work from home remote position
They have great benefits the best I have ever had.
Work life balance is incredible.
yearly bonuses and raises and opportunities for growth
Did have good IT support when needed - pay was decent but hours were very long
Remote Work, lots of training, and live audit trainings weekly. Very helpful.
I enjoyed a remote position. My manager/director and team were great to work with. The organization and culture was great!
","The pay could be better.
Indeed twas a time spent
verry agressive culture overall. managment could have been better
Low end of salary scale for the industry
Pay not reflective of inflation Company pushes their morals on the employees
Micro-managing more than what is reasonable. Ability to promote and grow, but no support or mentorship within the role once you're there. Unrealistic targets and metrics, no consideration for staff individual strengths if not fitting the metric mould. Uneven pay equity. Below industry standard, unequal across roles for similar experience and backgrounds. Uneven pay distribution. Lack of consistent messages from leaders and leaders are not on the same page. When a decision is made and rolled out to staff, anticipate the message changing multiple times and to be delivered with urgent turnaround. Expectations to be available after hours and on call without compensation. Outdated annual review structure. Next to impossible to be recognized for performing above expectations and next to no compensation for those contributions, other than to be expected to do more in coming years.
Unnecessary amount of workload.. let's start here... You don't get credit for all they expect you to do for ""metrics"" . The expectations for the position is ridiculously unrealistic and they continue to add requirements for ""state contract""... I just quit and joined another competitor which simplified its workload for it's employees. FOR THE SAME STATE. Lol.. and contract satisfaction. Turnover rate is EXTREMELY high and retention for new employees in case management department is very low. they can't keep anyone. they penalize you for lack of assessment completion which has ZERO to do with you and more often to do with members being unable to reach. Health benefits are bogus to be so ""high on the Fortune 500 list"" last i checked they stopped bonuses every year now. Applied for 37-40 internal positions and did not get a single one. even with a spotless record regarding work performance and no disciplinary action, leading me to believe they will bottleneck you into being stuck on a team where you can't transfer if they really need employees for that department but they won't tell you. no exit interview upon resignation. just a crappy company. good for couple years experience and bounce.
Aetna is not backfilling senior positions, so ability to move up in the company is getting less and less
health insurance options are poor. holidays are few and far and in between. accrual based pto is mediocre. bad middle managers. micromanaging metrics. they expect employees to be working every second even though studies show microbreaks are better and actually improve efficiency. every hour is tracked. every minute is tracked. every second is tracked. bonuses aren't elaborated on and if you got hired too close to the bonus, you won't get it anyway so ignore whatever bonus they're trying to sell you on when considering to work here. middle managers care more about defending dodgey practices and processes than actually making improvements. time is wasted literally talking about how a set number of out going calls didn't happen. they want you making 6 outgoing calls an hour. System problems? too bad. Long calls that need interpreters? too bad. difficult members? too bad. you'll need to document every reason you didn't hit that number. they care more about the numbers they can put on their resume than the turnover dollars they are costing the business. if you can jump when they say jump and be a good lap dog, you'll be just fine.
No job is perfect, but phone stats required are unrealistic; probably due to ones who felt remote work meant slacking, which ruined it for us who actually sit at our desk the entire time working. 20 wk training was hit or miss w/topics requiring more knowledge. Occasional confusion on procedures between other employees/supervisors. Prepare to do most of the learning/research on your own. Feels like too many programs used to get info needed. Also, make sure you are planning to stay a year before leaving or the bonuses given will be taken back.
Position entails normal inbound call center duties. Quality and AHT are the main things to focus on. Adherence is crucial. Members are part of an under-served demographic which brings on its own set of unique challenges. No policy protecting reps from from verbally abusive callers. When I started, we were responsible for handling calls for Aetna Better Health of Texas, and Parkland Community Health Plan, which is a Medicaid plan funded in part by Parkland Hospital, a large hospital in Dallas, TX. Towards the end of my time there, Member Services was slapped with a new policy requiring us to handle calls for Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and Florida. We had a two hour training to prepare us for this huge undertaking as each state has its own specific rules for handling and documenting calls. This was a disaster to say the least. Provider network calls were a huge source of contention and frustration as we were expected to provide members with doctors in their network. This sounds reasonable enough, but not so much when the company has not bothered to update the provider directory FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS!!! This made the directory pretty much useless and nearly impossible to assist the member with finding a provider who was accepting new patients. We were also expected to confirm with the provider that they were by placing an outbound call. We were required to provide at least three, while driving our AHT up exponentially. If the member was trying to find a specialist, the offerings were even more slim. We were also expected to schedule appointments for the members as well. I disagreed wholeheartedly with this practice, as I feel that barring some sort of condition or disability (if this is the case, then someone else should be making your appointments anyway),all adults should be making their own doctors appointments. In addition to that, we were expected to direct the member to various community resources like WIC, where to get car seats and breast pumps for free, food banks and shelters, etc, and to keep track of the incentive programs offered by the plan itself. We were also expected to do this for the out of state plans as well. It was extremely difficult trying to direct someone to a place in a state I am not familiar with. Additionally, these resources were subject to frequent changes which only added to the frustration and stress when we would get calls back from angry members when they weren't able to take advantage of a resource that we directed them to. Every week, there was something else we were required to do on our calls with no increase in the AHT requirement. Do more in less time. After working remotely for a few months, there was talk of going back to the office which I was not interested in doing. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Oh, and tuition reimbursement is offered, but it is nearly impossible to get as they play games and make you jump through hoops to get it, and if you actually do get it, it's not what they initially said it would be, further adding to stress and frustration, and depression in some cases. They tell you that you can apply for jobs in other departments or a higher position in your own department after a year, but the truth is nobody ever really gets promoted or transferred to a different department. Summing everything up, if you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you don't have a job, by all means go for it, because something is better than nothing, but make it a point to keep applying for other positions in the meantime, because there is better out there.
I like everything in this company
Grumpy members but I love them anyway they are great no matter what kind of day they are having!
Lay offs ocurred at least twice. 2 weeks prior to lay offs, site lead made it very clear that employees who were on Family medical leave would be first to go!!! Totally illegal. But they make you sign form saying u wouldn't sue in order to get any severance pay!!!
Supervisors/management is terrible. If a member is upset and asks to speak with a supervisor-Good Luck getting one to help. The company ONLY care about getting members off the phone. You will be penalized for actually trying to help or solve the members problems. The pay for what you are required to know is a slap in the face. Only get a quarterly ""bonus"" if you work within VERY tight metrics that are, conveniently, almost impossible to meet. Benefits are terrible, especially considering you are working for an insurance company. The job is extremally stressful and you have no power to actually help people. You will be listening to people who are going through some of the worst times in their lives, and there is absolutely nothing you can do to help them, because the company only cares about making money.
poor support from leaders, compensation is not distributed fairly, frequently told ""it is what it is"" and unable to speak up for self or advocate for employees. micromanaged for almost everything. poor consistency when instructed to do things, will change often without notice
1. If you are an older employee, expect to get looked over for any promotions or lateral moves. They VERY clearly promote employees in their 20's-40's only. They overlook an impeccable work record, NO sick days taken, 100% on audits, completion of their program for those wanting to advance at the organization, being a team lead, and being a preceptor, in order to promote someone with none of those traits. If you are 50+, you are invisible at Aetna. 2. Change is inevitable, but at Aetna, it is CONSTANT. And I do mean CONSTANT. Don't get used to a process, because I guarantee you, it will change, and quickly. They roll out major changes without trying them first on a small scale to see if they actually work. And they certainly don't involve the employees that the change will involve, in the decision-making/brainstorming process. Do you have a question during the mtgs? Too bad. Email them the question. See where I'm going here? Chaos, frustration and unbelievable stress is the norm. Their answer to all of that? They allow us access to an app to decrease our stress. Nice.
For the amount of work you have to do and dealing with so many different lines of customer service they should offer a higher pay.
-they don't pay your full net bill because of Motus -wishy-washy rules and supervisors -micromanaging -no trust -assigned breaks and lunch if you missed it, you will get consequences if you dare
CIO talks a good talk about work/life balance but manages more like a dictator. Little to no communication from management about personnel changes and shifts in priority/general information. Developers overworked with robotic tasks and discouraged to innovate to make code better. VERY top heavy with VPs.
Once you get hired you will likely not get raises unless you get promoted. CVS considers your bonus your raise so prepare to be out priced by inflation.
Lay offs ocurred at least twice. 2 weeks prior to lay offs, site lead made it very clear that employees who were on Family medical leave would be first to go!!! Totally illegal. But they make you sign form saying u wouldn't sue in order to get any severance pay!!!
Biased HR and certain policies and procedures. Not to mention this is a company in which one of the medical directors admitted to denying clinical review cases without reading them.
Very little room for growth
The pay is horrible based on the current cost of living and the amount of responsibilities. It was also very hard to transition out of the claims department
There were obvious clicks and if you were not in one you had a hard time
For the amount of work you have to do and dealing with so many different lines of customer service they should offer a higher pay.
The role was very fast paced. Customers were able to degrade and talk down upon csr's without being able to disconnect from calls.
Company culture varies a lot across teams - some are very good and some are very bad
Scheduled lunch and breaks, bureaucracy for making impactful changes
Not diverse enough in the current environment
Pay is low and the stocks options are not that great
My salary was minimally adjusted each year - now with rampant inflation and the discovery that they're paying much more for new hires, my manager told me that there was nothing he could do to adjust my package, and also that I was being constantly pressured to be back to office despite the dangerous subway situation and growing COVID cases in NYC. And also, very ironically, they offer terrible health insurance benefits as a health insurance - they took hundreds of dollars out of every paycheck, in returns you get a high deductible plan where you at least need to pay 3-4K+ out of pocket before they cover you. What a joke.
You are micromanaged to the nth degree and held responsible for the results of surveys with deceptive wording Managers play favorites You deal with the worst people imaginable in terms of customers and employees Most of your job is either transferring people or saying ""Hey we can't help you but I hope this other person can""
Very old processing system requiring extensive training program but minimal support after training. High production requirement after training but no clear explanation of how to meet production requirements.
Politics, corporate greed, pay disparities.
Training not consistent, hard to get an adequate raise.
Management is behind the times
Health insurance has high deductibles
Huge company, finicky CVS Leadership, constant re-orgs
Benefits could be better but aren't the worst.
The caseloads are too high.
If you are a CSR, expect lots of changes and absolutely NO DOWN TIME BETWEEN CALLS! It is super busy and you will have no time to take a breather between calls. But, that's job stability, no?

Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
Manager/Supervisors make or break this job.
Not very challenging. On the phone most of the day.
Large company without lots agility
very large organization and hard to stand out
If you dont like your supervisor it could be awful.
Most likely advance people in certain “clicks”
Scheduled lunch and breaks, bureaucracy for making impactful changes
Could have better software applications to speed tasks. But company is improving in that area
The bonuses can be hit or miss.

Large company. Limited time off. Benefits could be better.
Politics, corporate greed, pay disparities.
Little room for growth in this position
Program extracurriculars can be time consuming at times and getting corporate development or investment or VC rotation is highly unlikely. Even then, there are limited slots for year three. If you really don't know what you want to do, go into the rotations within data teams in the FLDP. Stay for 1-2 years tops and pivot externally, you can easily make six figures.
Training not consistent, hard to get an adequate raise.
Always reset too frequently. Didn’t have room to move. I was in a role for 16 years and they would not pro me to senior. I was complacent
still work as contractor, less full time employment opportunity.
Long working hours with strict deadlines
None that I can think of
Where should I start. Management does not help you with anything. Benefits are expensive, they only will give 1 person a day off out of everyone even if you request it weeks or months in advance. Between December and February nobody can take days off even if it's Medical related and if you do they count it against you. It's ver very hard to get help when you need it. They lie to get you in there. If you don't have a job at all then maybe you can deal with Aetna until you get another job, but don't quit a good or decent job like I did to work there, biggest mistake I've ever made and I was warned but didn't listen, I hated working at Aetna, dreaded every day even though it was remotely working from home.

They do not care about you having a life outside of work they have an extensive training course that is about 4 months from 8am to 5pm and if you miss training they give you something called an "" occurrence"" meaning if you are given 3 you will be terminated. They are unnecessarily strict during this training and the course is very repetitive. I would not recommend this job to anybody that needs a work/life balance especially first time and expecting moms. They have a high turnover on reps and if you are looking for a decent salary I wouldn't suggest this job.
Benefits suck, help desk is not helpful.
The bonuses can be hit or miss.
Shockingly poor benefits considering they are Aetna...I had to waive getting coverage as my husbands plan is better. I have asked every week for information on job grades/wage scales and it's like I'm asking for the keys to the federal reserve...something sketchy about that. Google searching brings up more cons. related to low base wage, miniscule or no salary increase and their model to only bonus maybe 25% of those eligible. (I'm looking for something better)
-No recognition. -No opportunities for advancement. -Management has checked out. -Awful culture.

Bad health insurance—odd for a health insurer
Taking customer call back to back, time on the phones are monitored closely ex. Breaks and lunches
Only thing is the metrics it was difficult to predict what kind of day you were going to have.
None that I can think of
the pay for certain teams is very and low while other teams get 5 raises are year while having the same performance.
I can't think of any cons at the moment.
I can't think of any.
having to work some weekends, holidays, evening shifts
long hours and layoffs are common
Lots of meetings. Rounds, very time consuming meetings.
I did not experience any Con's.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Baylor-Scott-and-White-Health-Reviews-E4458.htm,"I love Baylor, they treated me and my team really well during the pandemic and it feels like home to me. Good team, love my manager, have been given opportunities to grow further in my career
High payment, remote, low workload
I’m going to be a little
Great place to start and learn new skills.
1. Great schedule, half the week off. 2. Lower stress as compared to most city departments. 3. Decent wage for the work load. 4. Good work life balance as compared to most bigger departments.
They do really try to give the best care to patients
great work environment, supportive and cohesive
- Room to negotiate salary. Was able to negotiate up original salary by 8K. - 6 ""paid"" holidays (New Years, Memorial, July 4th, Labor day, Thanksgiving, Christmas) - 22 paid PTO days (have to use PTO for holidays if your department is off) - Good insurance/ encore points will get you rewards - Opportunities for growth and transfer after 6 months Good training actually spend a week onboarding versus other companies
Overall, Baylor Scott & White Health is a great organization. They put patient experience above everything, but also do their best to help their employees where they can. Benefits are great though. I've had BSWH insurance most of my life, and the brief period of time where I didn't, I really wished I did. Dental and vision are available. They recently added tuition reimbursement. BSWH also recently partnered with Lyra for mental health assistance. My supervisor and lab manager are great people though. They advocate for us when they can and try their best to help us as much as possible.
Most people are pleasant to work with. Good PTO.

Coworkers are fantastic and the reason I stayed so long. Smaller hospitals have a family feeling between clinical staff. No worries of getting laid off & guaranteed OT as they were perpetually understaffed. Can pick up at any facility in the system so long as you maintain your competencies.
Impressive benefits package, but could be better if it weren’t selectively limited to its own network of physicians.
Growth opportunities Mentorship Debt-free college programs Great values and integrity Turnover is low
The resources in a level one are numerous, each patient has two assigned doctors to utilize if something is needed. Most of our nurses will dive in to rescue you and/or your patient as well.
Benefits are ok, management ok
Great culture, I loved working there.
Overall I loved working with those on my team. Everyone was knowledgeable and will to help out wherever needed. I learned a lot from my teammates. Great work life balance and PTO was good.
-Decent pay -Good co workers

Sadly I struggle to see why bedside nurses stay here, if you are compassionate and care about your patients. this is a number driven system first. It is difficult

","I don’t really have any cons
the skill is too specific to jump
Great love do you want me to pick
Some floors can be very busy.
1. Doesn't allow off duty work for police officers 2. Under staffed at most locations 3. Pays a decent wage but still pays a little low for this economy.
Leadership doesn’t always hear their employees
need to get salaries looked at
- having to use PTO bank of 6 days for mandatory holidays without a choice is a bit misleading - Interview process was terrible. Recruiter ""forgot"" to call at interview time and emailed a week later asking to reschedule. Previous rejections, no follow-up or rejection emails. They just leave you out to dry.
It sometimes feels as though because they emphasize patient experience, they forget about their employees. Micro is chronically understaffed and with the recent closing of our call center, we have to spend precious time calling criticals after hours and on weekends. They could also stand to offer yearly inflation-matching raises. As far as I know, we still only get our yearly performance evaluation raise.
Benefits have been reduced, no more extended sick leave and less employer contribution to 401k

Very low pay for the amount of work that you do
Baylor really stinks at retaining top technical talent. They also don't have competitive pay compared to other healthcare companies in Texas much less tech companies in Texas.

Only one... our Director is on a power trip. She micromanages us, takes over calls and just talks in circles making any meeting non-productive, she has to have her hand in everything and doesn't seem to trust her team or even her Managers to do their job. It's really unmotivating when someone is lurking over you, lecturing you at every turn but then at the end saying ""but you are all great!"" It's not motivating! I haven't been here long but in my time, I've seen her drain the life out of our team... and she's over like 2 teams at least. I can't imagine anyone appreciates her (micro) management style.
Low pay for being a PA/NP , a RN will make more then you.
Pay isn’t competitive Politics Staff doesn’t feel appreciated Don’t retain talented staff
Maternity leave, room for growth
There really aren’t many cons
Not the best work environment.
no cons come to mind
They do not keep their word nor stand behind a decision put in place by them. They do not practice the expectation that they demand the employees to follow. They have started phasing out Clinic RN charge nurses and replacing them with LVN charge nurses and replacing staff LVN's with CMA's, due to cost, but not considering the liability of not having an RN in the building.
Majority middle school events for coverage.
Manager is busy putting people against each other, gossiping and bad mouthing other managers. Company has no set training program, work inductions or a QA team. You are at the mercy of your co- workers to get an answer if you don't know how to do something because nothing is documented. Most days it's like a deaf leading the blind.
Pay is not that great
culture of safety, lack of respect and trust, no support from senior admins.
Depending on your department clinic or ER the pay could a little better
Overworked Underpaid Favoritism Unable to take a lunch Expected to work with no training Charge nurse has lack of training/ rude unable to communicate effectively like an adult
uses PTO for holidays that you do not work, have to work some weekends

communication was sometimes poor between units.
I have not experienced any as of yet..
Some staffing issues exist, but that is everywhere. Pay could be better, but it is in line with Texas salaries.
raises are based on the clinics preformance instead of the individual employee preformance. My last raise was 0.65 per hour. They tell you you get paid holidays but you actually have to use your own pto for Christmas, Thanksgiving, anytime the office closed you have to pay yourself out your own pto bank
Pay and benefits is not fair market value.
Hierarchy of jobs makes me feel my job/work environment is less important to them. Understaffing, Lack of funding for new or updated instrumentation.
Would love option to work home
To many opinions. Not treated fairly.
pay is not as competitive as other places
Each hospital is different and each will have their own cons. But older floors need updating on all levels of needs
The pay can be better
If you’re going to get their cheapest insurance, make sure you don’t need to see a specialist because that could take months to even get an appointment. So separate sick pay from PTO. Favoritism, constantly short staffed with no care from management and upper leadership. They don’t bring back incentive contracts to fix these staffing issues despite constant feedback from actual bedside staff. Then they try and act like they will bring back incentive hourly pay just to cancel you and take it away!
The high turnover rate in the department
Starting salary for newer grads isn't as high as the other hospitals in the area
Stressful demands impossible accomplishment’s very frustrating
Upper leadership doesn’t listen to employees opinions on changes that effect us
Pay is low for a suburb right outside a booming city Growth depends on department (sometimes single spot advancement unless willing to move).
They go over the staffing ratio regularly and threatened job if you object, some assignments are not safe, cannot self schedule, PTO and request always denied, scheduled days are never together causing fatigue. If you are not a favorite, you are treated indifferent!
Salary, work life balance is tricky
Corporate culture, lack of diversity in leaders
unmovable to changes or work flow processes improvement. Some of the task are double work and redundant, taking up time.
Manager is busy putting people against each other, gossiping and bad mouthing other managers. Company has no set training program, work inductions or a QA team. You are at the mercy of your co- workers to get an answer if you don't know how to do something because nothing is documented. Most days it's like a deaf leading the blind.
Pay is in line with ASET salary survey, though yearly increases don't keep up with inflation by a long shot. Requests for more staffing, more equipment often feel unheard beyond the supervisor level.
pay is held artificially low
Cant think of any cons
culture of safety, lack of respect and trust, no support from senior admins.
Management not as personable as most would like. Opportunity for advancement is slim if you don’t have the experience.

-very high work load for nurses, they don't hire PCTs to save money and increase ""productivity"" -ALL ABOUT SAVING MONEY-- THEY CALL IT PRODUCTIVITY WHICH BASICALLY MEANS ALL THE WORK LOAD IS ON THE NURSE WITH MINIMAL ASSISTANCE SO THEY CAN SAVE MONEY INSTEAD OF HIRING EXTRA STAFF TO HELP -EVERYTHING IS THE NURSE'S RESPONSIBILITY: even EVS, doing basic cleaning of the rooms when patients are discharged or transferred, doing basic ADLs for the patients, don't expect any assistance everything will be on you, they pay you good and they will make the most out of it -No sick days, low PTO hours, if they have low census and extra nurses scheduled that day they wont keep the extra nurses as help or resource but they will cancel them or send them home AND THEY WILL USE YOUR PTO, I went from 160 hours of PTO to 42 in less than 7 months and I barely took any vacation days, it was all spent to cover my shifts that they canceled -Mirco management -favoritism At its finest: between staff and management, charge nurses, etc. if you're not one of the ""cool kids"" young blonde bubbly nurses THEY WILL treat you differently and it will show -High co pays for insurance -Guaranteed burnout in less than 1 year of working here
pay is held artificially low
Cant think of any cons
Unclear care guidelines - policies are unclear or just don't exist so you will find care variations that can result in errors. Horrifically low compensation even after several 'market adjustments' Expensive insurance that covers less and less each year Upper management does not ""walk the talk"" - they will send email after email of how ""we are in it together"" but crickets will chirp when patients or visitors are beating you up or you're running at critical staffing ratios. Understaffed... all hospitals have this problem but Baylor will expect you to turn over your rooms after discharges, be your own transporter, respiratory therapist, physical therapist and nutritionist and run you with a 10-16:1 PCT ratio and then get mad that ""response times are bad"" on HCAHPS. No room for growth... had to leave the system for a raise/increase in responsibility + pay.
Management not as personable as most would like. Opportunity for advancement is slim if you don’t have the experience.
Employees who have higher education in any leadership role should be compensated accordingly. It seems that only nurse leaders are only paid fairly for higher education in a supervisor role.
Lack of leadership. PTO has to be planned a year in advance. Even singular days off will be denied if an entire week was not claimed on the paper calendar. Staff are allowed to interact inappropriately, speak disrespectfully to each other and upper staff will not address it. Behavior is not addressed but written off as ""They were stressed or having a moment"".
Metrics are crazy, you’ll earn your pay, turnover
Stagnant payrate for therapists over ten year period
If you don't have a degree there is only so far you can grow with the company. Even with a number of years of experience there is a cap to the level of a position you can hold and you can't be promoted to different levels without one. Managers have to fight with HR to retain quality workers without a degree.
-High workload -Very exhausting -Bad management
Work environment amongst employees Lack of communication Lack of adhering to following chain of command protocol
Pay inconsistent for tenured nurses. Increased pay for full time nurses that are new or travelers converted to full time. Very little if any positive feedback and encouragement.
Pay and benefits were always under market.
Big corporation but overall not bad
Poor staffing Inexperienced management High turnover
Management, treat you like children, pay, don’t care about their techs
low pay compared to other mag hospitals
Constant Changes in the structure and managment
Not enough pay for the amount of work
some of the benefits are high priced for offered benefits
The hospital pays lower compared to other hospitals and does not reflect the cost of living in Dallas.
Fast paced and can get hectic
work load can make you loose focus on home life as priority
Management doesn't listen to their staff nurses. Put so much responsibility on nursing staff but provides minimal resources.
Low/average pay, small once-a-year bonus (only if the entire region exceeded expectations),
Pay not the best Cleanliness Weird people outside
Lots of system policies Lack local autonomy

Great coworker relations, respect is showed regularly and disrespect is not tolerated. one of the few places where I've worked where the managers will happily stand up for their employees and do their best for their customers.
Flexible schedule, good money for the amount of work, friendly cowokers
It was good and I liked the management.
Flexible schedule Daily pay Pick up shifts when needed
High volume and established customer base.

","Super popular spot for locals, increased wait times.
Location was not the greatest for making tips
Customer base is abysmal and managers don’t help. It’s like pulling teeth to get anyone to do their actual job. No one shows up on time and because most of the line cooks are new the food takes forever and is often incorrect.
Sometimes the GM was annoying
lots of hours, very scary
Pay could have been better
tiring days at least 20,000 steps a night while working
Bartenders don’t make more than servers
no cons working for chilis bar
Working conditions are awful and little regard for mental health
Managers are immature and hard to work with.
Working conditions are awful and little regard for mental health
None come to mind for me.
Procedures and management change frequently and many people do not stay in this industry long so it feels very unstable because of that.
The pay for sure, it’s disappointing. Benefits too.
High turnover in staff regularly
Hours. Work life balance is hard in this industry.
No free food, which is pretty standard but that’s my only complaint.
Money has gone down since they started having drink and food runners. The runners make 4% of each servers sales, and half the time runners are not held accountable for slacking off but still make decent because they take from the sales automatically. That affects the servers by making it slow service or just a bad experience and causes low tips or no tips.
Management was sometimes annoying and not the best benefits.
High Turnover/ staffing issues Disorganized Management
No big party minimum gratuity policy! I got burned a few times.
Management Inconsistent Tardiness Drama Accountability
The hours are never guaranteed
Too many changes to menu and procedures
Not the greatest pay for anyone with a family.
I can't andestand for this question ❓
Work was busy and stressful
Can be busy and stressful
Tip sharing, so you pick up weight
Highs and lows of business. Less holidays off. Seniority preference.
-Can get stressful during busy shifts -AC doesn't work the best -Low pay
Constant supply of chips (lol)
Really can’t think of anything negative!
you put up with a lot of BS
section based on your guest ratings but they usually don't rate you unless they had a bad experience, the ziosk was annoying
The employees have all been working there for a long time together. It's a little hard to integrate into the group. HIGHLY competitive with sales and GWAP scores. Checks are low and the iPads prompt guests with 18%, 20%, and 22% tips rather than having them calculate.
Working conditions are awful and little regard for mental health
over hired to much in each position i was in.
Having to always do contest.
Having to go into a Chili's every day
They don’t rotate sections meaning they play favorites. The same people will always get the good sections while others repeatedly get the “broke sections.” We call it that because you’re gonna leave broke. There’s a lot of drugs and they even do drugs in the back by the dumpsters.

It can be cliquey, the costumer is always right mentality, sometimes bad employees still get promoted to higher management.
- not much business in my area - tip out to bartender
-Servers and managers let interpersonal conflict interfere with business - They didn't hire bussers because they wanted to save on labor costs. They framed it as a benefit for the servers because we didn't have to tip share, but we also had to do a lot of unpaid labor because of it.
many days you don't make much money and when you dont then you only get minimum wage.
Nights and weekends are a necessity to make any money
-needs to be more organized, top down. -you have to eat standing up -no breaks through the day, if you demand them, yes, but it’s looked down upon by management
Customer service industry so comes with abuse
not sustainable for more than one person household
Tips can be tough in this place
Only reasonable shifts are evening and weekends.
over hired to much in each position i was in.
Horrible upper management, no support
Employees are just a number Terrible work life balance brutal schedules for managers
Having to always do contest.
Staffing can be a pain and you may be asked to work more stations than what you signed up for.
Upper management prioritizes managing labor numbers, sometimes running a skeleton crew even when we are insanely busy. It’s good money but very stressfully
The commute was a little far and the customers weren't always friendly There was also one coworker in particular who is very mean and creates a hostile environment
Slow season Some guests can be rude
Very regulated and the ""grill"" in the name is a lie. Chilis doesn't use a grill.
Customer service is always a challenge in the restaurant business
Varies by management, location, staff, etc.
Money was always a hit or miss just like any other restaurant job.
No cons are applicable for this position. I enjoyed my experience working there.

Low pay and sometimes low staffed
You will be on your feet for long periods of time.
business slows down seasonally, still good money
Big workload most of time
Occasionally understaffed but personally enjoyed the extra hours
Prestos always went down which would slow up service
Bad management and unfair pay for how much work is done
Management sucks in restaurants, almost always, this was no exception. If you have ANY issues with your schedule just know you’re screwed, they will not fix it, if anything they cut down your hours. The only way to get more than 30 hours a week is to pick up shifts that others release, and thats rare because people need money to live. The restaurant is run by teenagers as per usual, and management doesn’t care that they do horribly at their jobs and it effects everyone else. Silverware is dirty.
Couldn't get enough hours, was unable to work full time, was made to work pass shift
Put me on the floor to work alone without completing training; was assigned to close FOH and when I finished cleaning my area the supervisor/manager had let all of the other servers leave without allowing me to check their sections so I had to stay even later and properly clean for those who had not done so themselves
Clean the entire kitchen at the end of your shift which means sometimes go home at 1-2am
It's a mediocre restaurant, no one cares about their job.
I had a 5 star experience up until they made us start using iPads for orders and tipping out food runners 5% of sales. The way this works is say I sold $1000 worth of food, food runners (1 food runner per however many servers are on, ranges from 2-7 depends how busy it is) I’m tipping out $50 which doesn’t sound like a lot but if everyone tips 20% (which they don’t) thats $50 of the $200 I made.
Too much people at the same time.
working late, low pay, understaffed
not every guest tips but you get many tables so it evens out
The job of being a server.
They preach work/life balance but you are still working in a restaurant, prepare your body.
Little pay Late hours Rude customers
I got paid very little and wouldn’t get my tips
Varies by management, location, staff, etc.
The management is not good

Great Company to work for. Very flexible work schedules.
Profitable company, strong focus on the customer, mid western culture, smart talent all around
-Remote life is nice - You make amazing friends through struggling together -The perks -You learn about Credit Cards- since working here it has helped me with building my credit
Am able work from home full time as this location didn’t require return to office 3 days a week. HQ does. Discover welcomes older workers. I get 30 days a year PTO. Since I haven’t been out sick calling in for 13 years have worked here have trouble using up my PTO. Just got back from 3 weeks vacation. Can take 4 weeks off maximum at a time. Eligible employees don’t have to go on Medicare can keep company policy.
I soooooo wanted this to work for me with Discover I love love love them sooo much but I am disappointed unfortunately I joined back to Discover as a rehire ..b/c I was OTC (I didn’t want to leave the 1st go) But I came back ready to work ! But sadly my hopes came to an in I was to be shared on the company social site for mental health awareness month (May2023) and yes I did get excited about this (I know I’m a big kid) hahah so .. I have a “mental illness” and I lokey was extremely excited to be shared you know my picture yeah.. so y’all i follow all the companies social sites told my family blah blah to not even be shared yall.. I know this might seem like a small thing but I really am hurt y’all I really enjoy my time with Discover but other things lead me to leave the company not because of that reason but this was one of the reasons I left because I wanted this so bad to grow and all that glitter and stuff lol the culture is great the customers are awesome to talk to , coaches give great feedback, everyone is passionate about their work but it’s all good Life has others plans for me. That’s all I really had to say.
You get great Benefits,PTO, and Perks
Most of the team members are friendly
This is going to read cliche, but I can genuinely say that the people I worked with made this work experience enjoyable and tolerable.
Good benefits with the option to work remotely
One of those company that treat employees as good as their customers. They take great measure to ensure people have the tools to do their jobs. Management is scrutinized held to high standards when it comes to being effective leaders and are constantly put through training to create cohesive environment. The company is not afraid to spend money to make employees happy and even have everyone at director level and below an extra $1000 when the federal tax bill was passed in 2017
Benefits i guess and being able to work from home.
Good PTO, nice benefits, good training, nice campus, fitness center,.
Healthy work environment Great benefits You have PTO's and SICK TIME available for use. Great experience to build your people skill. Promotes internally. Great recognition events for employees that performed well.
Care about employees, some room for advancement, secure facility, cafeteria onsite, gym onsite
Offer 401k, HSA, insurance, positive work environment
1. 5 weeks of starting PTO and 1 personal day. 2. Extremely well run company from an overall financial perspective. This means the company isn't going out of business anytime soon. Minimal layoffs during bad economies compared to other companies (so far).

Simple job that makes life easy
The biggest pro I experienced in this position were the people. Management for my team was wonderful and knew how to care and properly train for the job role.
benefits paid time off work from home equipment provided
The remote work was easy, if you're starting at the bottom (CSE agent), as long as you endure the back to back calls and track your breaks you can get your stats up and quickly move to a specialty department where there won't be as much of a high call volume.
Decent pay, desire to transform and educate employees for growth within the company.
Pay is decent. PTO is really good!
Really nice people, willing to help you grow
This is an amazing workplace with a pleasant culture, helpful individuals, and a high level of professionalism.

Benefits can't be beat: - PTO starts at 25 days - Medical is one of the best plans I have seen
Good Benefits, PTO and 401k match.
WFH, 401K, healthcare, PTO, usual benefits to be expected from a billion dollar company like this
Work life balance is the best
Great benefits and staff. Feels like family.
Pay started at $18, but the company increased everyone to $19 within my first few months. I received $2,000 sign on bonus spread out over the first year. Received a small increase in my 6 month review, and a slightly bigger one in my annual review. Promoted to team coach within a year and received another pay increased at that time.
Pay is decent Work from home everyday
Great benefits, team leads work together and they are super understanding
Beautiful work location Up-to-date technology Strong commitment to diversity High level of dedication by peers (not management)
Company overall is good. Financials are good, business is good.
great values, modern tech stack, over 3 weeks PTO starting
They have great insurance options and it’s all wfh. I do feel like the management does care about you but obviously it’s a business. Their pto/sick time is the best I’ve seen for a large company like this if 120 hours of PTO and 40 sick that are pooled together.
The onsite fitness center is superb!
Good pay, good benefits, generous PTO, supportive colleagues

Very few I can think of.
Ever since new CEO Roger H took over in 2017, there have been unprecedented number of executive exits. Shocked to see so many senior level leadership forced out by Roger, especially when he was the #2 person in the company for 15+ years before taking over as the CEO. Org changes every few months and everyone talks about how now change is the only constant. Board is also almost brand new with most having started within the last 2-3 years. Company seems to have lost its way ever since Roger took over the reigns.
Started this Journey with this company!! I felt valued and was excited about the job until that feeling wore off. Day one we had a wonderful intro to the company was told that we were valued and that we were family . going through the milestones each trainer had a different technique . Our First trainer was the only competent one within the company! after completing the last step to transition into core. The company told us we were being moved with a team meeting with me and my peers! Told us that we had no *SAY* due to a overstaffing issue with being in training we were tossed into a5 week training! GET THIS.. the trainer for our classes was thrown into training us and was not a DEPARTMENT TRAINER!! THE SYSTEMS ARE SLOW and Not something you are wanting to deal with on the daily! -I was let go in a 5 min meeting with my TL and HR rep! I was not warned about any misconduct only the conversation of being laid off. there has been no communication between the company and I . **THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR FACE!! STAY AWAY!
Benefits are sketchy for older workers starting there. For instance a formula had to work a number of years before age 50 I think it is to be eligible for retirement insurance. There is no retirement plan for new employees. Retirement pay for existing workers was frozen a decade ago so doesn’t increase. After 10 years of service benefits don’t increase as much. Even less so for 15 and twenty years service. The HR doesn’t tailor benefits for employee sectors like tech to be competitive with other tech companies yet want to recruit the best and brightest tech. Discover doesn’t let eligible employees keep their company policy and get Medicare Part B. Would save Discover a lot of money as Medicare is then primary. Nor does HR offer any group Medicare supplement plans. The dental insurance even the premium plan only allows x-rays once a year.
They don’t keep their word.
Change teams and Team leaders to often
- They work in agile, but the company removed the Scrum Master role. So, the PO works as a Product Owner, Scrum Master, Project Manager, and needs to display Product Manager skills if you want to advance with the organization. - They work in water-gile. No PI Planning, but you will meet five times a week to discuss the same thing and receive updates. Why!? This is essentially waterfall. - Remote employees have 0 opportunity to advance after level 8. This isn't public knowledge but I believe this will make most remote team members resign and the company can avoid layoffs. They truly want everyone back in the office. - Most of the leaders didn't earn the position. They received promotions and they are learning as they go. As an individual contributor, you can feel it. Accepting this position was probably the biggest mistake of my career.
Leadership eliminated it’s flexible work arrangements and has mandated a return to office policy. The CEO has been clear that he “doesn’t believe in work life balance” and is tasking leaders to micromanage employees by tracking badge-ins. While I personally wasn’t impacted, it put me in a position to lead my team with a “do as I say, not as I do” approach which I was not aligned with. As a remote employee, I didn’t feel like I’d have the ability to grow my career unless I wanted to move to Riverwoods. In a new hire call, the CEO answered a career advancement question and stated that we’d most likely have better career opportunities if we were in the office.
I had a terrible team leader, she never responded to emails, calls from her team. Every other week we had to experience a new team due to her negligence, “cough, cough” excuse me, her illnesses. If you are on a call and receive assistance from a manager, and the information given is incorrect you will receive a compliance(can lead to termination) and no consequences are given to that employee that has provided incorrect information. I received an email stating that employees CANNOT work extra hours, imagine a billion dollar industry denying employees to make extra money that have kids, bills etc. I was laid off by my team leader, whom I’ve only met with 3 times and each time she was uncomfortable and rushed through the meeting, until she told me I was being fired. I was fired for being over my pto 1 hour, forget the time and energy I’ve put into this company with 100% rating from customers. There is no room here for a black female who happens to be homosexual within this industry. Fortunately, I was able to be a groundbreaking employee whose mom just passed away and brought new clients to this god forsaken company. Thank you for allowing me to catapult into a better situation.
Some people might say the company can be a little too progressive at times. If you’re someone with traditional values that doesn’t necessarily align with mainstream narratives you might find yourself rolling your eyes at company wide emails and web based trainings that you have to be apart of. Politics would always be talked about in many ways and became annoying having to listened to. Management didn’t really do anything to stop it. Always had this vibe where if I didn’t lean a certain way politically it was probably best to be quiet.
Everything from the top down as other reviews have posted about management and team leads. From the time i started with Discover to search for a better career path i quickly realized the mistake i had made by joining this company. The training i had was beyond confusing and their was a lot of miscommunication from the trainers and team leads who barely know the answer themselves. A lot of the time the TL’s are never working. They are always taking care of personal things on company time. “I hve to leave early today” like every day never there to support or grow or coach you like they claim they are there to be. They claim you can move up quickly at the company as a lot of people love sharing their story on how they made it. However its not as easy or as quick as they make it seem. Coming into this role over qualified i thought they would quickly notice my potential and ambitions but it goes unnoticed especially when I’m there answering questions and helping colleagues get the right answer. When excuses from management are, “sorry I’ve been busy today”. “Busy” should not be a word in your vocabulary as a people leader
Not innovative, little flexibility for remote work, very slow decision making, bad bonus structure. Since the new CEO took over, there were many leadership changes whichi in turn forced good long term employees out. Now it is utter chaos. A lot of progress over the years has been reversed. The head of HR comes from McKinsey. He is a management consultant who does not have a clue about managing people and how to run business in real life. The head of our department does not spend time with employees. A lot of emphasis now on Compliance, but I don't think they hired the right people. New management is siloed and detached from reality. Overall, Company culture is eroding.
*It is a call center, so you deal with customers on a daily basis. *Most jobs will require you to ask to work 1 day in the weekend, unless you are part of one of the specialty departments ex, Deceased handling, Back Office department, Wires, etc.
Don't really look at your true potential, seemed to be favoritism at times
They go based off of pay grades. You can have an upper management position and be making a similar amount as an account manager, which seems unfair.
1. Once you are hired at a specific title, it is almost impossible to be promoted EVER. The outgoing CIO Amir has made significant changes such that it is virtually impossible to be promoted. Anyone who claims to have been promoted had to work crazy hours, brown nose, and go through the same interview process as with other external hires. 2. Very frequent 24/7 production support since Cognizant was able to negotiate support out of their contracts. 3. No opportunity for realistic growth due to the outgoing CIO Amir's Dreyfus model. You can lead multiple engineering teams and build cutting edge systems. No chance for promotion and management will only focus on those who speak the most in meetings. 4. Pay is tens of thousands below standard market value. Management is willing to let people leave for other companies and will not match the salary.
They changed the attendance policy the beginning of 2023. They should have kept it the way it was
Wish it was more flexible
high paying tech positions all wants loads of experience
Culture has changed for the worse

Discover DOES NOT act with what they preach on HR level despite all the little HR harassment classes you must take. They motivates you to report whatever strange behavior you feel from either colleagues or management, however, when you do, they WILL try to brush that off and asks you over and over again, in every call, WHAT would you like them to do? If you do end up suggesting to them to be moved to another team due to management harassment they will avoid doing it and will try to win you by exhaustion. WATCH OUT! Do NOT feel intimidated. One last thing. In higher director roles, you will not see that much diversity. It's sort of a white boys club.
high paying tech positions all wants loads of experience
pay is not that good
The biggest downside is the recent announcement of moving back to the office a mandatory minimum 3 days/week for those in the Chicago & Houston metro areas. The delivery was tone-deaf and does not live up to Discover’s supposed Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DE&I) standards. Most of all it is not equitable as it punishes those who stayed within the area as their approach going forward states that none of the previously upheld Flexible Work Arrangements would be honored. Additionally it hinders the work/life balance, which they used to say was a big priority. All of this for supposed “collaboration”. When half of a given team is remote, how this promotes collaboration is a mystery. The message is clear: they have large buildings which aren’t being used. In order to make sure they aren’t losing money on an empty building they own then they’ll force people to change their lives and how they’ve adapted over the past 3 years, regardless of family/pet care or current life situation to ensure their parking lots are overflowing and there isn’t enough desk space for everyone on any given day - as was the issue before the pandemic.
I worked over six years for Discover and I’ll admit I was one of their employees that told people to apply. However they let me go after severe medical issues and a few days weren’t covered through FMLA pushed me over their attendance rule. This after being one of their top reps on the floor for years, never having attendance issues before, being very open about what was going on, and working Fridays and Saturday on my team alone, and nothing was done about this for a couple years, even though I was promised again and again they would fix the issue. 2-3 years ago, being fired over medical issues would have never happened. Management would fight for their employees if they had good reason. HR took this out of their hands and made it black and white with no exceptions. The beginning of this year was one of the scariest and most life changing times of my life and it really felt like no one there actually cared. I loved this company, but I suppose that’s just part of the bottom line of things. In the last few years there has been a constant change of upper management in customer service. I watched a person who was brought into HR multiple times for sexual harassment on 3rd shift, being sent and promoted to a coaching position on the day shift, because they were so desperate for mid management employees. They also promoted multiple “newbies” for the same reason. Discover supposedly had one of the best years they ever had in 2022, yet found any reason to lay off long time employees, while hiring lower paid employees in droves. Terrible communication between departments. Absolutely the worst training when they starting remotely. I’ve never seen employees come out of training basically knowing nothing in all the years I worked there. Even if you give your all, dedicate your entire career to them, meet your stats, and rave about them to everyone, you aren’t really “part of the discover family” you’re just a number like any other large company.
Mgmt pushes workers with unreasonable deadlines. There is no work/life balance. No sick days provided and no data science work.
Not the greatest work and life balance. They are a 24/7 open company but only requires some of the units to be 24/7 and work weekends. They give you PTO but then punish you if you use it when you want to instead of when they think you should. They come up with changes to procedures weekly and then grade you on those changes without first working out all the kinks leaving a lot of questions unanswered and too much room for error.
Less holiday PTO days provided Pay is less than market rate Promised fully flexible working schedule, where people were allowed to be remote. Then suddenly went back on it and requires people in office 3 times a week.
STATS!! Not that they are hard to keep, but they should allow the agents a little more time on the phone with the card members. You are supposed to try and keep it under 2.5 minutes. Which is ok and probably great for some customers, but others need a little more time and you are supposed to keep them on task. (the customers) So, no personalizing the phone call at all. Also, if you are unable to process a credit, refund or whatever the customer is asking for and no matter how well you did on a call the customer can give you a bad review and that counts horribly against you when it comes time for a review.
Not a lot of options for non-phone positions.
Culture has changed for the worse
HR not responding in reasonable time frames, Extensive hiring process, Excessive training that's hardly useful for the job.
Other banks pay more and not so many raises
Quality standards can be challenging You'll have to remember a lot of terms and disclosures
nonstop calls for 8 hours, can't request unpaid time off
Banking side is still working out policies but its not bad.

You are not very likely to “move up” the company ladder efficiently. I expressed interest in management from my starting day. I worked for 3 years and was offered one raise and promotion. When you are looking to move into a team lead role, they do not solely look in your specific department. There were times where we had to train the new team lead on our job roles, because they had been promoted from a completely separate department.
six months minimum before can change schedule call volume- no break in between calls
The FMLA. I had FMLA and they still let me go over days they did an override approval for, but they will look for any loophole to get you out.
Confusion around product roles and responsibilities, likely tied to the move toward product centricity. Lack of role definition and understanding makes product management more challenging and leads to people stepping on each others toes (some friction with ownership of tasks). Leadership doesn't always communicate with and involve key players and mid level management in relevant product conversations or decision making.
I found it really hard to advance out of the call center (remote) position. I applied for several opportunities that I felt I was qualified for, yet I had an odd feeling that my wasn’t chosen because of my age. I had excellent scores and stats, however - I guess that doesn’t advance someone in their 50’s. Also: you really need thick skin to take some of the calls that are back to back.
Riverwoods office isn’t best location for young people
I seem to be facing some issues with micromanagement, leading to slow growth. It seems like micromanagement is hindering progress and causing slow growth.
It’s a customer service job where metrics matter too much sometimes
Communication was off. Huge company.
Really uncertain times right now with the changes in leadership. Forcing people to come into office 3 days a week and are tracking badges
A ton of metrics to meet each month. Makes it hard to meet incentives. Management will have meetings with the employee to better process. However, they don't always apply the innovative ideas from the employees. It is all about the shareholders!
If you have any human feelings whatsoever, taking customer service calls gets soul crushing very quickly. They'll tell you you'll be able to promote out of it within 6 months but you can only promote to other call center positions. There are 4 huge waves of training that add more responsibilities to your job but your pay stays the same ($17). Not many managers seem to know what they're doing or what it's like to be on the phones at all. You won't be able to change your schedule and will be stuck with insanely busy weekend shifts. There is rarely more than 3 seconds between calls for your entire shift. If you don't want to feel like a workhorse, pass on this job.
Not really anything to not think off
Upper management is clueless to everything.
Honestly cannot think of a downside to working for this amazing company. I feel valued and appreciated.
Have to work a weekend day Schedule fulfillment is strict and based on percentages
Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of what’s going on
Bait-and-Switch Job Duties - Was hired for a specific analytical role. After three months, technical/record-keeping duties added with no training. Three months after that, original analytical role taken away because the time spend on new duties did not allow time to focus on primary role. Zero Job Performance Feedback - Went three years without a 1-on-1 with manager despite monthly requests. Escalation to upper management/HR was no help. Never given opportunity to present to upper management (which others on my team did regularly) despite repeated requests. All work-product produced was presented by managers as their own work with no recognition of who actually created it. Repeated attempts to set the record straight were met with threats of HR action for ""lying to management""
But it is made of people, some are good, some are not. You can end up in a good environment or one that needs improvement.
work can be reprioritized to compliance and regulatory development with little notice
Phone calls can be very busy and overwhelming at times. Customers like to belittle you or act like they own you. You do work a weekend day almost every week and you don’t get 2 days off in a row expect for the one weekend off every few weeks.
Admins are not treated well! A lot of favoritism
Return-to-office mandate for only certain locations with no exceptions for those employees who were hired as 100% remote or those who have no teammates in their local office, limited advancement opportunities
No cons I can think of
Main office is not in the city.
less number of benefits for a full time
Hard to get effective pay raises. Been here for several years and still not above $50k. Less remote opportunities
Communication was sometimes lost when needing assistance.
Low comparison, tech debt, old school mentality
The demands are not worth the pay
Extremely boring! Feel like a parrot.
Work life balance hard sometimes
Return to office policy was not handled well
None with my experience as i enjoyed working with Discover
Compared to competitors, the base salary is way under yet we are told it is comparable. We are a virtual bank who has recently sold off our regional office space yet have a mandate for HQ employees to return to the office 3x per week. This was a pre-covid policy that has not evolved 3 years later when we've had record years and high employee engagement. It is highly disappointing in this current environment. I have always appreciated the flexibility here and up until recently it's been amazing.
No corporate job is perfect but this is for sure one of the better large-scale corporations to work for
Rigid in-office expectations post-pandemic, despite record-breaking successful years of mostly-remote workforce (mandatory 3 days/week onsite, though workforce was promised flexibility) Limits on employee mobility if hired and working outside 50-mile radius of Chicago or Houston offices Poor development of promoted managers, leading to ineffective management style and bad employee development Old white guy corporate mentality Out of touch with progressive workplace models No child care, no free perks like food, bad public transit options, basically lost touch with workers needs
Painfully disorganized Slim career path
Leadership makes decisions that are not in the best interest of their employees. Pay below average compared to competitive companies in the area. Mandatory hybrid 3 days in, absolutely no exceptions and lack of flexibility despite claiming they provide it.
Politics run the show so it’s difficult to advance without “playing the game”
Upward mobility was lacking and they reward more on social ranking rather than metrics and results.
Salary is lower than industry average.
Low salary Huge amount of politics - executives have their own agendas that are pushed against all odds
They have team leaders training you from a different department, people that have no idea what they are doing.
Not much room for growth
Rude customers,not enough breaks , calls are back to back not even enough time to breathe between calls, I want to call out every day, your expected to have customers yell at you all day and still keep a smile on your face
Want you to sound like a robot
Salaries not as competitive Review process is rigged Politics amongst senior leaders Needs more transparent leadership and room to grow within the company
Salaries - pay is below average

good working environment and collegues
The pros of this company are in the logistics department; it is more laid back. There is very little micromanaging depending on your manager. The benefits are very good, especially the Corporate Tuition Benefit, which allows you to get a bachelor's and Master's degree for free without spending any money out of pocket. There is a great office culture with the logistics supervisors, and other group leads most of the time.
Base Pay - better than most jobs in my area for the difficulty and amount of work required Schedule - mostly 2nd and 3rd shift, but that's what I prefer Paid Holidays - New Year's Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Holiday Pay - if you have to work, it's time and a half Annual Bonus - it comes in mid-March, which is nice.
1. Meaningful Impact: You get the opportunity to assist customers with their healthcare needs, making a positive impact on their lives. 2.

Skill Development: Customer service representatives develop strong communication and problem-solving skills. 4. Job Stability: Quest Diagnostics is a well-established company with a steady demand for customer service support. 5. Team Environment: You’ll likely be part of a supportive team that collaborates to deliver top-notch service.
The people you work with most of them are great.

The main cons for the company in the logistics department is the driver union which is toxic, and you must be careful what you say and when. Also, there is no accountability with the drivers, so the job is babysitting and preaching policies because it's rare that management actually enforces them. However, objectively no company is perfect because people aren't perfect.
Long-Time Employees in Management - Most of the upper management is stagnant and a good majority of the logistics staff is over the age of 55, so I don't personally see a lot of innovation or growth. They talk a big talk about wanting to grow and change and be inclusive, but their actions say otherwise. Office Culture - You genuinely have to watch what you say around people (especially in the bigger hubs). It's gossip-heavy and there's always a brown-noser willing to run to the supervisors with any negative tidbit they can. There are a few acceptions to the rule, but I'd make sure you know your coworker pretty well before talking about anything. Communication - Each department (Logistics, Sales/Commercial, Patient Services, etc) acts like it's the most taboo thing to communicate beyond the bounds of their ""own people"". The same can be said about the different Logistics hubs as well. There's a lot of division and very limited camaraderie - but it's what they can get away with, so it won't change until management does. Poor Raises - Don't expect more than a $0.50/hr raise each year. They do percentage-based raises, and I've never seen anyone get more than 4% - and that's with a ranking of ""Exceeds Expectations"". Annual Bonus - It's taxed to hell and back. I only kept 60% of what they gave me. So if you're expecting a $1000 bonus, it's really only going to be about $600 when the government is done. I wish they'd just give a better raise instead.
1. Challenging Situations: Dealing with stressed or frustrated customers can be emotionally taxing. 2. Workload Pressures: During peak times, the workload can be demanding, requiring multitasking and time management. 3. Shift Work: Some positions may require working in shifts, including evenings, weekends, and holidays. 4. Technical Complexity: Handling medical queries may involve navigating complex technical information. 5. Performance Metrics: Customer service reps may face pressure to meet performance targets, like call times and customer satisfaction scores.
The company has made so many changes and not for the better. They recently implemented appointments only at all of their PSCs and they rolled this out without notice to the employees of when it was going to change that way we could've at least notified the patients and the doctors that send their patients to us. This as you can guess has caused patients to get confused and upset since for many many years quest took both appointments and walk ins. The company was pretty okay back then but as of late it just seems like they only care about the bottom line
Terrible culture of patriarchy and tenure that extends into HR. the only folks that thrive are the 15-20+ yr tenured folks as they would be too expensive to let go. leadership is steeped in yesterdays passive work and resist change and innovation; Quest is exhibit A where plenty of incompetent men are in leadership roles, get hired with zero experience and and continue to get promoted with a thriving boys club. Top down culture hence there is group think in all areas. Not an innovative , future driven organization that will transform in any way with changing times. Terrible IT infrastructure and not set up for any kind of transformation let alone digital / cloud/ AI continue with the same test volume mentality and refuse to innovate and offer new solutions to customers core health systems business churn
Labs DO NOT function well, turnaround time issues in advanced testing are a nightmare. No standardization across the company. Sales expectations are set without consideration for lab issues, lack of lab staff and 2-3X the expected Turnaround times for specimens. Also, base pay for specialty reps is typically $15-60K under industry standard.
Nurses are rude and yell a lot
benefits could be more inclusive
Took their hiring process 3 months to finish hiring me and get me into their onboarding. They should have had me there a month before a new training class started, to gain background knowledge on their software and specimens. Terrible onboarding program , especially if you are going to train others. Specimens processing system has many exceptions to memorize & lack of innovation to solve their own problems. Outdated training materials by 10 years Compliance is out of date Training materials missing many examples and images of specimens received 70% of business is done on Night Shift, but your managers won’t be there to answer questions Asking questions about metrics and performance will see you marked as a “troublemaker.” New positions barely recognized Lack of retention for employees Managers want robots that do not question about metrics, performance, pay, bonuses, AIP. Basically don’t ask questions. This flies in the face of their “corporate values” of “seeking to understand.” You’ll process for hours, only to be told that what you processed isn’t counted toward your numbers. Managers are lax on updating SOP info which will mean you get different SOP info due to word of mouth Basically, if you manage people, you aren’t expected to work nights much, which leaves a power vacuum during heavy processing times. Supervisors that are there are just about useless.
benefits could be more inclusive
Starting pay is low, extra work with no additional pay
Heavy workload, would like to see more compensation for the amount of work we do.
The work environment varies by department and is a full reflection of who your direct manager is. Often time there is NO training on how to manage people and the team suffers for it. High deductible health insurance is available.
They will always pay external hires more than an internal promotion, which is insane. This forces talent out the door just to get a raise. High tolerance for poor performers. Quest seems to pride themselves on employee longevity, but if you met some of these very tenured workers, you'd see that they're still employed here because they're unhireable anywhere else.
Move slowly on giving employees an opportunity for upwards career mobilization.
At least where I live, you can be making the same and often more money at fast food or retail companies, so the pay wasn't great. However raises were decently frequent A lot of pressure to have patient satisfaction, which is hard in a job where you're literally hurting and poking people with needles Easy to feel unappreciated by the company. I had an amazing manager, but I knew plenty of people who didn't
Stressful People are worn out Staff are not happy
Work overload to push out work and will work you like a robot. Micromanagement of workload. If you’re done they will overload you with more work even if your shift is supposed to end. If I could give a negative one star I would. They also have a high turnover rate because there is no work life balance . Do not work as a processor if you want a normal 9-5.

The pay is okay but not the greatest compared to other labs I was employed by. The raises are not fantastic and could be a lot better due to the high expectations put on staff.
The supervisor can either help the team grow or not. If you don't have a good supervisor...many employees call out. That makes for a long day.

This department is bad. There wasn’t a day that I didn’t wish I could quit. You can be the best employee and work your butt off to have great metrics and they will still question why you on ACW for 3-4 minutes. Supervisor does nothing but talking nonsense to keep you calm. Shuts you off when questioning something she doesn’t like. And let not even talk about their “peak season” where you HAVE to work their crazy OT hours. They don’t care about your family, nor your personal life. Work their outrageous OT hours and move on.

Not a lot of investment in employees.
Between the layoffs, hostile coworkers, and HR-nightmare management.. I don't know what's the worst. There is no loyalty for years of service as a FT employee here. They are creating a contract workforce, making sure everyone is expendable. Chaos and drama all the time with the work. Never know if I'll have a job tomorrow.

Very tight knit. Everyone is family due to bonuses given for referrals. Promotions & bonuses are given not on merit but popularity.
Departments are somewhat silohed and have opportunity to collaborate more
On call policy is not good
Lack of shifts in the microbiology department which means you work an average of 10-15 hours a day and if you don’t you get in trouble. Management makes rules from their offices and based those rules on things they did when they were lab assistants 100 years ago thinking that the same rules apply today. All you hear is “no over time” “make sure you clock out for lunch” but at the same time we are short 5 people and doing double/triple the work, which means over time is inevitable. People call out every other day, turn over rate is high, in my 2 and a half years of working in the micro department I’ve seen close to 20-25 people quit and it all circle back to one thing, management.
The only bad thing about this company is everyone loves it so much no one really leaves so it doesn’t leave much room to move up.
There were none at the time I worked there.
Management need more education in how to treat their employees.
Poor management Micromanagement in wrong areas Accusations Co-workers with attitude issues No advancement opportunities Supervisors not helpful

.50 cent increase per year - low pay - CEO and stock oriented -
Favoritism, under paid, disorganized, overworked, no employee appreciation , no work-life balance
does not value long term employees- people just starting out in the profession are in some cases making more than people that have been with the company for 15+ years doing the same job or even less. Upper management talks about how tight the budget is to the employees and then touts how great the profits are to Wallstreet. Constantly increasing responsibilities of front line workers and methodology of processes while no increase in pay. Constant changes that are poorly thought out- Didn't work the first time but let's try it again.
They make you work holidays and you don't get time and a half for working on a holiday as you may expect. Management shows favoritism towards selected individuals and they make it VERY obvious. The yearly salary raise is ridiculous. They have the nerve to give hourly employees less than $1/hr raise in a year which is outrageous considering current inflation rates. You're gonna be working with old pipettes and half broken equipment. Management makes no effort to replace day to day items that are essential to your job. You dont get paid maternity leave. You get 2 months off and if you want to get paid you have to use PTO and/or short term disability which is 60% of your pay(SUCH A JOKE). Management is against employees moving from department to department.

great environment and colleagues, learn a lot
I absolutely loved the atmosphere
The new Science and Engineering Complex is a modern building with great amenities and ample room.
Harvard cares for its team.
The best thing about working at Harvard is the array of free resources, such as tuition to the Extension School, use of the library system, and use of learning platforms such as O'Reilly and LinkedIn Learning. That said, a minority of employees make use of these resources, which is sad because salaries and benefits are sub-par and because you'd think there would be more interest in growth and learning!

Working environment, Pay on time, Benefits
","place is a little too far and need to be in office.
As a university, they value academic degrees, so it can be difficult to advance to without a master's degree or better.
Moderate pay and hard to transfer jobs internal
Not enough money to be paid
Low salary and limited growth potential, unless you are tenure-track faculty
High expectations, many overhead directors and managers
Postdoc salary is generally low, in particular in a city like Boston.
Cambridge is not a fun town
Lot of tasks to handle at once sometimes
Not a place if compensation is your main driver
Short staffed nursing support - can be chaotic
Inconsistent application of remote work approaches.
relatively small, may not have enough people to talk to
Poor treatment of unionized workers
It's a huge bureaucracy which can be frustrating. They squawk a lot about how much they care about their employees but it's just like any other huge company. Don't expect that endowment to bleed one straw penny to save anyone's job in an economic downturn. Don't expect to get credit for anything you do if a faculty person is even vaguely related to it.
The culture was terrible and difficult
Bad, horrible, long hours, low pay, mean students
- Salary as a PhD student is low for Cambridge living standards
Consensus driven culture which means decisions/approvals can take a while
None that I can think of, other than pay can be kind of low.
Not for a full-time job.
slow work for workers who like to be busy
Very decentralized institution (makes connections with peers difficult) Finance/HR may send you a PDF instead of answering your question about policies and procedures, which feels impersonal Bureaucracy
Toxic culture (depending on lab/department)
i have to graduate at some point
Short staffed nursing support - can be chaotic
Downtime can be boring sometimes.

There aren't any -- great digital and actual collaboration
The culture was terrible and difficult
No cons occur to me
Not a ton of upward mobility (without going back to school for another degree) although likely depends on exact position.
No complaints about Harvard. It’s a great place to be.
Salaries could be more generous.
Decentralized organizational structure makes it hard to know what other departments and offices are doing and challenging to connect with other colleagues outside your unit. Bureaucracy makes it hard to accomplish critical tasks in a reasonable timeframe. Organizational culture sometimes results in imposing top-down initiatives without engaging frontline key stakeholders. Lack of clear advancement pathways for people who want to develop in their career but aren't interested in being a manager.
While working at Harvard Library comes with many benefits, it's important to consider potential challenges as well. Here are five potential cons of working at Harvard Library: High Workload: Due to the library's prestigious status and the extensive academic community it serves, the workload at Harvard Library can be demanding. Employees may experience high expectations and tight deadlines, which can lead to increased stress and pressure. Competitive Environment: Harvard University attracts top talent, which means working at Harvard Library can be competitive. There may be intense competition for positions and advancement opportunities, requiring employees to consistently demonstrate exceptional performance to stand out. Limited Work-Life Balance: The demanding nature of the job and high expectations may result in limited work-life balance for some employees. Long working hours, tight schedules, and a culture of academic excellence may require significant dedication and sacrifice outside of regular working hours. Complex Bureaucracy: Large institutions like Harvard University often have complex administrative structures and bureaucratic processes. Navigating these systems and protocols can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming, potentially impacting efficiency and decision-making. Limited Funding and Resources: While Harvard Library offers extensive resources, securing funding and resources for specific projects or initiatives may pose challenges. Limited budgets and resource allocation may impact the ability to pursue certain initiatives or acquire additional resources, potentially affecting the scope of work and opportunities for innovation.
High turnover, as the school goes through a transition.
weather is terrible in winter
There were not really any.

weather is terrible in winter
There were not really any.
Of course, we're in Cambridge, a small town in New England, and the ""city"" and weather is as you'd expect from that.
Harvard can improve the diversity of its staff.
Employees are not valued for work product or effort as much as the willingness to say yes to their manager and to keep their opinions to themselves. Those in positions of authority who take on tasks no one else wants, find a way to make themselves indispensable and thereby are allowed to create toxic environments for those in lower positions. Neither department leadership nor HR will stand against those problematic managers, as it's simply a numbers game and they are considered more valuable than the individual contributors.
high rent and living costs
Experience differs from manager to manager
Not for a long-term career development
Administrative procedures are slow to change or resolve. Sometimes, other colleagues will try to delegate to work, overstepping authority boundaries.
No downsides for working here
There were no cons at work
The administration could be more organized.
Salary is too low (15.50 p/hour) even for trainers (16.50 p/hour) No benefits whatsoever Not challenging
- Late nights unloading trucks
Can easily stay in the same position for years without movement.
often working long hours and weekends
Very high cost of living in the Boston/Cambridge area. Harvard is slow to raise salaries to match inflation.

None! Great place to work!
They don't truly care about your growth
Pay varies several dollars/hour depending on position
Pay is capped, steep learning curve
The busiest times for grading coincide with your own exams
It is hard to learn lab's machine
Manageable scope of work, sometimes quite narrow and dry.
Salary, not dream job, pay for parking
My current department is amazing, but my first department was an absolute nightmare of a job. Current department, would give 5 stars+++ if I could: Respective and collegial culture among faculty, staff, and students Supportive, flexible manager who is extremely good at her job Very low turnover Hybrid work environment with a flexible schedule and good work life balance Very organized and well run, job duties make sense, coworkers who are always willing to help Previous department, worst job of my decade in higher education: Abusive, incompetent manager who had HR complaints filed against them by the previous two employees in my position, and by me! Extremely disorganized Mandatory overtime happening constantly due to last minute deadlines and daily crises cause by poor leadership Very high turnover, which resulted in very controlling managers who wouldn't give any opportunities for growth or development and coworkers who were burnt out and had no interest in training or collaboration since everyone was trying to leave Insistence that we be in-person all the time just to be ""on call"" I could go on My advice is to not ignore red flags in your interview process. There were many in my previous position and I ignored them because of the Harvard name. Be very proactive in networking and finding good schools/departments within the university. There are certain schools and departments that are notorious for having high turnover and low employee satisfaction. There are also lovely departments. It's very hard to get into good department because the staff will stay forever, but it's worth holding out for one of those positions.
The administrative burden is completely out of control. Doing anything at all means you need the approval of a half dozen people. I think this comes from Harvard’s extreme risk aversion. They’re very into their prestige to the point that they fear any risk that could conceivably make them look bad. And so for them the default is always the status quo.
No concrete remote work policy
The pay is not great
Ridden with a student body declining in mental health and a lack of pay to keep up with inflation
The higher up in the chain the greater the politics.
Laughable pay, joke insurance, no recourse for abusive professors. I have been sexually harassed, talked down to, and forced to stay a year longer than I needed because chauvinist men didn't take me seriously. Most Ph.D. students I know take second jobs to make ends meet.
- Late nights unloading trucks
Noah Hulbert is the is an incompetent manager who will squeeze his employees and focuses on the wrong metrics. No empathy whatsoever.

University can feel very big that certain issues get stuck
academia politics; can be hard to advance because people stay for years (in itself usually a positive)
There are not that many tutoring opportunities
Cleaning for a living bit grim
- Lack of professionalism on management - Growth potential is low or non existent
I interned during the summer, a time in which most environmentalists/biologists are out collecting field data so the office was a little lonely!
It is hard to learn lab's machine
Manageable scope of work, sometimes quite narrow and dry.
I can't think of any, to be honest...

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kraft-Heinz-Company-Reviews-E1026712.htm,"From plant/manufacturing operations teams to corporate headquarters, I have never experienced such incredible and humbling people in my entire career. I have worked for small/privately owned companies in various industries but Kraft Heinz welcomes the true meaning of inclusivity and belonging without the the typical ""Corporate America"" feels.
The pay the hours and the hours!!!
Most of my colleagues and people I've met at Kraft Heinz are kind, brilliant, hardworking, and committed. People value learning and teaching, respecting people of all levels asking questions in meetings. I've been gifted phenomenal ownership over my work and projects from my managers, far beyond the scope and trust I expected for this stage of my career. I've found people put as much or as little effort into their role as they choose; the company allows them to receive credit and project ownership tied to their specific level of ambition. The culture is amazing and psychologically safe on most teams, and our Business Resource Groups host great educational, networking, and career-development events.
Professional but fun staff, good room for growth
The base pay and bonus structure is good. Corporate office building is nice.
Benefits, ease of working remotely
Proximity to Lake Macatawa & Kollin Park
Great place to grow career Rewards individuals with strong results Opportunity for advancement
If you’re accustomed to rapid change and agility is a word that doesn’t make you sweat, this place is for you. Not for faint of heart. Will definitely accelerate your growth path if you’re willing to accept the fast pace nature of business. Great bonus structure and pay. Will be a powerhouse in the next decade, but not there yet
Great friendly environment Bonuses possible Monthly Townhalls - able to voice concerns and learn more about the company and it’s future Great supervisors Incentives to succeed Great Benefits Free items for employees
Working at Kraft Heinz will open doors to so many opportunities. Once you succeed in one role, the company will support you in moving around the organization to gain a breadth of skills. The pay and benefits are solid. The leaders in accounting are excellent - care about their people. Overall, this company is filled with smart, success people who aren’t afraid of a challenge.

Very fast paced. Very lean environment. Good compensation if looking at total comp, but bonus is dependent on everybody above you and around you. You can hit all your goals but they will decrease based on whether your manager or pod hits them. Trusts you to get up to speed as fast as possible.

","Not a Con but something that is a priority we are working on - continuing to expand our community engagement within all our manufacturing plants!
The hours and the hours and the hours!!!
Leadership only last year started intentionally removing bureaucracy from decision-making and monthly reviews; we are actively working to spend more of our business hours thinking forward strategically based on past learnings, instead of spending time analyzing new data and trends. (We are making progress; many pointless meetings have been removed or severely altered, and leadership is asking every level to simplify their own schedules and routines.)
Manufacturing plant so there was pressure to perform everyday
No annual increases, hide behind a meritocracy saying the raises should mean more when you actually get one , the raise is market at best for what an annual increase should be. Horrible and I mean horrible toxicity, many times I was either in the bathroom or rounding a corner only to hear HR speaking poorly out in the open about people. Constant road blocking and no support from department where their job is to support. Not consistent in their practices and promote based off politics not merit which contradicts the values they have in place. RUN don’t go here it’s not worth the toll it will take on you and your family.
Ready for more challenges, professionally
Managing predominantly non-English-speaking union employees (all instructions to be made multilingual after acquiring union steward approval and difficult to hold them accountable when they fail to follow instructions. Many claim they can’t read English or Spanish.) Building is falling apart. Process is disgusting.
Disjointed initiatives Lack of communication Lack of transparency
Change is tiring. Work life balance isn’t great. Management is in constant rotation.
Language barrier - forced to speak Spanish even with supervisors Various random shutdowns Tools are old and do not work very well
C-suite leadership communication at times lacks transparency.
Long hours Stand on your feet 12 hours
Constantly hiring people from foreign speaking areas like American Samoa, etc...some cant speak a lick of English so communication breakdowns are common with a lot of employees. Forced OT...will move you through training whether you're ready or not because they're severely understaffed yet the production goals remain the same.
Got forced to work overtime.
Some people don’t pull their weight and leave it up to others
None that I can think of.
-not a lot of opportunity for movement from some roles
No days off they want you to work 80 hours a week
Management and leadership seems grabby at the next big thing, but to be fair that’s with every big enterprise. Lots of foreign workers. Makes it extremely difficult to communicate and regroup. Transformation is still ongoing for them, and i assume it’s going to continue rapidly with a scorched earth path. Everything is Agile. Literally everything. A scrum ceremony in your sleep. Tech stack is not going to help your career.
slow transformation is some areas
None that I can think of.
-not a lot of opportunity for movement from some roles
there are so many people working here it takes 5-6 weeks to get a decision made because 30 people need to be briefed beforehand
Dishonest employer, incompetent management and HR, scheduling issues, and their policies. I was harassed by 5 different people there and I'm LGBTQ+. I did not feel safe there. Kraft Heinz made it very clear they will do nothing to keep me safe. They will fire all that were involved or assumed were involved instead of taking accountability. HR is not your friend and will trick and lie to you or have a nasty attitude. If you're sick they will find ways to get rid of you or make impossible requests like making fake documents from the Doctor. It's all ethically and morally wrong. I stood up for myself and others and now I'm fired. Their cheese wasn't worth the turmoil.
slow transformation is some areas
There are a lot of changes going on at Kraft Heinz. If you are looking for stability this is not the place for you. I worked for Kraft Heinz for 6 months. When I was hired, I was asked to relocate to the opposite side of the country for the job. Kraft Heinz was very generous with the relocation. I started the job remotely until I could complete the relocation which I was required to complete by July. There was a complete reorg of the IT department a few months after I started resulting in me losing all my direct reports. I was then told I could not backfill any of the positions with US employees. My new hires had to be either from Canada or Europe. At about the same time as the reorg, my wife and I sold our house and prepared for the move. The very day the moving truck pulled away with our household possessions, my manager informed me that I had been terminated. I had to make several requests to HR before they would provide me with my personnel file. When I received it, there was no indication that I did anything to deserve termination. It only included an Excel spreadsheet with my start date and termination date, and my resume. They provided no severence. In addition, they threatended to make me pay for the relocation if I did not sign off on the termination relieving them from legal action which I refused to do. To add insult to injury, they tried to deny my unemployment benefits. When the unemployment agency pressed them for evidence that I was terminated for cause, they refused to provide anything. Essentially, they left me high and dry in a new city with no income
Lots of turn-over. Benefits could be better. Disorganized and disjointed leadership. Growing way too fast for the infrastructure, systems and out dated systems. More interested in acquiring new talent than cultivating and appreciating the talent they have.
Can not think of anything.
Career growth complex Very political
During my time, top-tier management was generally very chaotic, with last-minute deadlines often being dictated, lots of shake-ups and restructuring of the company at the top level. The company did start seriously addressing these during the end of my time there.
Horrible Management, attempt to set you up for failure, too much drama and pedophiles. Sexual harrassment.
Hard and dirty work environment
There are extreme temperatures in some areas.
there are so many people working here it takes 5-6 weeks to get a decision made because 30 people need to be briefed beforehand
Staffing can be problematic and onboarding feels extended.
Dishonest employer, incompetent management and HR, scheduling issues, and their policies. I was harassed by 5 different people there and I'm LGBTQ+. I did not feel safe there.

It only included an Excel spreadsheet with my start date and termination date, and my resume. They provided no severence. In addition, they threatended to make me pay for the relocation if I did not sign off on the termination relieving them from legal action which I refused to do. To add insult to injury, they tried to deny my unemployment benefits. When the unemployment agency pressed them for evidence that I was terminated for cause, they refused to provide anything. Essentially, they left me high and dry in a new city with no income
Everything is very slow, In regards to approvals for getting bumped up
Sometimes we had issues with the equipment
Lots of turn-over. Benefits could be better. Disorganized and disjointed leadership. Growing way too fast for the infrastructure, systems and out dated systems. More interested in acquiring new talent than cultivating and appreciating the talent they have.
Long hours Hybrid work environment Corporate
Work / life balance is often unpredictable
Overtime was frequent especially for low seniority
i have nothing bad to say
The company is too lean on employees and turnover is high. Positions stay unfilled for months or years. 3G has decimated the once excellent company with no regard for its employees.
Very corporate Highly regulated Distant corporate
- Still bureaucratic to some extent - Need to support employee growth within the company by moving them around before they leave the company
HR is not friendly towards its workers in any regards. When given warnings or write ups there is no explanation or conversation just a statement and given a paper to sign, if you do not agree supervisor makes you sign it before getting a chance to talk to HR about issue. If refusal to sign worker can be sent home pending investigation of insubordination. If planning to Transfer to another plant ask about the plant policy. They are not the same. Workers have transferred to other plants only to be fired due to not meeting new plants policy such as attendance. One plant policy could be no more than 8 missed days in a year while others are 12.
- Leave open positions vacant for months to years (literally), requiring employees to cover for multiple jobs at a time - Cannot be promoted in-role; requires you to switch positions, which leads to poor information sharing and negatively impacts supplier relationships - Frequent re-orgs - Some departments get way more funding and resources than others
Not as much support from senior leaders
Typical big corporation down sides
overload nice place to start with good people
Leadership repeats the same mistakes every 1-2 years in a constant cycle. Bonus structure can be upwards of 20-30% of yearly salary based on company/personal performance, but targets are ""set"" in a way to ensure that never comes to complete fruition. ZERO investment in employee training, new employees are expected to learn on the job in an extremely fast paced environment.
burn out, turnover, change in management
The pay is low, and you have very little control of your schedule.
work-life balance not so great
Huge company, so it is very corporatized and difficult to climb the ladder quickly
Incompetent and hostile management, terrible work culture, mandatory overtime, poor compensation.
Salary could have been adjusted to cost of living
Gets boring fast in the office repetitive things
Career Advancement at all levels
Management did not want to fix anything. If you brought up any concern they made you the problem. Unwilling to help or protect staff no matter the hazard. Unsafe and hostile work environment. Quantity not quality. More product out the door meant more money in their product. Looked out for the bottom line instead of food and personnel safety.
Going home at the end of the day sucked. I wish I could make the sauce instead of sleeping. The sauce is so much more useful to the human body than sleep. I got a better gig working as a neurosurgeon instead but I always keep sauce handy before and after my operations.
No work life balance, boring and repetitive work.
Still a bit bureaucratic and not a great spot for high performers to excel.
Low budget for research, small research teams that are spread thin, minimal focus and long term strategy.
Interview process is long and a few rounds.
For some functions work-life balance may not be ideal
No training, expected to do way more then operate machine that is supposed to be a 2 man job. Bern doing it by myself for over 5 months. As well as the other extra stuff I do. No extra pay or even a raise. Work 10hr shifts been when it comes to holidays I only get paid 8hrs but when I want to use pto I have to use 10hrs to cover my shift. Zero communication from hr to management. Your responsible for making sure when your sick someone uses your pto. Even though no one told you or showed you how when hired. Otherwise you won't get paid and also get pointed for missing those days. There is zero accountability in this plant. Pay is terrible for what is expected from a operator. Their whole system is set up for their employees to fail.
No work life balance Poor management Poor culture
Huge company, so it is very corporatized and difficult to climb the ladder quickly

Gets boring fast in the office repetitive things
Department management is incompetent and dishonest. Higher management is only interested in dollars. Human Resources are non-existent for employees as HR caters to management. Hours are horrible in many departments employees work 6 days a week sometimes 7 depending on the position including ALL weekends while Department management is 7-3 Monday thru Friday. Training is abysmal. They will not allow proper maintenance of equipment to control cost instead of replacing worn parts with new they try to refurbish old parts or cannibalize equipment in storage to save money. Promotion is only for those who know somebody. Qualifications mean nothing.

Still a bit bureaucratic and not a great spot for high performers to excel.
Low budget for research, small research teams that are spread thin, minimal focus and long term strategy.
Frequent Re-orgs. No loyalty to long time employees. Poor structure around bonus reporting. Targets are not usually finalized until mid way through the year and results reporting is usually behind. For most of the year you do not have an accurate understanding of how you are performing against your bonus metrics. Bonus structure can create silos and conflict among different groups.
Interview process is long and a few rounds.
70+ Hour work weeks 6-7 day work weeks (they tell you that it's once a month but that's a complete lie), no support or help, no training, morale is (understandably) very low, management never shows any appreciation/only care about production numbers and staying within budget, and no respect at all. You have to provide your own tools. I interviewed and got hired as a ""tech 1"" at ~$27.80/hour, first pay check was around $26.40, go to HR department and got told ""no that's correct, here's your position and pay scale"" (which wasn't ""tech 1). Never got trainers pay even though I trained 3 other techs for 3-5 months until they all quit. Shift pay difference is a whopping 0.40/hour. Just plain ridiculous in every single way.
For some functions work-life balance may not be ideal
Abusive workplace that is not transparent and won’t even tell you what your job description in New responsibilities keep being added Highest turnover including C-suite that I’ve ever seen, you can check stats They pretend to be very open minded and pro whatever the liberal topic of the month is but when it’s the time to show it they will not live up to the standard. For example: preach support for mental health then employee requests help and gets the opposite They are embracing the “agile” mentality/work style, which is leading to employees having to be always ON and the work is a bunch of ad hoc with very minimal guidance and a bunch of ambiguity Be prepared for daily and constant micro aggressions. If female, be prepared for mansplaining Unorganized and chaotic People leave and processes need to be re-designed because nobody knows what it was supposed to be done Managers are a bunch of teenagers so be prepared for that too At its core, it is a very sexist workplace hiding behind a rainbow flag
Work life balance have to work long hours
Low salary that was unexpected
Beurocracy can be limiting to innovation
Less fine place to work could use some improvement
Lack of connection from hourly to office personnel. Work/life balance struggles.
Management changes often. Hours can change over night.
a mess and would never go back
a mess and would never go back
Pressure with Zbb Lack of growth in the brands Not merge with big players reduce the velocity of growth. Products are not healthy. Became a cash cow company without big perspectives
Lots of meetings. Big company, so difficult at times to understand all roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders. Alignment can be a challenge.
-Business is selling off brands to pay of debt, constant layoffs and business reports -No work life balance, people will try to message you via teams at insane hours of the night. PTO is a joke as the company culture expects you to be present -compay turnover is unreal, there will never be a time where you will do your job and your job alone -Merit is a joke and highly under the radar. Expect a 3% merit after a couple of years to make up for cost of living. This is only given out to a slim amount of employees - Undervalued from Leadership - Reported racial discrimination to HR and nothing was done. That employee left the company due to that -Men were widely known to make more than women employees -HR is a joke at khc and did nothing to solve any of the above issues
A lot of internal rotation across desks and high turnover can lead to inefficiencies.
Long hours Seasonal The Heat Favoritism The pay
Cold weather can be tough
Long hours average 12 hrs shifts 6 to 7 days a week. No work life balance.
Management will throw you to the wolves to save themselves
Work Overload Obnoxious Peers Unsafe work environment Untrustworthy peers Contact you on your days off Poor diversity

The people you work with that aren't management/supervisors. You will like shopping there when your not working as it is more affordable then competing hardware stores
There is no good reason to work for this company.

Menards is a place where people come to improve their homes and build additions that their friends and family will relish for decades to come. I enjoy working in Building Materials/Millwork because it gives me the opportunity to use my skills of sales and communication to best help customers get the products they need. The workplace culture is also fun and fast paced with great people helping each other out.

Good training system able to pick up quickly
This company does a really good job of being competitive with their pay. They offer an extra 3 dollars and hour if you work weekends. Furthermore, I would consider it pretty easy to learn and are offered chances for advancement.

When I first started it was during COVID, after COVID they let us keep our pay. Very easy work for a decent amount. Mostly friendly staff.
They gave us ample breaks. Training went well and they would save face if you messed up by talking to you one on one. We would be given a lot of store credit if we weren't tardy and could use it on store goods. Sometimes management switched up our roles if it wasn't so busy so we could learn new skill or take a break from cashiering.
Pay, benefits, work-life balance, bonuses
Part-time and some full-time position schedules can be flexible. Weekend pay is an extra $3.00 per hour.

meet nice people every day and interact learn different random things you wouldnt know before working there

Set schedule and work in mornings.
Good training system able to pick up quickly
works with schedule and has flexibility
Decent, if not slightly below average pay. On Thursdays there's a guy that will play music in the cafeteria.
Really easy hiring process. Easy to communicate
","- Rude customers (rarely) - Gossip
> Certain levels of communication through lower management could be improved, but this is getting better. > Needs more Maintenance Team Members on hand - understaffed. > You have to use your badge to receive employee discounts AND the amount is deducted from your next check. Why not just allow the store to scan your badge - verify it's active - and receive the 10% discount and pay via the Team Member's choice of payment method? (suggest a higher discounts too? - 15%)?
Can be exhausting There's a lot to learn
Did not receive information on retirement savings match
Depending on the season, you could become stressed over the abundance of work
Late hours on school nights
I do not have any problems at Menards
Long hours as a manager. Weekend work.
Inconsistent schedule makes planning things hard
Upper management was stubborn - up to and including opening the store in a blizzard and -40F windchills. Extremely mistrusting of employees - having your lunch box searched before being allowed to leave was demeaning.
Too many protocols and set procedures
Not a lot of benefit options for part-time Can be a little overwhelming at first depending on background
I spend way too much money there
Hours got cut quite a bit due to it being a slow time of the year
Weekend work can get annoying when you have things to do
Looooong hours, sometime up to 16 hours.
Having to work weekends sometimes
Don't get hurt here. They will fight on everything, if you have a lost time accident like I did, then don't expect to go back because they will ask for a resignation. I fell and dislocated my shoulder which resulted in a torn rotator cuff. They denied my rotator cuff and I had to fight with them and workers comp to prove my injury to the rotator cuff was from the dislocation. They will use doctors that agree with them to be able to deny a part of the claim. When I got hurt they took away any bonuses that was owed to me because I was just shy of my sign on bonus by a few weeks.
-Can get very boring from doing the same tasks -Not as flexible for full-time -Hit or miss on management
There really aren’t many cons that I can list
Long hours MT program does not do much training, your more of a worker then a manager in training Benefits are not great
Not much chance for growth
It’s Menards. It’s not a dream job
Kind of boring at times, little room for advancement
-Required open availability -Stores are short staffed -Payroll can have massive negative impact on hours available -Open most holidays -Must work weekends
Don’t work too hard, they will take advantage of you. 3 years and I’ve seen 10 department managers: all have quit without working out their 2 or were fired. I work more days as closing manager than I don’t, despite not accepting a manager position nor receiving manager pay. If you want to keep your sanity, stay out of management here. No benefits for part timers accept a very expensive dental plan. Depending on the store, they can be very lenient about attendance as long as you have an acceptable reason (and sometimes proof). also Clopening shifts should not be allowed. Even with the new schedule system, it happens. That right there is probably the top reason why management leaves so often.
different hours. not much advance opportunities
Few cons, just sometimes busy
the salary is rather low
Employee discount can only be offered in the form of payroll deduct and your paychecks are small because they pay weekly.
bad management, bad organization to work for
Management is rough, points system is silly, schedules are 3 weeks out
Not much chance for growth
management seems to get away with a lot more than just a regular employee. lots of guest issues without management backing you. drama lots of it if you do not sell you're constantly ""talked"" to
overworked and underpaid. You are just a replaceable cog in the big machine.
not flexible managers not amazing
Finding quality team members, pay, hours expected to work, close-opens, typical high school level drama like most retail settings, rampant corporate level ignorance
They are not flexible and do not work well with employees that are college students
It’s Menards. It’s not a dream job
The micromanagement...thats says plenty...will watch you like a hawk, Roaming down aisles lurking to make sure your not doing something as simple as talking WHILE your working...they don't like that an you will be reprimanded. That store (Livonia, MI) is often the hardest hit store as far as customer volume an the management doesn't appreciate their employees despite this. They care more about the numbers an not the employees keeping their ""numbers"" high. Constant work overload of pallets/heavy lifting. They will make you run register even if it's not your department or initially what you were highered in to do so.
The health insurance benefits are some of the worst in the world. There is no 401K match. The hours are terrible. Want to work a 12 HR shift followed by a 10 HR shift with less than 6-7 HRS of sleep in between? Work for Menards! This company is pure trash and is run by a paranoic schioprenic. Stay far away.
Some department managers are creepy, the pay is sad, customers love to yell at you sometimes.
They do not care about your safety multiple ramshackle rolling ladders, uneven floor in the garden center makes that especially dangerous Multiple times over the couple years I worked there I was asked to lift heavy heavy things up those ladders with little to no safety precautions Management only cares about themselves and is mostly just old white dudes despite qualified hardworking alternatives If you are considering working here, do not go into hardware, it is the miscellaneous bin of Menards and you will find yourself being spread thin and walking miles upon miles everyday as someone out in garden center needs help but then someone over by screws needs help And you have to rush there because they're working with a skeleton crew and the customers are rarely patient. All this is to say this place is kind of a revolving door, you'll get a few people that stick around But if you stay there for longer than 6 months to a year you are likely to have a completely different group of people you're working with. Expect to be working full time while also not being marked as full-time. You also don't get holiday pay unless you have worked there full-time for a full year. So even if you work there full-time if you haven't been there a year you're out of luck.
Horrible salary increases are almost non existent
-Required open availability -Stores are short staffed -Payroll can have massive negative impact on hours available -Open most holidays -Must work weekends
Management was not always the nicest
3:30 - 4 am wake-up time to be to work by 5 am comes early... hahaha! I knew that when I signed on. The option of going FT was available, but the benefits are pretty poor. FT pay was only $1.50 more per hour than the base PT pay. Livable wage in NE is around $27/hr. and base pay for FT was offered at $17.50/hr.
different hours. not much advance opportunities
Few cons, just sometimes busy
Have to work every other weekend
Hours, can be stressful at times,
Nasty customers, but that comes with working retail,
No face piercings or colored hair

Retail is hard and Menards has high expectations.
Some department managers are creepy, the pay is sad, customers love to yell at you sometimes.
Management gets treated poorly sometimes
Their employee discount gets deducted directly off of your paycheck whereas other employees allow you to just receive a certain percentage off while still allowing you to pay as you please. Lastly, if you have an open availability you can get stuck closing frequently which usually involves staying 30 minutes past store close but this is common with retail jobs.
Work environment sucks very badly
No work to do, no work
Some department managers aren’t super helpful
Management- they’re not good unfortunately. This seems to be a retail theme as well.
Pay was not the greatest
Terrible hours and pay roll. Management will pass a lot on you Very fast passed can get stressful at times
very high turnover OVER 80%
People on their phones too much
Hours, can be stressful at times,
Nasty customers, but that comes with working retail,
This location had poor management and communication.
No face piercings or colored hair
Strikes. I was able to avoid getting a lot, but as an employee you may have to worry about these hanging over your head. Management sometimes wasn't the friendliest. I had one manager get upset I wouldn't be coming in despite suddenly falling ill. Some customers were patronizing or a bit unfriendly. It was rough standing on your feet all day (weren't allowed to sit).
Their aren't any cons I can think of
Perception, perception, perception. Once something is perceived about you it is carried on from store to store. Gossip is so damning and depending on management they retaliate (though it is illegal). They play with policies to their benefit. It can be a toxic environment.
Hard to get a lot of overtime.
Employees burn out when resources are unavailable to help customers to the best of our ability.
You do not get a consistent schedule
The workplace politics pissed me off, unless you kissed the GMs @$$ you wouldn't be getting any promotion or anything like that even if youre an amazing worker
Management in the department was severely lacking. Customers were incredibly rude and were the worst part of the job.
trucks come past closing time that were required to break down
Very fast paced environment and long hours
Retail is hard and Menards has high expectations.
Manager wasn’t always understanding that school comes first
Too many managers. Too much standing around and talking.
Management gets treated poorly sometimes
not always a fast paced environment
If you are looking for stability and security, this is not the company for you. This company has no issues with walking you out for doing your job with zero notice. I had only received positive feedback about my work up until I was called into a meeting at the end of a work day and told I wasn't a good fit. There was absolutely zero warning my work wasn't meeting standards. In fact, I had been received multiple emails remarking on the high quality of my work provided. When I questioned what exactly about my work wasn't meeting the standards, zero information was given and I was met with a blank looks from both my previous manager and the HR representative present while reiterated the same line as before, a simple not meeting standards, The only thing I can think of that lead to this was me doing my job, as per my contract to provide effective copy and voicing my concern with the a format we were over using. During my short stay with this company I witnessed entire teams being walked out the week before bonus's were supposed to come out with as little notice as I received. The insurance the company provides may only be described as expensive dog water. There is zero mental health coverage as well as a high price tag for minimal coverage.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Memorial-Sloan-Kettering-Cancer-Center-Reviews-E4711.htm,"Here's my honest opinion...I've worked in the UES location for almost 4 years. I love the location and the people I work with. My manager is great and she is fair. She always pushes you to do better and cares. Because of her I was able to return to school and pursue my degree. The tuition reimbursement is great, the benefits are phenomenal, the 401k plan is pretty good too. The overtime is unlimited when there is a need. I've worked at both Koch and the main campus and all I can say is that the people here are good and they care. Even under stressful situations we usually come together and make things work. I truly can't see myself working anywhere else. I love providing quality care to my patients because that's what they deserve. When patients come here they know that they are in good hands. We all make sure of it. I am so fortunate to be here.
+ working on unique projects + being involved in one of the large financial drivers of the institution + meeting a wide range of patients and caregivers
The colleagues that I worked with really care about what they do. Personal experience with managers have all been positive. Personally, had lots of autonomy and little to no micromanagement. Senior management seems to care about feedback, inclusion and fairness.
Compassionate clinical practice Strong intellectual clinical environment
Great place to work with good colleagues and very helpful people who are invested in your growth. Overall excellent place for career development with lot of resources for your benefit. If you put in the hard work, you can get involved in some of the newest cancer research projects.
Starting pay tends to be more competitive than other New York City hospitals. Great health insurance, generous $12K tuition reimbursement, and good 401k match plan. Some jobs have remote flexibility. Fantastic mission and very smart people to work with.
Very Great care for patients
really great place to work
Great environment. Lots of people working there for decades. One of the best places in the field.
It's nice and the hospital is as good as it gets.
Good pay and overall benefits (retirement, disability, medical/dental, etc.). Yearly bonus for having certifications or Masters Degree. Yearly pay raises and market adjustments every few years.
Work is very straight forward
MSK has great benefits. They have 20 days of vacation and great healthcare benefits as well. You can work a hybrid schedule, 2 or 3 days are onsite depending on your role. You can gain a lot of great experience and work on interesting projects if you make the effort to connect with people across the organization. Upward mobility is possible if you are friendly with the right people.

Staff is extremely hard working and truly cares for patients. Great team work!
I genuinely love my job and the clinical teams I work with. I have never woken up and thought ""ugh I have to go to work""
Great place to work, culture is very important here. Current compensation is about 80,000 to 85,000 with overtime which is great to have as an hourly employee. Base would be too low to live here without it. Semi-hybrid model is great for the position.

-Truly amazing co-workers! I cannot emphasize that enough. My entire team (Radiation) from MDs, RNs, Care Coordinators, Office Coordinators, RT Therapists, and Dosimetrists are brilliant, compassionate, and easy to work with. They are hands down the best thing about this job and it is truly an honor to work with such stellar people. -MSK also has great benefits (although they are slowly taking them away instead of improving them). -Tuition reimbursement at 12,500 is amazing (but was just lowered if you are a new employee and not in a clinical role -- see above). -Nice contribution and company match for retirement - Inexpensive and quality health insurance. -Generous PTO -Lots of room for OT at my site -4 day workweek -MSK name recognition/resume -Working with this patient population, although difficult emotionally at times, is rewarding. It is my main drive to get up and come in every day because I truly care and want to make a difference. The same can be said for my coworkers who have expressed similar feelings.

The main and only pro for the job is that you will be remote. However that comes with no stipend for WFH setup costs. To the managers who are willing to work alongside growing analyst are incredibly helpful. However, if that work is outside your direct manager it is very likely your efforts will not be heard.
- worked with compassionate and hard working colleagues. - affordable health insurance and medical care. - brand value. - being able to help others
Research here is top notch - so many different trials, departments and people you will get to work with as well as various platforms. Great place to learn more and develop your skills if you are interested in clinical research. Compared to other hospitals, MSK pays very well.

1. The work I do matters, and influences peoples lives for good. 2. I know I am paid more than similar roles in most other hospitals in my area. 3. There is a big emphasis on retirement benefits, retirement matching, pretax spending. There are also people available to help you make the best financial decisions for your planned future.

Great work-life balance Opportunities to grow
-Good name -insurance -tuition -fixed shift -weekends off
Great Work Life Balance culture
Colleagues are nice, and the environment is good
Making a difference, great co workers and OT opportunities
Great place to work for
Depending on your clinical team, you can work with some of the most amazing doctors and nurses. Patients can be wonderful to speak to and you feel fulfilled when helping them coordinate their care. The benefits are great as well!
Good research being performed, a lot of access to state-of-the-art equipment which is not available at institutions with less money. Looks good on your resume. People are always impressed you worked there.
a lot of clinical trials are going on here
- very inclusive - growth opportunities - welcoming
Great company to work for to fight against cancer
3-4 % increase each year.
Nice work culture, good work life balance
Get to work with top-notch vendors and systems
get to participate in surgeries seldom seen anyplace else in the world
-Good name -insurance -tuition -fixed shift -weekends off
Great Work Life Balance culture
Great place to work for
good benefits, all remote office
a lot of clinical trials are going on here
Being able to interact with patients and their families is definitely the highlight. You develop a rapport with so many amazing people and it really brightens your day. As you progress to becoming a Care Coordinator II, you get the added bonus of developing a rapport with clinical staff based on where you're placed.
Good pay and benefits. Also, good flexibility being a remote position.
3-4 % increase each year.
Overall great institution to be at.
Pretty well staffed compared to other hospitals
great benefits - health insurance, coupons
GREAT benefits! GREAT people. Some departments are a little more extensive on the workload compared to others, but considering how the workforce is now after the pandemic, most places suck and are severely understaffed. With this considered, I still think MSKCC is a great place to work. I'm fortunate enough to work with people that actually CARE to make a difference for all of our cancer patients. I've been here 3 years now and counting - can't be that bad, huh?
Great connections can be found if you seek them out
Good Benefits Good career support Supportive HR
Cool PIs and innovative research
Very clear clinical ladder, highly competent peers, endless professional challenges and intellectual stimulation.
Benefits Good working environment High salary Good staff in the department
There is possibility of growth in this company and leadership is hands on.
","None that I can think of....This is a great place to work for and yes people have left to go to other hospitals, thinking the grass would be greener on the other side. One thing I will say is that no hospital in NYC tops Memorial Sloan Kettering, so when people leave they eventually come back because of the family dynamic we have here.
+ department can be chaotic +leadership is a revolving door
Hard to move up/grow for certain roles.
Administrative environment was less than stellar, too much competition, too many egos with hidden low self esteem, sort of like Wolf Hall.
Long working hours but it depends on what you do and not strict
Pay increases aren't performance-based unless your manager really goes to bat for you. You'll likely get a standard cost of living raise every year. I also never received any type of bonus for ""exceeding expectations"". While there is a good process in place for employees to apply to internal positions, salary for these internal transfers are not handled appropriately. Rather than getting paid the appropriate value of the new role, HR tends to base your new compensation as a percentage increase (usually no more than 10%) of your current role.
Overworked, underpaid, feels lonely at the top
No downsides to working at MSK
Not many chances of growing if you don't have a MD.
Everything can always improve and such.
Difficulty advancing as a Nurse, near impossible demands to do so. The system that’s used sets one up for failure, and it’s unfair and biased. Upper management makes unit based decisions without Nurse input, placing Nurses and patients at risk. MSK is a business, and like any business money is the key factor. Forcing Nurses to work in an environment without proper training or support (ex: adult to peds) and completely ignoring the Nurses concerns. Nurse Educators are never around, or don’t know what they’re teaching. Management is not supportive, or non existent, and belittles the staff for having concerns that can affect one’s license, as well as constant micromanagement when they do come around. Understaffed, overbooked, and constantly rushed to get patients in chairs and treated. Office coordinators and their manager make the rules, not Nursing. Was once a great place to work, but constant changes to policies, rules, etc.; and lack of Nurse support has created a toxic environment and extremely low morale causing Nurses to leave. Staff Nurses are made to be charge, or responsible for scheduling and if you’re not part of their clique you are penalized with heavier workloads, and a horrible schedule. Preferential treatment is given to certain Nurses, while others are left to pick up the slack.
Pay could be a lot better
If you are good at your job, you will be asked to do the work of 2-3 people without any extra pay. Lower level employees are eligible for bonuses if they work on special projects or take on extra work, but they don't tell you that you are. Raises are very small, even if you get a promotion, the raise will usually be 3% or less. Lower level employees are eligible for bonuses if they work on special projects or take on extra work, but they don't tell you that you are.
Not many chances of growing if you don't have a MD.

cold environment, difficult middle management
No cons off the top of my head, but not much growth in this field overall unless you're intending to be a supervisor or manager.
Management treats you with no respect. Watch how they mistreat workers that are non white. The nurse treat and talk to them like dogs. Witness a worker getting reprimanded for using the bathroom. Prisoners have better treatment than these folks.
**This is specifically for department of surgery at MSKCC*** It will be your downfall if you have zero healthcare experience. No room for mistakes/errors/growth. Someone I trained was fired 3 days shy of completing her 6 months probation. Whatever you do if you apply for this position - stay FAR AWAY from the dept of surgery, go to medicine. A job that can be done 100% remote but insist and require staff to sit in cubicle 3 days onsite (not patient + rarely see your MDs and clinical team). Zero flexibility with that, would rather have you call out than let you work remotely to keep the office staffed and not having other OCs covering 2-3 MD offices. TOXIC work culture, passive aggressive upper management. Management will immediately throw staff under bus. If a doctor unprofessionally yells at you and it was escalated to management… management laughs it off and doesn’t do anything about it. Lots of hyper fixation on mistakes, mass influx of anxiety, etc. Blackout dates for taking time off, your PTO will be rejected if your coverage partners can’t cover. For your mental health DO NOT WORK AS AN OC.
Not much opportunities to grow
No cons really. So far happy.
creative, good team work, high-paced
terrible hours (12 hr shift), terrible management, disorganized, awful pay
Corporate politics for advancement. Reduction to tuition reimbursement.
None I can think of that would be significant. Sometimes favoritism.
ORPA RFM's are extremely overworked and there is a really high turnover rate.
Working extra hours often to provide the best car for our patients
The patients are sicker and the acuity is high
I would consider this position ""boot camp"" for healthcare administration. It requires expertise of all administrative positions and departments within the facility. It is a very challenging work environment mainly due limited staffing, resulting in employee burn out and frequent call outs.
Management promotes people who kiss up versus people who are proven competent and passionate about the work they do. We are short staffed and overworked, just because we can single-handedly handle chaos doesn't mean we should have to.
The pay is very low for NYC. Not sure how anyone making less than 90,000 here can afford to live alone in Manhattan unless commuting more than an hour away from NJ or Long Island/CT. Or shelling out half of income towards rent. The opportunities to apply internally are limited when there is always shortstaffing within one's department.
The pay is decent but not for living in NYC
Management treats you with no respect. Watch how they mistreat workers that are non white. The nurse treat and talk to them like dogs. Witness a worker getting reprimanded for using the bathroom. Prisoners have better treatment than these folks.
No longer have pension plans
Certain departments are short staffed, so you may be asked to do overtime for coverage

-MANAGEMENT, BURNOUT & UNDERSTAFFED. -This looks to be a theme after reading other reviews and is clearly something MSK needs to improve but hasn't. -Even our managers are overworked and jumping ship because upper administration doesn't give them the tools to succeed. -Staff aren't replaced when people quit. -Staff that work hard are rewarded with more work. -Feel unappreciated and like your voice isn't heard. -Involuntary OT because of the high workload and expectation of when work should be completed. (I probably do about 6 hours of OT in just staying late to finish my work per week-- which should have been the workload for 2 people). -Turnover in ALL departments at my site is honestly insane. I have been there for over 2 years and the amount of people that have come and gone is horrendous and MSK should be ashamed. -The burnout has reached such an all-time high that we've even had meetings to discuss this (which I appreciated). Managers have tried to improve it but are limited in what they can do with the resources they are provided. -The MDs are also burned out and are given more patients than any doctor can handle. MSK is not supporting them which ultimately impacts patient care. A few have expressed to our team that they are miserable and that ""this job will kill them"" so to speak because of the constant stress 24/7. Our site has lost amazing MDs left and right because of their treatment at MSK and it is a huge shame. We have the best minds in oncology working here and MSK administration can't bother to make changes to retain them. -The stress, workload, and burnout are so high that many of my coworkers have cried. THAT IS NOT OKAY. -Pay is competitive for my role nationally, but very underpaid for the NY metro area. Pay us a living wage! -No bonuses -Lots of PTO but forget getting to actually use it unless you put in for it 6+ months in advance. CCs at our site are only allowed to have 3 people off at a time. -No teambuilding, socialization, or outings organized for my site individually other than a holiday party (eg. summer bbq, team lunches, happy hour, potlucks, clubs, etc.). We don't even get snacks at our monthly team meeting which is pretty commonplace at most companies. It's work, go home, rinse and repeat.

Management is by far the worst I have experienced in years with little to no guidance on expectations and roll responsibilities. My direct manager was rarely open for questions and when my questions were received they were used against me as bait for poor performance - ""inability to work without direct information."" With no information and only an end goal in the harsh political environment of the company how does one expect a decent job. For any analyst, expect to go out of your way for information in-order to go around your boss as analysts aren't expected to utilize the direct managers. The mind set of the team is figure it out yourself or you'll look bad but senior analyst and managers are not willing to help in the process. To that point, it is not a job for free thinking and growth oriented analyst. Look somewhere else for a job. Lastly, the company terrible financial performance is hidden by the gross amount of direct free funding from the government. You'll have no pay increase during your time and no bonuses. The expected time from analyst to analyst 2 is 3 years. There are 4 levels of analyst till you get to senior analyst. At that rate you'll be ~35 till you can make >100,000. GL
- low compensation. Not a live-able wage for a single person in NYC living in their own. - organization is not interested in retaining employees. - Clinical Staff i.e. MDs are not courteous and treat admin staff like servants. - management tends to guilt people for using PTO and ESTA time. Management also denies use of both due to inadequate coverage. - lack of communication between different services. - avoid expecting admin staff to do the jobs of other services such as transport.
While the pay is good, expect to be working overtime and expect to feel guilty for your other colleagues when you take off from work. The position is very demanding as you'll be responsible for many patients and their care under research (think of patient's appointments, enrollment on trial, their treatment and compliance). Along with that, you'll also be primary contact for the protocols you are assigned to and required to meet the demands of the investigators and leadership. The work volume can definitely be overwhelming, especially if your department is disorganized and/or if your managers do not provide you support which I found in my case.

Pay could be better for the amount of work
-complicated cases -they dont give 12 hour shifts -micro management -unfair sick pay policy -unfair overtime policy
Comp is high for NYC Healthcare, but low for Tech in general
The manager is crazy and critical
Poor management. Lack of recognition.
Great staff and crew to work with
Beware management (depending on your department). It is clear management does not care about their employees. They will drive away their best employees by rewarding good work with more work. They rather have a few good employees pick up the slack, rather than re-train/replace lazy staff. It is common to be in double coverage for several months at a time, and when you ask for an incentive, don't expect to hear back. Expect to work several hours of overtime, and don't expect to feel appreciated when you go above and beyond. Office coordinators should be compensated much more than they currently are.
Salary - $82,000 a year. Enough to live in NYC, but you cant enjoy living in NYC. Most of your salary goes to mandatory expenses like rent, utilities, and public transit. Postdocs have access to subsidized housing, but it's still hard to make ends meet. This causes stress and makes you come to work tired or with a bad attitude because you cant enjoy yourself outside of work. Work-life Balance - non-existent. As a researcher, I was expected to work and answer emails while on vacation. This expectation was not expressed to me during the interview process at all. All while giving 110% and working more than 7.5 hours a day and weekends. I would expect that the 2 weeks a year I have to myself I truly had to myself. Management/Senior Management - they are researchers who were promoted and do not have good empathy or people skills. It's all about the bottom line to them. I was treated like a commodity that had to produce continuously, even when exceeding the productivity of the previous year.
low salary compared to other industries.
- low pay - management is not the best
very heavy work load for care coordinators
No complaints at the moment.
No cons as of now
Extremely siloed, ultra political, poor consideration for the development of direct reports), fear-based management approach, guarded with big-picture, long-term organizational / departmental goals and vision.
poor morale in the Main OR. there were a lot of problems when i worked there several years ago. things could have changed by now, i know there's new leadership, but nonetheless. it was toxic and there is no room for growth as a CST. whether you're a CST I or III, there is no difference except for pay.
-complicated cases -they dont give 12 hour shifts -micro management -unfair sick pay policy -unfair overtime policy
Comp is high for NYC Healthcare, but low for Tech in general
Great staff and crew to work with
dense hierarchy, slow decision making
low salary compared to other industries.
This position is very taxing - mentally, emotionally, and physically. The hours are long - you definitely feel every minute of your shifts. Work tasks aren't difficult but the volume and expected turnaround time are major contributors to stress. The constant cycle of long days and a high volume of work catch up to you fairly quickly once you're out of the training/mentorship period. High turnover is very representative of this.
High turnover rate and a lack of strong comprehensive training upfront led to stress and taking on more work than can handle as the job progressed.
No complaints at the moment.
Housing policy for postdoctoral fellows is limited to three years.
MSKCC is a non union facility.
hiring freeze - they promised me a promotion and it never happened
Since the pandemic - most hospitals have been understaffed, and we're no different. I think most of us are burnt out or at least starting to experience it, but truthfully, I'm not sure if it's MSKCC's own fault entirely. It's just the workforce all around.
None that I can think of
Very minimal supervision in day to day activities, you have to be a self starter to get ahead and put yourself out there.
lower pay, heavy workload, not much flexibility
Space is limited; sometimes you have to work in clusters and tune out what's going on around you.
All is good. Be kind and treat people with respect.
Sitting all day on a computer doing daily tasks can be tedious.

If you're into being part of the Defense-Industrial Complex, have a military family/enjoy the culture or want a security clearance and Pentagon access, this would be a great job for you. This is a true 9-5, with near-infinite job security, and the people tend to be decent, especially mid-level managers. Raises are guaranteed annually and the healthcare is great (though as a young person this is mostly irrelevant). Hybrid work is also very much a possibility and the hardware they give you is decent.

","Promotions not as fast as you would like
There was no cons with this job.
Limited promotion opportunities in same department
Have to be flexible and work under constant changes.
- travel and separation can be difficult on families, kids - possibility of mortal danger
Government pay is not as competitive as industry
This job is boring as hell. No other way to put it. The work is mind-numbing, though thankfully there isn't usually a heavy workload. Prepare for utterly pointless, frequent meetings. Prepare to deal with frustrating bureaucracy/laughably outdated software/constant network and software issues, and frequent pointless training. Prepare for mega-boomers to be your colleagues, with a few youthful exceptions. Don't expect anything to move fast. Don't expect to be fulfilled. This is not the job for creative types, highly ambitious types, or altruistic types. Though it's easy work if you went to a good college, be warned.
Not the pay you want.
Some bad folks that you can’t get away from
This is a scholarship-for-service program meaning that every year that a scholar receives funding from the program must be paid back as a DoD employee, and summer months are counted as 0.5 years. E.g., a Ph.D. completed from Aug 2019 to Aug 2023 will require 4.5 years of service as a federal employee.
Travel away from family is hard.
There is quite a bit of burn out and upper management is not alway the most understanding or available to staff.
Long work days can sometimes lead to burnout
Workload stress constant meetings and status updates
Requires frequent moves, difficult for families.
Training or the lack thereof
Won't get rich on a govt salary
Low Base salary, red-tape and office politics in some places, not always working on cutting edge tech stacks.
Advancements are based on likability & who you know, not your capability
Despite being remote for years due to the pandemic they refuse any flexibility in remote work after the pandemic despite the same issues still existing

Low Base salary, red-tape and office politics in some places, not always working on cutting edge tech stacks.
Regardless if your performance is better than most expect a 3 on your annual appraisal. The same as the person who did the bare minimum to be employed. While management has captains rating captains that are also close friends. Giving each other all 5s to get bonuses. If you are a regular employee don’t ever expect a bonus. Without asking you they just give everyone 16 hours of compensation time (1 day 4 hrs) to use. If you are looking for this job I would highly recommend a location other than Savannah, GA
getting shot in the face; prescriptive wardrobe; some yelling; lack of geographic stability; failure to align advancement with performance for anyone but the top 1%
Pay suffers a loss because of the pros listed above
Pay has not increased with inflation
Only mental health professional on-site. Remote supervision from DoD. Overcomplicated administrative processes. Not suited for providers with less than 5 years of experience. Must be self-directed.
Must be dual status Military
Bureaucracy, lack of accountability sometimes, lack of mobility,
Federal health insurance is expensive
I really didn’t have any cons
No cons at the moment
Most of the time you must relocate for advancement opportunities
Long hours Management varies wildly
Long Hours and relocation required frequently
Pay not appropriately tied to performance
One has to work through A LOT of bureaucracy for everything. It makes it difficult to get anything done. Also, a significant portion (about 25%) of the workforce are lazy, passive aggressive boomers who complain about everything, wont do anything, and blame everyone else when something goes sideways.
Advancement is largely based on time in service. No financial incentive to be a top-performer.
Not many data science experts, so work is very much self-directed (you need to self-teach)
Bad leadership and work load are not worth the terrible pay.
Does not compete well with private sector on salaries. Can be slowed by bureaucracy. Pay increases have increased time wise
Private sector pays much better
No problems. No issues. No problems. No issues. Why ask
Move every couple years, never off the clock, individual experiences obviously differ, but it can often times be very very stressful. A lot of intangible sacrifice.
Hard to find meaningful work in the federal sector
No agency in schedule, deployed often
Some federal government mandates Social engineering
Nothing to complain of yet
The pay cant compete with the private sector.

No Cons at all. Many opportunities
Limited freedom of movement and ability to choose location.
Pay has not increased with inflation
Management needs to learn how to be actual managers. Favoritism shouldn't be a part of the equation.
Not all employees held to same standards
Long hours and varying shifts
The political environment can be overwhelming and ethically draining at times. Rank and position title often outweigh logic and ideas from those in a non-leadership (title) position. It can be draining to try and get those higher up to see and do the right thing. Because impact and meaning is so important, if you do become constantly undermined because of a non-leader position title, it can become frustrating very quickly.
Must have a military background to understand the conversations
Management is slow to address pressing concerns that are raised if it ever gets done at all.
Inflexible work schedule. Difficult to make changes
Moving, time away from family
exhausting work, in elements, hot/cold
Government red tape and bureaucracy impede efficient operations.
Rigid military environment and policies
Deployments working hours schedules time way from home censorship
As many other organizations experience, organizational cultural can be resistant to change. Innovative and transformative paths can experience resistance.
Government work can be slow
Politics almost always get in the way of completing you job
A lot of people dislike the bureaucracy and how slow moving things can be, but I find DOD better at this than other agencies despite how large it is.

Work life balance can be difficult to achieve
Low pay, slow moving at times
None none none none none
I did not have a lot of time on the job, we are a Military family, and the Government said it was time for us to move to the next location.
Government shut downs and threats of downsizing
Travel and safety expertise needed.
There are virtually no cons.
Long work hours and deployments
Transitioning to civilian life and workspace may not meet expectations.
working with the military , there are a lot of leadership coming and going.
You feel like you’re wasting away mentally.
The DoD is deep and wide, and if you’re not careful, you could find yourself roaming around in the dark.
Online Human Resources, all documents online.
Some people are entitled and forget how difficult it is for others to obtain a position in the government
Office politics was unbelievable. To many playing the system and everyone else having to pick up the slack

Good wlb depends on team though You’ll get to work on interesting projects
Amazon, and especially AWS, is a training ground for smart, execution-oriented, hard-working tech professionals. The company emphasizes delivering constant results, thinking big, and a hierarchical culture, so it may not be for everyone. But for those who are driven, you will grow immensely. One especially salient and unique pro of working at Amazon is the ability to grow your career into different directions that you could never imagine. At most tech companies, you're hired to do your job well. At Amazon, succeeding in one role or team means most other teams will take a chance on you. This is particularly valuable in the early and mid-stages of your career.
I know this depends on the team so this might not apply to every part of AWS so take this with a grain of salt, I will just talk about my division. I have received lots of help from current coworkers as well as previous ones (the ones I met during my internship). While managers are very busy, so far they have never denied a time to meet me and guide me. In my division and team people work hard but only their hours which is something that I really love because I don’t bring work to home. I definitely feel welcomed here and I am very thankful because they gave me my first job opportunity.
At AWS, you will end up working so much that there won't be any dearth to learning. Depends how much you want to make your work part of your life.
Ability to own a huge scope. Room to innovate if you take and/or demand it. Lots of opportunities to hone your business writing skills.
-Endless opportunities for growth given the scale of the company -No one tells you that you can't work on a project -There is always hiring to do (which is great as a recruiter) -You're able to be a true partner to Hiring Manager's and the business as long as you stand up for yourself and have manager support -There is an endless amount of problems to solve. Most things are figured out, but there is a lot of room for improvement in pockets and some groups lag behind others
It's good for getting your foot in the door/if you are starting in tech. Benefits aren't too bad either. Get your experience and then leave.
Innovative Environment: Working as a scientist at AWS has been a dream come true. The company offers a highly innovative and intellectually stimulating environment that constantly challenges me to push the boundaries of my expertise. Top-Tier Resources: AWS provides unparalleled resources for scientific research, including access to high-performance computing, expansive datasets, and advanced machine learning tools. Impactful Work: The projects I've been involved in have real-world impact, ranging from healthcare to environmental conservation. It's immensely satisfying to know that my work contributes to positive changes globally.
Being part of the leading cloud provider there is an immense sense of pride. The ability to focus on helping the customer achieve their desired business outcomes and have everyone pulling for our customer's success is amazing. Leadership Principles (LPs) are real. The culture is peculiar and I enjoy that.

I have learned so much at AWS, from replicating issues to placing together different cloud puzzles. - work hours are decent -lots of benefits (medical, dental etc) - great people
Work Culture Ease of onboarding Team initiative Opportunity to learn and grow Help from team Good pay
Weekly Check and taking off early if you want only within your granted hours limit. That's it.
Easier to get into at for entry-level IT professionals
This company prefers to hire internally, so once you are in, it is easier to move to different roles and further your career. But this can highly depend on your manager. If they are good managers they would help you move to the next step in your career. You get to work with some of the most brilliant people in the world and work on some of the coolest, most innovative and new technologies. It pays well (this can depend on the current economy situation, your manager, and overall team).
I enjoy what I do I am continuously learning new things The pay

The work is interesting and teammates are intelligent.
Good Team, Good people and culture

Amazon provides a great learning environment and a lot of space for growth especially for interacting with AWS services themselves as well as new and upcoming technologies.
Great money and great hours
- Culture is great - people take the time to help you - Will gain a lot of experience - Opportunities for growth
-Once you have AWS on your resume it will open some doors for you. -It is a very thorough onboarding process, but is also a bit like joining a cult with the emphasis placed on Jeff Besos being a genius and the ""leadership principles"" -You will meet some very smart people. The solutions engineers are great and want to help you succeed.
You get to contribute to changing the way AWS operates and provide a great experiences for the customer. Seeing real time impact to what you do which changes the way teh AWS looks and operates is very rewarding
Great place to learn how be a leader. Everyone is so willing to help and there is never a ""not my job"" attitude.
get to learn a lot technology wise and leadership wise
The pay is really good along with the medical benefits. Some individual contributors can find a way to just build their own project. If you can swing this you may have a good time.

Depending on your teammates, and especially your manager, you might grow substantially in your career. Be ready to work hard, and know that the wrong leadership chain or immediate manager can mean that even good performance won't be able to keep you here.
Smart people, best cloud services, solid insurance
They offer good training for cloud support roles.

They believe in their leadership principles Cool, innovative technology Surrounded by smart people Once in, job mobility
Nowhere is perfect, but here is as close as I've seen. Your career is what you make it and AWS is a great place to make it great. You have to be self-driven, but it doesn't really matter, that's the case no matter where you are since you're the only one who knows what you want & need best.
Money for first two years.
Fast-paced environment with lots of flexibility to participate in and own new programs. Great opportunity to learn cutting edge technology.
Technology is generally very good or best in class, still a market leader, tons to learn with new services and features released weekly.
1. Pay is good, especially for someone with instructional design skills. 2. You have all the opportunity in the world to learn and grow within your position, as long as it fits where the company wants to grow. I’ve learned a ton in my time here. 3. Coworkers - my coworkers are some of the best, smartest people I’ve had the pleasure of working with in my career. They’re thoughtful and hardworking, and I happen to be on a team where everyone helps each other. (I know this isn’t the case with all teams though.)
was a good place...things have changed in 2023.
- Company provides ongoing training program - Customer centric - Strong management and leadership - Remote working option - Competitive salaries and great medical benefits
I was not there very long, but the amount of knowledge I gained was unbelievable. No college education can compare to the value of learning I received.
Compensation is very competitive. Buildings are nice.
Top of the line products, great pay, people
I work with some of the smartest people I've ever met. The work itself is engaging and fun.
Nice vibe with the right org
You're open to talk to anyone in the company at any given time to ask for help, and you're encouraged to pivot to any other team internally to help projects you're more interested in. The pay is great as well and you work with incredibly smart people that will help you grow and learn if you seek out that type of help. I often asked pulled in people to help with wok-related projects and was often was asked to help out and there's a great sense of a community!
Really good life-work balance. Good development
You are surrounded by driven and knowledgeable people in the industry within just about every business vertical and technology niche. For most people, employment here represents a career launching pad.
Night shift is good for people who have kids. They have 4 hr shifts which i like with the oppurtunity to pick up extra shifts.
Crisp docs and tough feedback that improves your communications over time, People care about outcomes and support you do your best work. The problems are big and the culture gives the opportunity to confront adversity, escalate when necessary, and practice diplomacy and negotiation. Writing is central to the approach of working at AWS, so this is a fantastic opportunity to hone your skills in that regard.
AWS is an industry leader and there are a lot of opportunities to work with cool tech
You are always exposed to cutting edge cloud technologies. Amazon brand name. AWS is a cloud leader with faster pace of innovation, at least for now. You are always operating at a large scale with a level of complexity that helps you build your professional experience.
Lots of opportunities to learn.
The pay is very goodnl here
The job is very easy and repetitive
Lot of opportunities to learn and innovate, hard work to support customers and build something new!

Good people generally to work with. Supportive teams, if you are lucky
An opportunity to work with some of the brightest and most influential engineers in my field. The company has scale that is hard to fathom and decisions you make can impact millions of users and billions of servers. They are a growth oriented company and put pressure on me as a leader to develop my ICs and provide them career advancement.
Providing good money and signing bonus
You learn a lot, and work next to highly intelligent people. There is room to grow skill wise and you can also move around the company to other positions. The work pace and decision-making rate of speed forces you to adopt a new type of working speed as well. Room to fail but keep on succeeding as long as you learn from it. Flexibility on hours for certain positions as long as you get your job done at the end of the day.
Work with some of the smartest people. Good quality of work and great exposure
Working at Amazon Web Services raises the caliber of your personal business acumen because of the high bar Amazon holds. Diving deep into analytics is easy because of the vast resources at your disposal.

Good pay, good benefits, smart coworkers
I work with some of the smartest people I've ever met. The work itself is engaging and fun.
Working with incredible, smart, and often caring people.
","Company is difficult to navigate due to size. Teams are silo’s which sometimes leads to duplication of work.
Company is too big and sometime its difficult to understand what’s priority for the leadership.
Classic things about big tech. -things can move slowly (lots of process and approvals required when you're operating at this scale) -very hierarchical culture -certain managers or teams can be toxic (avoid them) -following the Amazon playbook can sometimes become cultish and discourage independent thinking, especially with managers/teams that aren't the highest quality -pay used to be slightly lower than other big tech, but I believe this has changed in the past couple years
I don’t see this being mentioned in public too often and I think it should draw the attention of some people. At Amazon engineering does own their products completely, which also means you have to be oncall one week every 2-3 months (that means 24/7 pending for any problems arising from them) depending on your team size. I personally don’t have a problem with this, but a lot do so I put it here, but now you are required to come 3 times a week to the office.
1. Writing, writing and writing - Employees just write all the time and then the papers go to dust! 2. Weird calls!! If its a 30 minute call, people spend 20 minutes in reading through the document and 5 min for discussion and 5 minutes for next steps. is 5 min of discussion enough? Moreover, there is culture of providing weird and stupid feedback on documents. Amazon expects everyone to be a writer! If I were to become one then why would I write documents, i will write books and be happy! 3. Too many Indians in tech staff and they are always trying to please American bosses through Weekly, Monthly and Quarterly Business Reviews. 4. No work life balance, you will end up doing 2 people jobs or even more. 5. Those who say that AWS pays well, don't know what industry standards are. Salary is definitely low. 6. Employees have a habit of using Leadership Principles (LPs) in every day conversation and they don't mean it! They just use them to make others feel how much they value the LPs 7. AWS Leaders always want to go to events and make great announcements and don't care about the staff who has to work 70+ hours a week to make things happen 8. Managers save all travel opportunities for themselves and their directs never get opportunity to attend any of the shiny events. and I have more but you get the point i guess!
- Sycophantic employees mean innovation can only come if politics are in your favor - Work hours are 60+ every week; no time for skills development - Only able to prioritize health if you land a good manager. The other 75% will have you working till 2am and not think twice. - Majority male indians for coworkers who were born, raised and educated in India, resulting in dominant cultural norms being dictated by Indian culture, which for Indian leaders in the US is often arrogant, dismissive, immature, tone deaf and generally lacking in self awareness. Bringing the Amazon workplace vibe to a 1980s US workplace vibe. - Amazon's preference for hiring foreign Indian talent means that US standards are thrown out the window and foreigners workers are held hostage by the Amazon sponsored work visa; ergo you can exploit this talent more than a US born employee. This is a big problem the government needs to crack down on.
-Everything I wrote for the pros might be a thing of the past. I was impacted by lay-offs and all of my friends that remain with the company have no work to do and are in a very toxic environment at the moment -Your manager sort of makes or breaks your experience -You won't always get the help you ask for since everyone is so busy
Working in AWS datacenters can be extremely stressful and not fulfilling. Management is where a lot of the problems stem from in this company. This is a TECH job first and foremost however management doesn't understand that. In certain clusters almost NONE of your managers are former techs which shows you how they are about promoting people from within. They are trying to run datacenters almost like fulfillment centers. They don't understand that the two are completely different. A lot of good techs have left to go to competitors and yet the management sticks around. It's almost like a revolving door for good workers. Come in work hard for your team get denied promotions/raises leave and go somewhere else. There is also a good amount of micro-managing that happens so be prepared for that.
Fast-Paced Environment: The fast-paced nature of AWS can sometimes lead to a demanding workload, which might not be suitable for individuals who prefer a more relaxed pace. Learning Curve: Given the cutting-edge nature of the work, there can be a steep learning curve for newcomers. Adapting to the latest tools and techniques may require extra effort initially.
Wide-sweeping layoffs take a person with decades of experience, that meets/exceeds performance expectations from $400k annually to unemployment of <$300 per week. Everything you've worked for is suddenly gone due to no fault of your own.

The workload can be difficult at times Sometimes it feels like I don’t understand what is going on, can’t help customer Metrics ( can be stressful to let each week)
Deadlines are critical Sometimes hectic Not much benefits All week work from office No free food
You are not listened to as an employee. They put you in a work share system. I did well as a stower and always consistently found myself in the top 10 out of about 180 stowers. The computer game monitor was a competition. So what, I did very well as a stower. The areas I struggled in to make rate was Out-Bound Packing and Inbound Decant. You get a message to report to a department that really isn't your department. I was wrote up 6 times and eventually fired. I was wrote up 5 times in Decant and 1 time in Packing.I knew nothing of my 3rd and 4th write ups until I gotten my 5th write up. I was going to be quitting around the month I was let go. I still made 3 to 4 times the money being self employed so no hard feelings. It's a myth that you can say no if you get a message on the workstation computer monitor to report to a different department. Dreading a department is no excuse! Go or otherwise get wrote up. You are called to a different department every day or night. Traning is really not training at Amazon. After two days you are on your own and accountable. You get wrote up on your first day of being on your own if you don't make the rate. I have to build up speed is no excuse at Amazon. There is no such thing as the speed will come later when you learn the job. You must have the speed now!
Pay range is not quite as high as other positions when considering FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)
Burnout culture is real. The workload is a lot. Sometimes it is too much. It can be a very high-stress, fast-paced environment. AWS is a machine that will keep on taking and taking whatever you give. So it is up to you to draw the line and dictate when you should stop working. Work-life balance is not always great for some people. You may end up working weekends, stressing about work during your vacation, etc. Its not for the weak. It is also not for the long term.
Can be bureaucratic at times
I wish new RSUs would best faster/sooner
Can quickly lose support resources on projects.
pay worse than hedge fund, not competitive enough
No free food Not full remote
Difficulty working from home as there are a lot of internal systems to get used to and ramping up is rather quick.
Work you like a slavr
- Worked long hours - My team specifically was super cheap and rarely splurged on their employees - Org is unorganized
- You are treated as just a number and layoffs are frequent and rampant and they do not look at performance AT ALL. A team member was laid off for performance at 200+ % of goal while a team member at under 70% was kept. - This is a place where they ONLY way to get ahead is nepotism. Good work is not rewarded. You have to play the game with leadership and only get opportunities if you network internally - more than you do with your clients or partners. This may not sound that bad from the outside, but it's a toxic culture unlike any I've ever seen. - Their ""customer first"" leadership principle is a sham - it's ALWAYS AWS first. - The promotion process is absolutely awful, so you better negotiate well before getting in. You have to write a 9-page document tying back your accomplishments with data to a different leadership principle and have senior people at different levels write on your behalf (aka you write it for them like recommendation letters when applying to colleges). Then it goes before a committee and is reviewed by people who may very well not know you at all. And you will only get a promotion when you have proven that you have been performing the work at the level above you for over a year. It's just another way that AWS saves money by exploiting employees.
Most of senior management is an echo chamber of ""yes men/women"" instead of having the engineer in mind along with the customer. Changes implemented seldom will work toward a harmonious work life balance and often will result in over stress and over work of the engineers and mid-low level management. On top of all of that, due to the echo chamber of back patting ""behind the desk"" leadership, policies are put in place to drive pointless metrics instead of focusing on their mission... ""Strive to be the world's best employer"".
Before I started, I did a lot of research and saw many comments about AWS having a PIP (performance improvement program) culture. I had not experienced that personally until about 15 months in. I got a great annual review and consistently get good feedback from my peers. My manager, however, placed me in a coaching program and provided no notice that they had added me to that list of ""under performers."" The reasons provided also didn't seem to match up with the standard other peers who have been promoted were judged against. For AWS to be a data driven company, the data points didn't add up and it seemed like they were raising the bar for my situation but my peers weren't held to the same standard. I won't go into how I found out but had I not known I was in a coaching program, I may have been fired sooner. Knowing I was in a coaching program bought me extra time to look for new jobs and make progress on my coaching plan. Aside from that, the TAM role can be extremely stressful. You're expected to put your customers first AND then with your extra time, if you have any, contribute back to the AWS business. The paging situation depends on your team. For my teams, it worked well.
work life balance is not great and RSU is a big component of total pay
Weak and disorganized leadership. If you are someone who is used to being on a well structured team or organization it can be rough. I would say if you are a veteran especially this can be especially difficult. You will not use industry best practices for anything outside of cloud work. I would strongly avoid Amazon if you are an embedded engineer other than as a short term stop.
its hard to get promoted
Your manager at Amazon is considered a god and infallible. There are no customer reviews and very limited opportunities to showcase your work outside of what your manager wants to show.
I wish new RSUs would best faster/sooner
Can quickly lose support resources on projects.
pay worse than hedge fund, not competitive enough
No free food Not full remote
-You'll be expected to figure just about everything out on your own, from administrative process to training. -Outside of the onboarding process, there doesn't seem to be any sort of formal training or professional development/mentorship program. -Leadership is hyper focus on utilization and overall profitability. All my manager and I discuss is how to increase utilization (billable hours). -""The stock dropped $5...am I getting laid off next?"" is tough to have hanging over your head.
I loved the company, until the CEO went back on their original promise to NOT RTO. The company is currently going back on that decision and everyone hired ""virtual"" will be forced to move to a location or ""voluntarily"" resign.
Relentless management, horrible WLB, crushing stress and pressure, insane onboarding requirements, super competitive environment for promotion, easy to burn out quickly
Difficulty working from home as there are a lot of internal systems to get used to and ramping up is rather quick.
Work you like a slavr
Work you like a slavr
- you are a number; no one cares - you will get stepped on and thrown under the bus at every opportunity possible - burn out is a major understatement. Be prepared for 12+ hour days, everyday
- Worked long hours - My team specifically was super cheap and rarely splurged on their employees - Org is unorganized
Senior leadership is an absolute joke in 2023. Between how they handled layoffs and returning to the office, they have zero trust. Morale has been crushed beyond repair for the vast majority of folks still here.
No cohesion between teams, comp is too reliant on RSU’s, at L7, it’s almost impossible to get to L8
High management turnover created environment of shifting priorities. Supervisors and managers hired with less experience than current subordinates. They prefer high turnover of subordinates to keep wages low vs paying people what they are worth with higher experience. Hiring new employees is delayed which saves the company money, but stretches current employees thin, making everyone work harder for the same pay. Some managers clearly play favorites. Employee loyalty to the company is not reciprocated by the company.
work life balance is not great and RSU is a big component of total pay
The culture can seem culty
Terrible management, no work-life balance. Long vest time for stocks to keep you there. Metrics driven.
Extremely large matrix environment with little support. You are expected to work as an individual contributor although to be successful (e.g. hit quota, goals, and achieve promotions) you will spend a lot of time coaching peers and your team. Do not expect much effort in coaching, or even general insight on best practices from your direct manager or senior management. Feedback from your manager is highly generalized and very sparse only once a year.
its hard to get promoted
1. Leadership is so incredibly tone deaf 2. Leadership doesn’t know what it’s doing 3. Leadership has zero empathy 4. Leadership lies (offered remote role when starting, then was told after a few months I had to go into an office despite being across the country from anyone on my team) 5. Absolute grinder 6. Benefits are non existent other than measly 10% off Amazon *up to $100 total* 7. 401k takes THREE years to vest
Varying levels of understanding of the leadership principles and job levelling Exec Leadership is trending away from the core values that made Amazon Culture is now ""Day 2""
Depends where you're at I'm sure, but there've been a significant amount of re-orgs since I've been here. That amount of churn is never good, but I've come to expect it at any big company. A lot is happening and change is the norm. If you want less change, you are going to have to go work for the gov't or some small well established company.
Everything other than money will destroy you. Do not leave your job if you have a stable good job.
Onboarding process throws people into the deep end, management support is very different based on teams. Frequent reorganizations (I had 5 managers in 18 months and was moved to a job function that didn't match what I applied for). It's very difficult to get a fair performance review when your manager never gets a chance to see what you're capable of.
The unique culture that Amazon prided itself on is largely gone and this is another big tech company. Stea
1. Near-constant reorgs. I’ve been a part of 14 reorgs in just as many months, and they aren’t well thought out or prepared for in advance, and it leads to unnecessary confusion. 2. Lots of leadership turnover. It’s hard to push for a promotion when your manager and skip-level leaders are constantly changing. 3. Lack of training for managers. I used to train leaders in leadership development soft skills and the lack of preparation here is astounding to me. It also shows up when managers have little to no soft skills, and no one is teaching them how…so I do a lot of coaching up. 4. Tough hours. I either have 4 hrs of work per day - or 14. There is no in between - and often those 14hr days come as a result of false urgency. Everything is not an emergency. 5. The doc-writing culture is such a waste of time. It can be beneficial for presenting big ideas, but they take a long time to write and then you present it, get comments, and it dies, never to be seen again. And, for a company that touts never using PPT slides, they use a lot of PPT slides. 6. Favoritism. There isn’t much you can do with this at the lower levels, since it’s perpetuated from the top levels. It determines who gets promotions and whose ideas are listened to. 7. Senior leadership is mega out of touch with its workforce. Unfortunately, they’re the ones making layoff decisions… 8. A culture of competition. This is the thing I hate most about working at AWS. There is a scarcity mindset instead of a growth mindset, and so everyone is competing against each other for resources (rather than working together to present the best possible product for customers). This causes duplication of work ALL THE TIME and a total waste of time and energy. 9. Lack of inclusion for people with disabilities. There’s a lot of lip service to this, but most managers see disabilities as only visible ones. I have several invisible disabilities and I constantly have to advocate for myself when it comes to requesting accommodations- and often the process is so difficult to request them that I (and many other PWDs) are deterred from trying. All in all, I would not recommend AWS to a friend- or if I did, I would share all of this info with them in advance.
Utterly speechless that RTO is forced on employees. Comp is too low.
- They have an extensive interview process
I got laid off and wanted to learn more
Leadership is poor (vision, stratagem). Management is horrible (only care about maximizing output, nothing else). You are treated like you are trying to steal from the company at all times. Amazon owns you, you are their slave - not exaggerating. Every employee is a mercenary focused on their own compensation. You must pay for everything from parking in Amazon buildings to drinks. Amazon plans to fire 50% of the employees they hire. Performance is extremely competitive and cut throat, and Amazon encourages this. The leadership principles are used at times to make a point, ignored when inconvenient. In my org, they have been weaponized. Professional development is on your own time and own dime.
Aren’t any that I can think of
The oncall schedule has been incredibly stressful for people over the past year.
A lotta work and alot to learn
Your manager is always after metrics and data to flex up to their own manager rather than really pursuing the productivity of its employees. Often when running into issues that hurt productivity that are raised to managers, their response falls back to ""Well this doesn't align with our metrics, so guess we can't do anything!"". Moreover, properly challenging these ideas formally take massive initiatives from team-members which take an insane amount of work, where you might as well just ignore the issue and keep on focusing on actual work. While working I often have to stop myself from thinking ""How am I gonna tick these metrics that will show my manager I'm doing a good job"" rather than genuinely deliver value to the company at your role and it's insanely frustrating.
Have to return to the office now. no other cons inside my team
I was one of the most tenured people in my whole org after 3 years. I had 7 managers in that time who sometimes had up to 30 direct reports. You need to be self driven to progress as even as in early career, you will get no mentorship you don't fight for and your calendar will be filled by other people and teams if you don't relentlessly prioritize.
Really dont have a down side.
The scale of the company makes the job ""dense"" with opportunity but you should regulate work life balance as it is easy to get unbalanced. If you fall in love with the problem, the time involved in each work week goes fast. I work more than 40 hours a week. I have meetings that start at 7am and meetings in the evening on most days (personally I do not mind this). The ability to own and drive products and programs that have wide ranging impact is exciting and harrowing at the same time as risk lurks in many different places. I really enjoy what I do at AWS so I take the ups and downs in stride and focus on making a difference.
Amazon isn't the company it used to be. Pay isn't as competitive as it used to be and the stock has lost a lot of value.
AWS has grown to become $85B run rate business in 2023. This massive growth brings some disadvantages too. Amazon and AWS hired too fast anticipating continued massive growth post COVID pandemic. But, things did not pan out as expected leading to lay offs, over-hiring thus overlapping roles with no clear charter, org politics, empire builders creating roles without clear business case, too many partner and customer facing programs that thoroughly confused employees let alone customers. Hiring bar has fallen to the ground to the point that tenured Amazonians like me who have been put through the Amazon rigor of ""high bar"" wondered how some of the new hires have been hired, from the poor quality of their work/output. AWS has now become an unbearably complex company that is rapidly losing its sheen, decelerating faster and going down into the abyss.
Your manager at Amazon is considered a god and infallible. There are no customer reviews and very limited opportunities to showcase your work outside of what your manager wants to show.
Amazon is not providing societal good
A lot of favoritism with managers
No great vision to help others!
Management can do a little better with assisting

Relentless management, horrible WLB, crushing stress and pressure, insane onboarding requirements, super competitive environment for promotion, easy to burn out quickly
- Boring operational work load was pretty high - Worst benefits in the industry; horrible 401k match that doesn't vest until you reach 3 years at the company - Monthly on-call - Upper management (L8+) changed deadlines a lot - Not a lot of diversity at all, 95% of my coworkers were south asian, - Robotic culture pushed by upper management (Leadership principles are cringe)
No compensation for the work, no bonuses, refresh rates are bad
They make you work a lot
Support structure struggles to keep up; marketing, HR, management, structure, budgeting, finance, programs struggle to keep up--people are taking advantage of the chaos.
- you are a number; no one cares - you will get stepped on and thrown under the bus at every opportunity possible - burn out is a major understatement. Be prepared for 12+ hour days, everyday
there is no cons at all
Long hours, high stress & pressure
- Tight deadlines, can be stressful at times - Not a 9-5, need to constantly be improving or find a new job
Toxic management that doesn't care about you except meeting your deliveries
Amazon is very proud of its peculiar culture and coming from the industry into AWS can be a bit unintuitive. Being older than most of the established norms, Amazon does things their own way and it takes a while to think the way your peers do. Until you do, it's very hard to make any headway or earn the trust of your peers to make proposals or get big projects moving. This is powerful but can cause insular thinking and has led to some teams acquiring massive amounts of tech debt rather than looking to places in the industry who have solved this problem.
Bad work culture. Less Team work work life balance is nearly zero
Pay is not comparable to similar companies. Long hours and very little work life harmony. Leadership is pressured to meet expectations and it often outweigh employee happiness and career development. No time to work on personal goals - long hours, and if working from home there is work consistently throughout the day and night with 15+ hours a day often times. Promotion is difficult and hard to understand how to achieve, even if you're doing the same work as those in the levels above you.
Teams not well managed. Lot of work
Managers are not leaders. In my experience the majority are emotionally immature and create a toxic environment. They are out for their own glory and promotion. I’d recommend planning to work here for no more than 2 years.
I got laid off and wanted to learn more
Aren’t any that I can think of
Lots of stress. Everyone wants to be the best, the most visible, making the biggest impact...Technically you CAN take your own pace at least in my org, but that would risk of being left behind and potential PIP if you are unlucky. In short, if you are a smart, self-driven person seeking a career leap and challenge, this is the place for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
Senior management is extremely short sighted, they don't care about their employees but the short term stock price. They have a list of 12 leadership principals, which the senior leadership follows maybe one of them, and asks everyone else to follow all of them.
The oncall schedule has been incredibly stressful for people over the past year.
Most teams seem to go through many ups and downs in staffing. People leave or are asked to leave and then their open role can't get filled due to hiring restrictions, putting more pressure on the teammates left behind to get all the work done.

stressful management, poor management, does not allow the warehouse to get ahead of schedule so we are always picking and loading for the same day, overtime is continuously denied if they don't like you, if you are slow or you get into a disagreement with a manager they make you casepick for a week or two (because it's physically demanding and painful for most older people), leadership, safety, wait times for trucks, favoritism, no direct HR, no union, hardly any PTO/sick time/vacation time, earning PTO takes too long (working 1 month straight with no call offs won't even earn you a full day off until after your 1st year). You are only provided with 40 hours of 'PTO' to borrow for the whole year, 30 of which are state mandated sick time that you have to earn back for some reason
Mass hiring done within a few hours
a third party logistics provider that despite not having the resources to offer premium salaries and raises; does their best to remain competitive, provide associates with benefits from day one, and actively fosters associate growth and promotion. Their time policy is flexible and goes by the minute allowing for room when life circumstances get in the way and when associates reach a certain point of accrual, are allowed to cash in their unused ""bucket"" hours at a 2-1 ratio once a month.

Get your forklift and go. Work the whole shift on your own. Never hear a peep from management or supervisors unless you're working way to slow. Ridiculously cold in the freezer, but you're never in there too long. Very physically demanding job and monotonous, but the pay was fantastic. Time and a half on your sixth day, double pay on your seventh. My first check was over $1800 take home.

","None till now. You will always find 1 or 2 annoying;
Poor training. Bait and switch hiring, unorganized. Supervisors have no experience with what takes place in the field,nor do they have CDL experience. However they try to tell you how to drive, or how to handle situations that arise in the field. If the computer says it should be done this way than that is the way it should be done. I was super disappointed by the way they treat you, train you. You have two options when they pull the bait and switch job positions. You either work the position that they want you to work, or go find another job. You are paid by the route not by the hour, most of the days are over 10 hour days. You must meet your delivery times, most of the times you return with more freight that You've picked up for returns, than what You've left with. Trucks and equipment are not in good shape, and should be replaced. There are are certain situations where you should be placarding your trailer, but that is just a formality with them, after all, they do require a hazmat endorsement. Huge turnover at the Charlotte facility.
- mediocre management as far as development and overall - strong lack of organization and structure - mediocre pay for the educated candidates - unfair bias and upfront disregard amongst employees of races - an overload of work responsibilities - unfair travel and work conditions - team members and management project a very unhealthy and traditional work-life balance as they accept and live it - very overwhelming at times and may feel unsupported by team and management
They run off of Ford schedule. When they shut down we shut down. The point system favors the people in the office. If we want to get paid for holidays we have to use it out of OUR PTO which we earn every week as vacation time but you can't save up anything because you need to pay yourself on a non working holiday. No bonuses. Haven't even got a raise this year in which we used to every year for at least cist of living.
- On Feet for several hours - Can't use your phone - Uniforms mandatory
Get new management for this warehouse. Period. Hire supervisors that actually know the different job functions, that can actually drive a forklift, that knows how to work the technology that everyone uses. A supervisor that doesn't say ""I don't know"" to EVERY question an employee asks
Never got to start the job that I was employed for. I, along with about 20 others, never got a chance to start working because of an issue they experienced with their contract with ABB.
Being a third party logistics provider, there are no guarantees to associates due to constantly evolving contracts btw site owners and the companies they provide logistics for. Therefore the salaries they offer and yearly raises aren't as much as companies that provide their own logistics. They have recently done away with paid holidays and their new PTO policies leave associates with less paid time off to accrue. Associates with 30 or more years with the company had their vacations they earned reduced drastically as well as amount of PTO they can accrue.
It can be a tough deal to do all of their trainings
Long hours No OT No life outside of work
Limited advancement opportunities. Consistent management.
Salaries are too low for internal promotions. The internal candidates have a much greater opportunity of being successful for the job than someone who is completely new being hired as an external candidate.
Pay should be higher, incentive should be higher.

Peak seasons can be unpredictable, and overtime may be necessary unexpectedly.
No regard for work-life balance. Work 7 days a week, get penalized even if you have an emergency. Make you work holidays and then decide not to pay you overtime for the weekend since they paid you 1.5 for working the holiday. Immature, unprofessional supervisors, favoritism, disrespect, the list goes on. Most people say the reason they stay is because they know it's toxic but they're used to it, and don't want to have to look for something else.
The company culture is extremely toxic. They're always in ""Start Up"" mode and it is likely that you will be expected to work odd hours and weekends in addition to your regular schedule. The turnover is pretty high for the people who have the freedom to leave so heads up. You will learn a lot and get a lot of experience though. Keep the extra hours in mind when negotiating your salary because they will not tell you that part! They also use intimidation tactics to make you feel like you have to do work outside of your job description and work unethical hours. I once had the flu and worked from home for 2 days. When I got back to the office, still sick, I was told that I ""just didnt want to work"" as if 1. I wasnt quite literally working while sick at home and 2. I didnt literally have the flu. The manager who said that to me was out the entire next week because he had caught the flu and infected his whole family.
There is none when the site already has all the standards set
You don't really feel like part of a team
No work life balance. Many long hours
No room for growth. If you want to work for a place where you can just cruise on by and never move up, this is in.
Management doesn't know what they are doing, equipment is dangerous and they don't care
Over all experience is good
Poor management full of guys who failed up in life. No skills, little knowledge of warehousing and no accountability.
Haven’t experienced many to date

bad hours, weird schedule/shift, pay is okay
Peak seasons can be unpredictable, and overtime may be necessary unexpectedly.
Limited customization: DHL Supply Chain's services can be somewhat standardized, which may not work for companies that require a high degree of customization or specialized services.
Work-life balance is a challenge.
Raises does not keep up with inflation Hours can be chaotic Requirements for work vary from site to site leaving some with 50+ hour work weeks
Monotonous! You're not on an assembly line, but you still do the same thing over and over and over every day with no change-up. Bring a 12-pack of Monster or kiss your mind goodbye.
Poor upper management, lack of organization
Nothing bad with them. They fine
Robots are slowly taking over jobs, get sent home often do to being slow at times, timed on trucks or putting product away and get writes ups if certain times aren't met, put it reasons for down times, but often denied those reasons giving you a negative time which leads to write ups.
Management sucks, but what company has good managers in this industry
Long shifts, short breaks, lots of standing, strict managers, low morale
pay: it only go up 50 cent after a year
Hours were very long Supervisors
Very liberal work environment. Pay not great.
Vacation/PTO is not the easiest to follow and it can be difficult to take it because you're unsure of the amount you have. Pay is also at the low end of the spectrum
Corporate woke nonsense a plenty, far more talk than action fixing foundational system and process gaps/failures, and too few people in leadership with any technical acumen for a data-driven service model.
- too much middle management/superfluous roles for such a low margin company/industry - your experience varies too much depending on location/manager you have, so lack of consistent culture Overall, it’s the largest company in its industry but it still has low margins like its competitors so unless you’re at a good location I wouldn’t stay very long as the compensation (pay, etc) is unlikely to be worth the effort/commitment you’ll have to make. Consider a different industry.
Not many downsides I can think of.
I landed a career with this company back in July of last year. I worked at the E-Solutions site in Fairburn GA. It was nice when I first started working the management was welcoming as well as the warehouse associates. The place took a huge nose dive when one of the supervisors left in January. There is a lack of accountability from upper level management. This site has been running into the same hurdles prior to my arrival at the site. From employees being on their cell phones. People practicing unsafe behaviors. For example the site lifts heavy box furniture, while completing order selection it’s suppose to be two associates doing team lift to for those heavy boxes. Since I have been there I’ve noticed associates on the floor with their cell phone out while upper level management doesn’t bat an eye. People are not being in their assigned work area. In addition, there is no accountability in the office. Upper level management say they are for the people but truly they are not. Multiple occasions, I have stayed over and ensured things got done and ensured I motivated my team to get goals completed for today. It was not enough for them
Loose supervision and accountability on General Managers, slaps on the wrist when they make mistakes. No bonus and not extremely competitive salaries.
Many different challenges and opportunities
This is a good place to work.
Almost everyone here is depressed and beat down. Management is consistently on your back about LMS numbers and doesn't look at the full picture. Raises stop after 4 years. Alot of favoritism here.
Field techs sometimes don't get to work with colleagues outside of remote conference that often.
There isn't any for me they know what there doing.
Mobility to other locations around the country are limited.
No more sick pay, no more vacation pay, and no more holiday pay, as of 2/14/23, in Wichita Kansas
The slow days really drag
Hr mistreats the employees throughout the company
Some times not a lot of room for career growth

So far my only complaint is that they didn't go over this health care and benefits package better. I'm lost in doing this. I'm not sure I'm even on the right site now to set it up.
Communication can be an issue
No no no no no
Unexpected OT on some weekends and throughout the week. But that's all part of working in Supply Chain.
No more sick pay, no more vacation pay, and no more holiday pay, as of 2/14/23, in Wichita Kansas
The slow days really drag
Hr mistreats the employees throughout the company
Communication with the workers Be more organized
-Very “favorites are better” atmosphere -Too much work gossip / actual fights between workers -Have to pick up after other workers quite a bit
No overtime offered for supervisors
Mostly Long hours Repetitive work
Having the ability to progress quickly in your career if you cannot relocate
Micromanaging is the way of life there
Lack of career advancement within my office
Very early start time Some routes too long
There is a lot of walking.
The work can overwhelm sometimes
So far my only complaint is that they didn't go over this health care and benefits package better. I'm lost in doing this. I'm not sure I'm even on the right site now to set it up.
Communication can be an issue
Not a great amount of support just starting out
No no no no no
Unexpected OT on some weekends and throughout the week. But that's all part of working in Supply Chain.
HR was so difficult to get to. Management could do some work. Workers didn't really have the enthusiasm to actually work. Multiple changes to schedules.
No advancement and try to get rid of you after a year
Mandatory overtime sometimes. We had a week in the last year we had to work 10 hour days, five days a week + 6 hrs on the weekend.
Terrible communication from management. Management refuses to take action on issues raised by employees and will do anything it can to cut cost to the company, even if it negatively affects the lives and safety of their own employees. Work expectations are often increased weekly, but pay has barely changed in years and mandatory overtime has been pushed harder and harder.
Incredibly dull work. You are very much a cog in the machine.
No overtime offered for supervisors
No family life. Can't turn down over time. Long shifts of 12 hours Training isn't there.
* Low pays * lot of noise * only one break
Mostly Long hours Repetitive work

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Banana-Republic-Reviews-E23057.htm,"As a brand Gap is pretty great to their employees and so Banana is the same. Friends and family Generous discount Upper management does what they can to make you feel supported
nice place to work for a starting sales associate
Everyone below a VP level is fantastic and creative. Beautiful offices, good time off and good benefits.
-maybe flexible scheduling based on your manager(s) -15 min break for 4 hour shift, 30 min for 6 hour, 1 hour for 8 hours and above - snacks sometimes provided - was previously an all-black dress code but has changed to a neutral color dress code - boutique-style visual environment can make you feel nice
- Always something to do - Brand is expanding so new roles are being created within brick and mortar stores - Development and training is very detailed and available (when you have ingested leaders) - Flexible scheduling - Generous discount across all gap inc brands
Great benefits such as health care, employee discount
Management was professional and well-organized in communication and store management. It made things easier to handle.
Employee discount,Benefits are good, team is amazing
Loved the discount for the employees.
The culture in Banana Republic is wonderful , however the concept is in jeopardy for brick and mortar stores especially in small markets. I have now closed 2 stores and while being profitable; making KPI's, credit and customer service scores and balancing all elements of leading a team. As much as I enjoyed working there the stress of another store closing makes me leery of leading another team as I do not have control or input over property management decisions regarding rent. Double digit increases in comp and gross margin do not compete with absurd rent increases and corporate companies rightfully have to make decisions based upon financials. My brain understands but my heart hurts for my employees and community. Ask questions and if in a smaller market proceed with caution.
discount is 60% get to do lots of stuff
This is a great entry-level job if you hope to one day manage a store. Good upwards movement in the company.
I just want to use Glassdoor.
Great teammates. Rockefeller location is the flagship so it had many items and many tourists. Was happy to be part of the Gap Inc. Family. Great employee discounts at Banana, Gap, Old Navy, and others.
Flexible, room to grow, many different avenues for success
I worked there during college because they were flexible with scheduling. Your experience depends on the management, my store manager was a micromanager but everyone else was cool.
Flexible with hours depending on manager
Pay Benefits Career opportunities Culture
I love Banana Republic great team! I love going to work everyday, working on weekends and holidays! Absolutely terrific!!
The team you work with are wonderful
The workplace offers a flexible environment with exceptionally supportive colleagues, promoting a healthy work-life balance. The office itself is beautiful.
Helped me gain experience as a student.
I really loved the environment, extremely relaxed and also rewarding with customers that you easily can connect with and help with their needs. Also management was also helpful in giving tips to make you more keen on your role and how to help. They would often to help you with pitch ideas for selling store cards. So it was pretty easy
I enjoyed my time at Banana Republic. The managers always went above and beyond to help the sales associate.

I enjoyed the styling and interacting with customers
Absolutely loved the work, loved the location, loved the product...but BR will hire any jerk off the street and my team at some points was complete riffraff. No shows, walk offs, inappropriate behavior. It was hard to fire people and hard to find replacements. But otherwise i absolutely loved my job
There weren’t any pros sorry
The culture of the brand

Friendly coworkers, pay is slightly higher than minimum wage
people you work with are nice
- friendly staff - decent pay for partime
Diverse work place Flexible hours
good nice fun exciting great
","Performance reviews don't happen fast or often enough in terms of performance raises. The training structure could be better
the outlets have very high and very low peaks of business.
It is nearly impossible to feel successful or empowered in a role there. The president of the company wastes money like it’s nothing and changes her mind with the wind. She makes no effort to know any of her employees, even those at a senior or director level. VPs drink the koolaid and I know several people have left due to bullying and harsh treatment. Gap considers itself a responsible company but one VP has been reported to HR so many times and HR claims they are doing something but they do nothing. It’s all lip service. Good work is not rewarded, it is often only criticized and never praised. It’s a Mean Girls mentality there and there is absolutely zero strategy beyond the whim of the president who knows absolutely nothing about clothing or style. No one is trusted to actually do their job. Everyone is micromanaged within an inch of their life and she is disliked by everyone in every department. No one respects her in a true sense of the word. She rules (as do her VPs) with fear and I would venture to say there are very few, if any, happy corporate employees there. Many many 5am and 10pm phone calls and texts. No boundaries whatsoever.
-too much work (atelier client sign ups, credit card sales, loyalty reward sign ups, regular sales, high customer service quality) with no commission - have to keep track of own sales, sign ups, and atelier sign ups daily on a sheet - will put your name out on a platform for everyone to see if you do not sell a card for the month -required all-store meetings where headquarters or district managers will attend even for part-timers -company has been changing store to a boutique style in a visuals and marketing but does not pay workers enough for required above and beyond service to customers -store rules, marketing tactics, and product information are constantly changing because headquarters keep on trying new directions for the rebranding of banana - very picky about dress code and needs to be dressed in layers with accessories without burdened expenses or free pieces from the company - some stores also have furniture or special art pieces that require extra product information for you to memorize on top of everything else above - sometimes drama or gossip within
- Work life balance (it’s not always consistent) - have to work on holidays - if you’re not agile, you will fail.
There is no work-life balance.
Some of the customers were a challenge but we got through it as a team. Changing schedules was something to deal with.
it is retail ,so work-life balance is not giving
Gets really busy on the weekend.
Store closures as Banana Republic tries to find relevancy in today's market. Career opportunities decreasing due to shrinking market.
can be boring when no customers depends on staff your enjoyment
Working in a mall all day.
Nothing I graduated out it was a decent job.
They really pushed opening the banana republic credit card and meeting sales goals. I was pretty good at it since I’m a high achiever, but if you’re looking for a regular job to pay the bills without the stress of meeting goals, you may need to reconsider applying.
Working holidays, weekends, small management teams
Just expect to work weekends.
We’re required to sell credit cards constantly
Growth Senior management Inclusion Work/life balance
Nothing. Just a great place!
The hours can be long
The salary offered is quite low and it's important to keep in mind that annual increases are typically limited to around 1-2.5%.
Pressure to get credit card sign ups.
Sometimes the hours were a drag , meaning you might not get a lot of hours because of the number of staff on hand.
Low pay and not many available hours.
late hours on weekends and early hours for shipment days
Not great to stay long term
Managers are annoying about selling the credit card and loyalty programs. No one wants a credit card these days and they force you to try and sell it to everyone.
paid poorly in my opinion
do not get any hours if you don't sell a credit card
They really push credit card sales and put associates against each other who do not get many cards. Also can be really hard when not meeting KPIs in a day
Nothing to share that is a con personally
Uncommunicative Can get overwhelming at times
Inconsistently in senior leadership. Expectations are not clear.
The cons would be since it is a very high end clothing retail store there is not much traffic and I hardly ever work and it just doesn't feel like a job anymore.
Management was overly focused on credit card sign ups and less about the experience provided to customers
-Not enough hours in the day to proficiently complete all needed taskwork and workload -Management positions are all consuming -Inefficient Store Operating Model, based on hard numbers and random selection, rather than each leaders strengths and weaknesses -Mistakes chastised, even if trivial -Too understaffed and overworked to fully or even partially utilize all company given resources and tools and training -Cultish culture around company loyalty programs and credit cards, often leads to tone deaf and insensitive manipulative business tactics so coerce customers into signing up
Low pay and mostly would only get scheduled for 4-5 hour shifts
These was no cons to speak of
corporate mandatory quotas. No corporate management involvement in trainings or workshops for employees
None, it is a typical retail job
Managers are annoying about selling the credit card and loyalty programs. No one wants a credit card these days and they force you to try and sell it to everyone.
Getting people to sign up for credit cards is pushed down everyone's throat, they want you to harass the customers which is something i was not comfortable with. I had a degree in Fashion Merchandising and had worked in retail for years and was treated as if I was 16 and this was my first job.
Too much is expected for a small hourly wage. There is also a lot of pressure to sign people up for store cards.
Work holidays. Overwhelming from time to time.
Nothing to share that is a con personally
Sometimes the fit of items can be unflattering for individuals with physiques similar to my own
A con of working here is they are not very flexible
Uncommunicative Can get overwhelming at times
Low pay and mostly would only get scheduled for 4-5 hour shifts
Main manager thinks she’s too above her employees and they edit you time clock for lunch breaks if you go past the 5th mark accidentally so you don’t get additional pay.
busy hours, Long shifts, Weekends, Early morming
Discount do no apply to online ordering
Salary and hrs. Meeting huddles, perfume smell in store
Toxic culture and a lot of gossip
The complete crazy lunatics the would hire. And external theft, there was a lot of that
Sexist mangers that talk down to you .
There’s none cons, the company does very well for their employees
Banana card pressure and mean managers
No cons to really mention
Commission was not offered for this role that had an expectation to deliver sales goals monthly

Too much is expected for a small hourly wage. There is also a lot of pressure to sign people up for store cards.
Lots of employee turnover can be long hours
Work holidays. Overwhelming from time to time.
Emphasis on getting credit card signups is very annoying
Some difficult customers, mostly people who just don’t know how to read or want to argue
Sometimes the fit of items can be unflattering for individuals with physiques similar to my own
A con of working here is they are not very flexible
not a lot of room for growth to develop
heavy workload, pressure from hq without much support
Little room for advancement and promotion.
Almost too structured, not a lot of room for innovation
My cons have to do with working retail in general, not the actual company.
Sometimes work is not flexible
little to no pay raises i mean, it's retail RARE bonuses
Store management can be unruly at times. Corporate initiatives can be difficult to apply in practice.
No cons at the moment
Main manager thinks she’s too above her employees and they edit you time clock for lunch breaks if you go past the 5th mark accidentally so you don’t get additional pay.
way too many managers - better pay based on exp.
Closing shifts end later than other stores
There are no cons at this job
I do not have thing particular which I didn’t like
-No growth -Not a lot of transparency/ lack of communication from corporate -Workload doesn't seem to be though out together with partners as competing commitments tend to clash
toxic work culture unqualified leaders poor team structure minimal diversity
Management is not the best
The athleisure and business casual rebrand is convenient but does not incorporate the traditional business attire at all making it a hassle to explain to consumers. Not enough training on the traditional lines.
Pay is low, hardly get any promotion! They cut hours suddenly and sometimes on the same work day!
Selling credit cards, pressure to complete tasks in determined times, no guarantee of hours of work.
There are sometimes poor staffing issues
Low salary with gap company
hard work time consuming crowded stressful hard
Higher turnover in management has been an issue.
Salary among new to seasoned employees varies and is usual more for newer employees
Not a lot. I've enjoyed my time here!
Device apps malfunction sometimes, lack of better cashwrap training for more specific out of ordinary transactions
Not very through training, rude customers, not very good pay, horrible hours
not enough hours, can't pay for bills on a 25 hour wage
- Scheduling could be better
Little pay Long hours standing
good none don’t have any i don’t know

","Arranging high level leaders at short notice.
Good and Bad like loads of over time and if ever injured document document..#Ochersafety saw many were injured due to lack of people.. many others I'd like to speak highly but White Collar Crime president amd Union go hand in hand .. if work here be extra careful and hope it's enough 8 years 1 injury and being punished for reporting it. I HAD TO AGREE TO VERY LITTLE they waited about 4 months to offer and ready to move on especially my family may move on without me while I await the Company to do as they say so I can have my life back and my abled body they sure are awesome at pause #whitecollarcrime Kayla writing this for Dad people need to know . OTHER THEN THAT A GREAT PLACE TO WORK BUT BAD PLACE TO GET INJURED
Relocation requirements for career advancement
its just cold but that is due to the products requirement.
Not the best work life balance.
Pay can be below market rate.
No cons working for Cargill
Tough to get a raise without a promotion
beneath the surface there is a lot of chaos, little direction and lots of blame when deliverables are due too hard to get the information I need to do my job too much information dumped on you at one time and they expect you to own it right away too much emphasis on ""development"" which is an extra task to do on top of your jobThe demographics are dissappointing - It's a good place for middle aged white men from the midwest They'll be flexible with you you, can take some time off, but that pile of work will be there when u get back and they will resume with all their questions and requests   cool research happening but its too hard to find out what ofher ppl are doing because you're so overwhelmed with running your own experiments, getting it to work, and then reporting that out through various channels, in various meetings, at different levels of detail. culture of being nice and indirect - very passive agressive - this is revealed during performance reviews which occur twice per year long standing relationships - people have known each other over 10 years, their kids know eachother - hard for a new person to get viewed objectively, easy for older ppl to get a pass on improper conduct, language in the workplace Ppl at this job have internalized the brand - hard to know if you're talking to a real person or a brainwashed person Lots of lip service around diversity equity and inclusion - ppl just repeat whatever the latest company policy is
It's a very large company and you won't gain much notoriety
It's a very large company and you won't gain much notoriety
Pay is average compared to other places
the cons arent coming to mind but i kno there has to be.
It was a cold barn.
longer hours, there is a lot going on everyday
It was long hours and the supervisory team would stand over your shoulder and tell you work work faster while watching TikTok’s with each other. This was also during Covid.
Disorganized with consistent ""transformations"" and reorganization. There have been 4 changes in the past 5 years. Toxic Culture Very little change can happen and seems that people re managing their careers. Cargill is so big that it depends on what function and business unit you join. People's experiences vary greatly. Warning about Cargill, it widely depends on where you sit within Cargill. This is a warning for the HR corporate function in MN.
Schedule is great if you have no social life. The hours are weird and having to work night shift is terrible. I've missed countless family events. Being on shift and being called in on your weekends off when no one else can cover shifts isn't too uncommon. They take awhile to replace higher up positions.
I can’t think of any.
bonus is arbitrary progress can be slow in such a large organization
Not easy to grow and find new opportunities
Every team is different, might get “stuck” in an area
Physical pain, long hours, but that's par the course.
Schedule is a bit of an adjustment
It was long hours and the supervisory team would stand over your shoulder and tell you work work faster while watching TikTok’s with each other. This was also during Covid.
I do not have much to say.
Lots of process and internal barriers to navigate

working conditions with aging equipment
Dock doors and forklift break down
I don’t have any cons
Pay is a little on the short side compared to other large Ag trading firms
Workload involves managing uncertainty and constant turnover
Rotating 12 hour schedule sucks
Many complaints about base salaries being below a fair market rate.
Poor management Never fully Staffed for very long
Fall can be a busy time of year
It was hot. Not everyone helped with the community stuff.
Management don’t listen to their employees
management has favorites. work load is heavy compared to workers
none - exceptional company to work for if corporate environment is desired
Minimal PTO carry over, which leads to everyone taking off at the end of each fiscal year
very large, somewhat slow to make decisions
For many years this was the best place to work. The IT function has now gone into a tailspin with leaders who truly don’t care about people one bit, all the good employees are leaving in droves
-hard to move around unless you know the people in the deprartment you are trying to get into. -very young workforce often times this is their first job ever. -
Hierarchy can stifle at times; Still run from the top by traders/commodity mindset versus specialty/value-added
Hours and schedule but you make good money.
Pay was lower than what I expected
Seems too big at times.
Nothing, not management, I love cargill
Small pockets of toxicity. No real processes. Slow response time.
Environment favored African Americans. Reverse discrimination was² quite obvious. I
Long shifts, rotating shifts, and when parts break down you often have to make do with spare parts laying around and weld them to work.
Bad middle management. Plenty of old dinasours waiting to get their remitement pensions from back in the day
Is it hard for sanitation?
Too many chiefs, barking orders. They all pile the workload up on one guy then bash him for not being able to do everything they want done. No win situation here. Absolutely terrible place to work! You’re always wrong with this group of imbecile’s!!
Unreal expectations, management not in touch with customer base or employees. Management wants what it wants, they don’t want to hear objective opinions.
It was a very fast-paced work environment.
Disorganized structure, from from the city, lack of resources
Hours and schedule but you make good money.
Need equil pay. People have been there for 15 years or more and getting out paid by new hires. This company needs audited. And individual employees need to be able to freely speak their mind without discipline. Especially in maintenance, on the packaging side, 💩 for management. Poor supervision did I mention. Senior management micro manages and has a one track mind. This place is all politics, and everyone in management is out for themselves. Taking credit for the good at every opportunity.
Pay was lower than what I expected
Seems too big at times.
Nothing, not management, I love cargill
Supervisors were not very aware of how things were run, and most did not seem interested to learn. Long hours, mandatory overtime depending on time of year. Unexpected extra hours if you work the last shift.
Small pockets of toxicity. No real processes. Slow response time.
Management Raises Constant new employees No growth.
Never paid for what you're worth. Always given work a level above your pay grade for ""development"" but never rewarded for it. Insurance is expensive and you have a crazy high deductible/max out of pocket. Promotions are usually who you know or to meet diversity goals, not what you know or past performance. No matter how good the company performs, always a reason to cut back on bonus payouts
Long shifts, rotating shifts, and when parts break down you often have to make do with spare parts laying around and weld them to work.
A dirty and sometimes dangerous job. A lot of physical labor
Not too sure too many cons
Swing shift is sometimes a pain
Unorganized, no performance reviews, difficult to accomplish work
Some issues with personnel can be overlooked.
Hard exhausting work. Expect to always be on your feet. If there’s nothing to do, they want you to find something,anything. Favoritism and nepotism going on here. Never worked a simple 40 hour week. Always have to stay later.
None to note for Cargill
A traditional culture that is lacking diversity.
Minnesota nice, consensus based culture.
No overtime lately 40 hours only
- Exceedingly high expectations with unrealistic timelines - Managers don't know how to manage well - Constantly having to prove it wasn't your mistake or defend desicions - Called morning / night and on weekends
Excessive hours for management team and equipment ran into the ground with constant failures. Poor High deductible insurance while Cargill family makes billions in profit.
Somewhat slow, bureaucratic and opaque decision making and prioritization.
It’s not a meritocracy, ability to advance is very much driven by relationships. Matrix organization slows decision making. Poor performers are tolerated.
Low pay, long hours, and too much favoritism.
I don't have any con
Hours and benefits could be better but not necessarily off market.
Work life-balance is terrible. The salary doesn’t reflect the responsibility of the job
A dirty and sometimes dangerous job. A lot of physical labor
Poor pay for most levels of the organization. Working on it, but lagging.
Not too sure too many cons
Swing shift is sometimes a pain
crew can be hard to get along with

- The staff is not very diverse - Feels like a dead end, there isn't much room for growth and not much support from management to promote from within - A lot of the employees are very unprofessional and disrespectful - The pay isn't quite fair for the hazardous work you are doing - Working outside could be looked at as a con if you are one who is bothered by the weather conditions for extended amounts of time - The training is not very structured - The management acts like 65 hours a week is a ""normal"" schedule, work life balance pretty much does not exist and it's super toxic expectation from the management, employees will get burnout and quit eventually or constantly have personal life issues due to lack of work life balance, either outcome will negatively impact this place and it's people
A traditional culture that is lacking diversity.

Wages are not comparable to industry
Not so fantastic if you're a union employee - lack of benefits, strict point system, no sick leave and little PTO.
